In addition, our President and CEO submitted an annual CEO Certification to the New York Stock Exchange on May 2, 2006 in accordance with the NYSE listing standards. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non U.S. economic and industry conditions, a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may face decreased demand or price reductions for our products. Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive. Because of the diversity of products we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers, establish relationships with new customers, continually develop new products and services designed to maintain our leadership position in various product categories and penetrate new markets. Our failure to compete effectively may reduce our revenues, profitability and cash flow, and pricing pressures may adversely impact our profitability. Technologies, product offerings and customer requirements in many of our markets change rapidly. If we fail to keep up with these changes, we may not be able to meet our customers needs and demand for our products may decline. If we pursue technologies that do not become commercially accepted, customers may not buy our products or use our services. Rapid technological change and frequent introductions of new products and services characterize many of the markets we serve. Changes in regulations can also impact demand for new products in our markets. Our failure to successfully embrace and respond to these changes and developments may reduce our revenues and cash flow and adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully embrace and respond to these changes and developments, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, if customers do not adopt the technologies that we develop or if those technologies ultimately prove not to be viable, our revenues, cash flow and profitability may suffer. Our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital. Conversely, any inability to consummate acquisitions at our prior rate could negatively impact our growth rate. As part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course, some of which may be material. During 2006 we acquired eleven businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.7 billion (including transaction costs and net of cash acquired); during 2005 we acquired 13 businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $885 million (including transaction costs and net of cash acquired); and during 2004 we acquired 13 businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.6 billion (including transaction costs and net of cash acquired). Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could cause significant operating inefficiencies and adversely affect our growth and profitability: Any acquired business, technology, service or product could under perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it. Acquisition related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results. Acquisitions could place unanticipated demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. We could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other systems. We may be unable to achieve cost savings anticipated in connection with the integration of an acquired business. We may assume by acquisition unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known 12 Table of Contents liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, or internal control deficiencies. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial position. Conversely, we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at similar rates to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate. Our ability to achieve our growth goals depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings. In addition, changes in accounting or regulatory requirements could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions. The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of each of their companies before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may not be able to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position. The resolution of contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We have retained responsibility for some of the known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold, such as lawsuits, product liability claims and environmental matters, and agreed to indemnify the purchasers of these businesses for certain known and unknown contingent liabilities. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition but we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue. Our success depends on our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and avoid claims of infringement or misuse of third party intellectual property. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our operations. The steps we have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations. In addition, from time to time in the usual course of business, we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. In the event of a successful claim against us, we could lose our rights to needed technology or be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights, any of which could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and cash flows. Even where we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs which could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows. We are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business, including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products, claims relating to intellectual property matters and claims involving employment matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters and acquisition related matters. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition, operations and results of operations. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. Our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities, costs, litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and establish standards for the generation, treatment, use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the U.S. and abroad in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in substantial compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters. We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our 13 Table of Contents financial condition, results of operations and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation. In addition to the environmental regulations noted above, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non U.S. governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels, including the following: We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the FDA, by counterpart agencies of other countries and by regulations governing the management, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials. Violations of these regulations, efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products can lead to warning letters, declining sales, recalls, seizures, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre market notification rescissions. We also have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. Our agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costs. A failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services, and damage to our reputation. Our reputation and our ability to do business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and or non U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, competition, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries, and could damage our reputation. Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition or performance of, key distributors, resellers and other channel partners could adversely affect our results of operations. Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors, resellers and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors products, and if they favor our competitors products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, or adverse developments in their financial condition or performance, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully. If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated performance results from those businesses, effectively implement the Danaher Business System throughout our organization and achieve the cost savings and other benefits that the effective implementation of the Danaher Business System can achieve, and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations. 14 Table of Contents Cyclical economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that have historically experienced periodic downturns, which have adversely impacted demand for the equipment and services that we manufacture and market. Any downturn or competitive pricing pressures in these industries could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in any given period. Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. In addition, certain of our customers receive reimbursement from government insurance programs for some of the costs of the products that they purchase from us. Any significant change in any of these regulations or reimbursement programs could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products. Foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Changes in currency exchange rates and commodity prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials, components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand, our business and financial results will suffer. We purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations. If we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase. For example, although there have been no recent raw materials shortages that have had a material adverse impact on our business, market forces during the past two years have caused significant increases in the costs of steel and petroleum based products, and with respect to the past year, non ferrous metals as well. In addition, because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed our production requirements or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs. We have a number of domestic collective bargaining units and various non U.S. collective labor arrangements. While we generally have experienced satisfactory relations at our various locations, we are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs. International economic, political, legal and business factors could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In 2006, approximately 49% of our sales were derived outside the U.S. and we continue to increase our sales outside the U.S. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the U.S. Our international business is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non U.S. operations and could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and overall growth, including: interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers; changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions; trade protection measures; import or export licensing requirements; unexpected changes in laws or licensing and regulatory requirements; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; 15 Table of Contents differing labor regulations; differing protection of intellectual property; and terrorist activities and the U.S. and international response thereto. Audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities. Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our operating results. Our defined benefit pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates and the majority of plan assets are invested in publicly traded debt and equity securities, which are affected by market risks. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may adversely impact our future operating results. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS NONE ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located in Washington, D.C. At December 31, 2006, we had 218 significant manufacturing and distribution locations worldwide, comprising approximately 20 million square feet, of which approximately 12 million square feet are owned and approximately 8 million square feet are leased. Of these manufacturing and distribution locations, 117 facilities are located in the United States and 101 are located outside the United States, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia, the rest of North America, Latin America and Australia. The number of manufacturing and distribution locations by business segment are: Professional Instrumentation, 54; Medical Technologies, 49; Industrial Technologies, 78; and Tools & Components, 37. We consider our facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. Please refer to Note 10 in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information with respect to our lease commitments. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS As previously reported, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) has informed Joslyn Sunbank Company LLC (Joslyn Sunbank), a subsidiary of the Company, that its Paso Robles, California facility allegedly violated certain provisions of the California Hazardous Waste Control Law (HWCL) and related regulations. The DTSC alleges certain deficiencies related to recordkeeping and reporting matters, training and preventive measures and hazardous waste storage and handling practices. The DTSC has acknowledged that Joslyn Sunbank is no longer in violation of the HWCL or related regulations and that Joslyn Sunbank has taken appropriate corrective action in response to the alleged violations. The DTSC and Joslyn Sunbank have reached an agreement in principle whereby all of Joslyn Sunbanks alleged violations of the HWCL and related regulations would be settled for $495,000. The settlement agreement would also include certain injunctive relief under which Joslyn Sunbank would agree to follow specified procedures relating to recordkeeping and reporting, training and preventive measures and hazardous waste storage and handling. The parties expect to reflect the terms of the agreement in principle in a settlement agreement that is being negotiated. The Company does not believe that the final resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. In addition to the litigation noted under Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental, Health & Safety, we are, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of our products, claims relating to intellectual property matters and claims involving employment matters and commercial disputes. We may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages. While we maintain workers compensation, property, cargo, automobile, crime, fiduciary, product, general liability, and directors and officers liability insurance (and have acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) that we believe covers a portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. In addition, while we believe we are entitled to indemnification from third 16 Table of Contents parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. We believe that the results of these litigation matters and other pending legal proceedings will not have a materially adverse effect on our cash flows or financial condition, even before taking into account any related insurance or indemnification recoveries. We maintain third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. We carry significant deductibles and self insured retentions under our insurance policies, and our management believes that we maintain adequate accruals to cover the retained liability. Our management determines our accrual for self insurance liability based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. ITEM 4.

MANAGEME NTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with its audited consolidated financial statements. OVERVIEW Danaher Corporation strives to create shareholder value through: delivering sales growth, excluding the impact of acquired businesses, in excess of the overall market growth for its products and services; upper quartile financial performance when compared against peer companies; and upper quartile cash flow generation from operations when compared against peer companies. To accomplish these goals, the Company uses a set of tools and processes, known as the DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM (DBS), which are designed to continuously improve business performance in critical areas of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. The Company also acquires businesses that it believes can help it achieve the objectives described above. The Company will acquire businesses when they strategically fit with existing operations or when they are of such a nature and size as to establish a new strategic line of business. The extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and integrated can significantly affect the Companys overall growth and operating results. Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. In 2006, approximately 49% of Danahers sales were derived outside the United States. As a global business, Danahers operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry economic and political factors. However, Danahers geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of its product sales and services, has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the outlook for the Company. The Companys individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. In addition, the Companys order rates are highly indicative of the Companys future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance. In those industry segments where the Company is a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the Companys customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy. The Company continues to operate in a highly competitive business environment in the markets and geographies served. The Companys performance will be impacted by its ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in the markets and geographies it serves, including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force, consolidation of competitors, the expansion of market opportunities in Asia, increasing significance of technology and intellectual property in the businesses in which the Company operates and recent increases in raw material costs. The Company will continue to assess market needs with the objective of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner. With the acquisition of Sybron Dental Specialties, Inc. (Sybron Dental) and Vision Systems Limited (Vision), Company management and other personnel are devoting significant attention to the successful integration of these businesses into Danaher. The Company has significantly expanded its medical technologies segment since it acquired its first medical technologies businesses in 2004. In May 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sybron Dental. Sybron Dental is a leading manufacturer of a broad range of products for the dental professional and had annual revenues of approximately $650 million in its most recent completed fiscal year. Danaher paid total consideration of approximately $2 billion for the Sybron Dental shares, including transaction costs and net of $94 million of cash acquired, and assumed approximately $182 million of debt. Sybron Dental is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Companys dental business both through the growth of existing products and services and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. In addition, in the last quarter of 2006 and first quarter of 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Vision for an aggregate price of approximately $520 million, including transaction costs and net of $122 million of cash acquired and assumed $1.5 million of debt. Vision, based in Australia, manufactures and markets automated instruments, antibodies and biochemical reagents used for biopsy based detection of cancer and infectious diseases, and had revenues of approximately $86 million in its last completed fiscal year. Management believes that the pairing of Vision with the Companys existing life science instrumentation business, Leica, will significantly broaden the Companys product offerings in the growing anatomical pathology market and expand the sales and growth opportunities for both the Leica and Vision businesses. The Company believes that the pairing of Leica and Vision will also create a broader base for the acquisition of complementary businesses in the life sciences industry. Danaher financed the acquisitions of Sybron Dental and Vision primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and to a lesser extent from available cash. Under the global commercial paper program which the Company established in May 2006, the Company, or an indirect wholly owned financing subsidiary of the Company, may issue and sell unsecured, short term promissory 20 Table of Contents notes in aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.2 billion. The credit facilities provide credit support for the commercial paper program and have the practical effect of reducing the maximum amount of commercial paper that the Company can issue under the commercial paper program from $2.2 billion to $1.5 billion. On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued approximately $630 million (500 million) of 4.5% guaranteed notes due July 22, 2013 with a fixed re offer price of 99.623 in a private placement outside the U.S. (the Eurobond Notes). Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were 496 million and were used to repay a portion of the Companys outstanding commercial paper issued to acquire Sybron Dental and for general corporate purposes. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R) which requires the Company to expense stock based compensation. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective application method of adoption, which requires the Company to record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of December 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining service periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. Although the Company has a U.S. Dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, a substantial portion of its sales and profits are derived from foreign countries. Sales and profits of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated using exchange rates effective during the respective period. Therefore, reported sales and profits are affected by changes in currency rates, which are outside of the control of management. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales and profit in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The borrowings under the Eurobond Notes, as well as the European component of the commercial paper program, provide a natural hedge to a portion of the Companys European net asset position. On an overall basis, the U.S. Dollar weakened against other major currencies in 2006 and closed the year at exchange rate levels weaker than the exchange rate levels as of the end of 2005. While differences exist among the Companys businesses, the Company generally experienced broad based sales growth in 2006. Revenue growth rates for each of the quarters of 2006 exceeded growth rates for each of the comparable quarters of 2005. Management believes that this revenue growth reflects the impact of strong global economic conditions, the continued shift of the Companys operations into higher growth sectors of the economy, the Companys investments in growing new markets and products, comparisons against more modest sales growth periods in 2005 and generally higher prices for the Companys products in 2006 compared to 2005. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased approximately 20% over the comparable period of 2005. Sales from existing businesses (references to sales from existing businesses in this report include sales from acquired businesses starting from and after the first anniversary of the acquisition, but exclude currency effect) contributed 6.5% growth. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 13% growth. The impact of currency translation on sales provided approximately 0.5% growth as the weakness of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies in the second half of 2006 more than offset the strengthening of the U.S. dollar experienced in the first quarter of 2006. Price increases contributed approximately 1.5% growth on a year over year basis, and are included in the increase in sales from existing businesses. The growth in sales from acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily related to acquisitions in the Companys medical technologies business. During 2005, the Company acquired four medical technologies businesses, the largest being the acquisition of Leica Microsystems AG in August 2005. The 2006 acquisitions of Sybron Dental in May 2006 and to a lesser extent Vision have also contributed to this revenue growth. Operating profit margins for the Company were 15.8% in the year ended December 31, 2006 essentially the same as in 2005. Following are the key factors impacting the year over year comparison of operating profit margins: As required by SFAS 123R, beginning in the first quarter of 2006 the Company began recording compensation cost related to stock option awards which decreased 2006 operating profit by approximately $55 million and reduced operating profit margins by 60 basis points on a year over year basis; Operating profit margin improvements in the Companys existing operations were offset by the lower operating margins of acquired businesses, primarily Leica and Vision, which reduced 2006 operating margins by 60 basis points on a year over year basis. These results include the expensing of approximately $6.5 million of in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of Vision; 21 Table of Contents Gains related to the sale of a business and the collection of a previously reserved note receivable in the second quarter of 2005 contributed approximately 10 basis points to 2005 operating profit margins impacting the operating margin comparisons for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with 2005; A first quarter 2005 $5.3 million gain on the sale of real estate benefited 2005 operating margins by approximately 5 basis points impacting the operating margin comparisons for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with 2005; A gain on the sale of the Companys investment in First Technology plc in the second quarter of 2006 contributed approximately 15 basis points to 2006 operating profit margins impacting the operating margin comparisons for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with 2005; A loss related to the settlement of patent infringement litigation in the fourth quarter of 2005 reduced operating profit margins by approximately 25 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2005 impacting comparisons with operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2006 also benefited from on going cost reduction initiatives including application of the Danaher Business System and low cost region sourcing and production initiatives and the additional leverage created from sales growth compared with the prior year period. The ongoing application of the Danaher Business System in each of our businesses, and the Companys low cost region sourcing and production initiatives, are both expected to further improve operating profit margins at both existing and newly acquired businesses, including Leica, Sybron Dental and Vision. The Companys effective income tax rate of 22.4% for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects benefits associated with reductions in valuation allowances related to foreign tax credit carryforwards that are now expected to be realized and favorable resolution of examinations of certain previously filed returns which resulted in the reduction of previously provided tax reserves. In addition, the Companys tax provision was reduced as a result of a change in German tax law which entitles the Company to cash payments in lieu of previously held unrecognized tax credits. The Company expects the tax rate for 2007 to be approximately 27%. The following table summarizes sales by business segment for each of the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Professional Instrumentation $ 2,906.5 $ 2,600.6 $ 2,290.6 Medical Technologies 2,219.9 1,181.5 672.9 Industrial Technologies 3,119.2 2,908.1 2,619.5 Tools & Components 1,350.8 1,294.5 1,306.3 Total $ 9,596.4 $ 7,984.7 $ 6,889.3 PROFESSIONAL INSTRUMENTATION The Professional Instrumentation segment encompasses two strategic businesses: environmental and electronic test.

Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, contributed approximately 1.5% to overall sales growth compared to 2005. Sales from existing businesses increased in both of the Companys strategic lines of business. Operating profit margins for the segment were 21.5% in 2006 compared to 20.7% for 2005. Operating profit margin improvements in the segments existing operations were offset by the lower operating margins of acquired businesses which reduced segment operating margins by approximately 40 basis points in 2006 compared to 2005. In addition, the implementation of SFAS 123R reduced operating profit for the segment by approximately $14.7 million and contributed to a 50 basis point reduction in operating profit margins in 2006 compared to 2005. Operating profit margins from existing businesses benefited from on going cost reduction initiatives through application of the Danaher Business System, low cost region sourcing and production initiatives and the additional leverage created from sales growth compared with the prior year period. The ongoing application of the Danaher Business System in each of our businesses, and the Companys low cost region sourcing and production initiatives are both expected to further improve operating profit margins. Overview of Businesses within Professional Instrumentation Segment Environmental. Sales from the Companys environmental businesses, representing approximately 63% of segment sales for 2006, increased approximately 10.5% in 2006 compared to 2005. Sales from existing businesses accounted for approximately 8% growth. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 2% growth and the impact of currency translation accounted for approximately 0.5% growth. The Companys water quality businesses reported mid single digit sales growth for 2006. This growth was primarily the result of strength in Hach/Langes laboratory and process instrumentation products in both the North American and European markets. Sales in Asia grew over 20% in 2006 reflecting continued penetration of these markets. The Companys Hach Ultra Analytics business reported mid single digit growth in 2006. Sales growth in North America and Europe, as well as the impact of new product introductions, drove the improvements. Lower sales in Asia reflecting in part a difficult comparable sales period in 2005 due to certain large projects not repeating in 2006, partially offset these improvements. These businesses continue to focus on growing markets in developing countries such as India and China to enhance their growth prospects. Sales growth from acquired businesses primarily reflects the impact of three smaller acquisitions completed in 2005 and 2006. The Gilbarco Veeder Root retail petroleum product and service business reported high single digit sales growth in 2006 compared to low single digit sales growth in 2005. This growth was driven by extensive refurbishment activity in Europe and regulatory incentives in Mexico that encouraged dispensers to be embedded with tamper proof capability. The businesses newly introduced dispensing equipment and its recently introduced point of sale equipment were favorably received which also contributed to this growth. Electronic Test. Sales from the Companys electronic test businesses, representing approximately 37% of segment sales for 2006, grew 14.5% compared to 2005. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 7.0% growth. Acquisitions accounted for 7.5% growth and currency translation had a negligible impact. Sales growth from existing businesses in 2006 continued the strong growth experienced throughout 2005. The business experienced high single digit growth in traditional industrial channels in all major geographic regions with particular strength in the Asian and Latin American markets. Demand for the businesses thermography and new power quality test products contributed significantly to 23 Table of Contents this overall growth. The Companys network test business reported mid single digit sales growth for 2006 compared to 2005. Sales growth slowed in North America and Europe in 2006 compared to 2005 since 2005 benefited from several new product launches. The network test business experienced somewhat stronger sales growth in China and Latin America in 2006 compared to 2005. 2005 COMPARED TO 2004 Sales of the Professional Instrumentation segment increased 13.5% for 2005 compared to 2004. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, contributed less than 1% to overall sales growth compared to 2004. Sales from existing businesses increased in both of the Companys strategic lines of business with the highest growth resulting from the electronic test and environmental water quality businesses. Sales in the Companys environmental and retail petroleum automation business were up low single digits for the year. Operating profit margins for the segment were 20.7% in 2005 compared to 20.9% for 2004. Operating profit margins in the segment for 2005 compared with 2004 were adversely impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions. These recent acquisitions operate at lower overall operating profit margins than the segments ongoing businesses. Operating profit margins for 2005 were also impacted by higher expense levels to support strategic growth initiatives in certain businesses. On going cost reduction initiatives through the application of the Danaher Business System, low cost region sourcing and production initiatives and the additional leverage created from sales growth compared with the prior year period, partially offset these adverse impacts. Overview of Businesses within Professional Instrumentation Segment Environmental. Sales from the Companys environmental businesses, representing approximately 64% of segment sales for 2005, increased approximately 12.5% in 2005 compared to 2004. Sales from existing businesses accounted for approximately 5.0% growth. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 7.5% growth. The impact of currency translation was negligible for 2005 compared to 2004. The Companys Hach/Lange water quality businesses reported high single digit growth in 2005 primarily driven by mid single digit growth in laboratory sales and low double digit growth in process instrumentation sales in both the United States and European markets. New product launches in 2005 positively impacted process instrumentation sales. The business sales in China also grew over 35% in 2005 on a year over year basis. The Companys Hach Ultra Analytics business reported mid single digit growth in 2005, driven primarily by high single digit growth in the U.S. partially offset by slowing sales in electronics end markets and in Europe. Sales growth from acquired businesses primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition of Trojan Technologies in November 2004 and two smaller water quality businesses during 2005. The Gilbarco Veeder Root environmental and retail petroleum automation business reported low single digit sales growth for 2005 compared to 2004. The business experienced growth in sales of environmental equipment in Asia and Latin America. Sales in Europe were down compared to 2004, due in part to the fact that 2004 sales included the impact of a large shipment. Sales in the U.S. were flat compared to 2004. Electronic Test. Sales from the Companys electronic test businesses, representing approximately 36% of segment sales for 2005, grew 16.0% compared to 2004. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 6.5% growth. Acquisitions accounted for 8.5% growth and favorable currency translation accounted for 1.0% growth. Sales growth from existing businesses for 2005 built on strong performance experienced by this business throughout 2004. Key contributors to the 2005 growth included strength in the U.S. and European industrial and electrical channels, in each case driven by strong demand for recently introduced product offerings. Sales in China also showed strong growth during 2005. The Companys network test business reported flat sales growth for 2005 compared to a very strong 2004. The businesss 2004 results benefited from delivery of a large shipment in the fourth quarter of 2004 for test equipment to service a telecommunication customer. MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES The Medical Technologies segment consists of businesses which offer dentists, other doctors and hospital and research professionals various products and services that are used in connection with the performance of their work. 24 Table of Contents Medical Technologies Selected Financial Data For the years ended December 31($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Sales $ 2,219.9 $ 1,181.5 $ 672.9 Operating Profit 261.6 138.7 76.1 Operating profit as a % of sales 11.8 % 11.7 % 11.3 % Components of Sales Growth 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Existing businesses 8.5 % 2.5 % Acquisitions 78.0 % 75.0 % Currency exchange rates 1.5 % (2.0 )% Total 88.0 % 75.5 % 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 As detailed in the table above, segment sales increased 88% for 2006 compared to 2005. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, contributed approximately 1% to overall sales growth compared to 2005. The Companys dental technology businesses experienced high single digit growth in 2006 compared to 2005. Growth in the dental technology businesses was driven by continued strength in the instrument product lines as well as strong sales of imaging product lines in North America and Asia driven by new product introductions. The Company completed two acquisitions subsequent to December 31, 2006 which will further enhance its imaging product offerings. Sybron Dental experienced low double digit sales growth in 2006, however, all Sybron Dental sales are reported as a component of acquisition growth due to its May 2006 acquisition. Radiometers critical care diagnostics business experienced mid single digit growth in 2006 compared to 2005. Radiometers sales improved in all major geographic regions with particular strength in sales of consumables in Europe resulting from broad based diagnostic instrument placements in the first half of 2006. Leicas life science instrumentation business experienced high single digit growth in 2006 compared to 2005. Strength from the sale of stereo microscopes and specimen preparation equipment drove growth in Europe and Asia, and to a lesser extent North America. Leicas sales have been included as a component of sales from existing businesses since the first anniversary of the acquisition and were reported as a component of acquisition growth prior to that anniversary date. Vision has been consolidated with the segments results as of the date the Company gained control of Vision in November 2006 and its sales are also included as a component of acquisition growth. Operating profit margins for the segment were 11.8% in 2006 compared to 11.7% for 2005. Operating profit margin improvements in the segments existing operations, largely as a result of margin improvements within the dental technology businesses, were offset by the lower operating margins of acquired businesses, primarily Leica and the expensing of in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of Vision which reduced operating profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2006 by approximately 45 basis points compared to 2005. In addition, the implementation of SFAS 123R resulted in approximately $6 million of stock option compensation expense and reduced operating profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2006 by approximately 30 basis points compared to 2005. The Company also recorded a $4.5 million charge in the first quarter of 2006 for impairment of a minority interest in a medical technologies company, which reduced 2006 operating profit margins by approximately 20 basis points compared to 2005. Operating profit margins from existing businesses benefited from on going cost reduction initiatives through application of the Danaher Business System, low cost region sourcing and production initiatives and the additional leverage created from sales growth compared with the prior year period. The ongoing application of the Danaher Business System in each of our businesses, and the Companys low cost region sourcing and production initiatives are both expected to further improve operating profit margins in the segment at both existing and newly acquired businesses, including Leica, Sybron Dental and Vision. 25 Table of Contents 2005 COMPARED TO 2004 Sales of the Medical Technologies segment increased 75.5% for 2005 compared to 2004. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, were negligible in 2005 compared to 2004. Radiometers business experienced mid single digit growth for 2005 over the comparable period of 2004. This performance was primarily the result of growth in North America and Japan, driven by placements of recently introduced products and related accessory sales, offset by weaker performance in Europe. Sales from existing businesses in the Companys dental businesses experienced mid single digit growth in fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. For the full year 2005, the dental businesses sales growth was flat for the period of ownership, but would have reported mid single digit growth on a full year pro forma basis had they been included for a full year in both 2005 and 2004. Sales for 2005 were negatively impacted by changes in German reimbursement regulations as well as the reduction in promotional activity in 2005 while the business restructured certain German operations which occurred in the third and fourth quarters of 2005. Sales for 2005 benefited from strong growth experienced with the introduction of a new digital imaging product offering in the second half of 2005. The business also experienced sales growth due to the third quarter launch of a sensor line with US distribution as well as strong sales growth at Pelton & Crane, a 2005 dental acquisition. The results of Leica have been reflected in the Companys results of operations since its acquisition in August 2005. Leica had annual revenues from continuing operations of approximately $540 million in 2004 (excluding approximately $120 million of revenue attributable to the semiconductor equipment business that was divested shortly after acquisition). Leicas gross margins approximated the Companys overall gross margins and did not had a dilutive impact on gross margins in 2005. However, Leicas operating profit margins are below the Company and segment average and were dilutive to the segment and overall Company operating margins. Operating profit margins for the segment were 11.7% in 2005 compared to 11.3% for 2004. Operating profit margins in the segment for 2005 compared with 2004 were adversely impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, principally Leica and KaVo. In addition, 2005 operating profit margins for the segment reflect additional costs associated with restructuring actions within the dental business, which generally commenced in the third quarter of 2005. Operating profit margins for 2005 were also impacted by higher expense levels to support strategic growth initiatives in certain businesses. On going cost reduction initiatives through the application of the Danaher Business System, low cost region sourcing and production initiatives and the additional leverage created from sales growth compared with the prior year period, partially offset these adverse impacts. INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES The Industrial Technologies segment encompasses two strategic businesses, motion and product identification, and three focused niche businesses, aerospace and defense, sensors & controls and power quality. Industrial Technologies Segment Selected Financial Data For the Years Ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Operating Performance Sales $ 3,119.2 $ 2,908.1 $ 2,619.5 Operating profit 485.5 426.4 383.1 Operating profit as a % of sales 15.6 % 14.7 % 14.6 % 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Components of Sales Growth Existing businesses 6.0 % 5.0 % Acquisitions 1.0 % 6.0 % Currency exchange rates 0.5 % 0.0 % Total 7.5 % 11.0 % 26 Table of Contents 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 Sales growth from existing businesses was due primarily to sales growth in the motion, aerospace and defense and sensor and controls businesses. Price increases, which are included as a component of sales from existing businesses, contributed approximately 1.5% to overall sales growth compared to 2005. Several small acquisitions in 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 accounted for 1% growth. Operating profit margins for the segment were 15.6% in 2006 compared to 14.7% in 2005. The overall improvement in operating profit margins was driven primarily by additional leverage from sales growth, on going cost reductions associated with Danaher Business System initiatives completed during 2005 and 2006, and margin improvements in businesses acquired in prior years, which typically have higher cost structures than the Companys existing operations. Recently acquired businesses had no dilutive impact on overall operating profit margins for 2006. The improvements to operating profit margins were partially offset by the implementation of SFAS 123R which required the Company to record approximately $14.5 million of stock option compensation costs and reduced operating profit margins by 45 basis points in 2006 compared with 2005. Operating profit margin comparisons for 2006 compared to 2005 are also negatively impacted by 35 basis points related to gains on sale of a business and the collection of a previously reserved note receivable during 2005 and were positively impacted by 65 basis points related to a fourth quarter 2005 loss from the settlement of patent infringement litigation. The ongoing application of the Danaher Business System in each of the segments businesses, and the segments low cost region sourcing and production initiatives, are both expected to further improve operating margins at both existing and newly acquired businesses in the segment in future periods. Overview of Businesses within Industrial Technologies Segment Motion. Sales in the Companys motion businesses, representing approximately 33% of segment sales in 2006, increased approximately 6% over 2005. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 5% growth; acquisitions accounted for approximately 0.5% growth and currency translation contributed growth of 0.5%. Sales from existing businesses increased from 2005 levels due primarily to broad based growth across the standard and custom motor, drive and controls lines. This growth was somewhat offset by softness in certain technology end markets. The business also experienced continued growth in sales of its linear products during 2006. Product Identification. The product identification businesses accounted for approximately 27% of segment sales in 2006. Sales from the Companys product identification businesses increased 3.5% in 2006 compared to 2005. Existing businesses provided 2.5% growth. Favorable currency impacts accounted for approximately 1% growth. Acquisitions had a negligible impact on growth for 2006. The increase in sales is due primarily to the increase in sales of laser and thermal transfer overlay equipment as well as sales of consumables and services in North America and Europe. These increases in sales were offset by the completion of several large United States Postal Service (USPS) projects in the first half of 2006 at both AccuSort and Videojet. Focused Niche Businesses. The segments niche businesses in the aggregate showed 11.5% sales growth in 2006 compared to 2005. This growth was primarily driven by strong sales growth from existing businesses in the Companys sensors and controls and aerospace and defense businesses, and to a lesser extent in the Companys power quality businesses. 2005 COMPARED TO 2004 Sales of the Industrial Technologies segment increased 11.0% in 2005 over 2004. Sales from existing businesses increased due primarily to sales growth in the product identification and aerospace and defense businesses. Sales from existing businesses for the Companys motion businesses were flat during 2005 compared to 2004. Price increases, which are included as a component of sales from existing businesses, contributed less than 1% to overall sales growth compared to 2004. The first quarter 2005 acquisition of Linx Printing Technologies PLC together with several other smaller acquisitions in 2005 accounted for a 6.0% increase in segment sales. The impact of currency translation in the year was negligible. Operating profit margins for the segment were 14.7% in 2005 including the effect of a $15.5 million charge (0.5%) to settle litigation associated with activities of a business that occurred prior to the Companys ownership of the business. Under U.S. generally 27 Table of Contents accepted accounting principles, the impact of this settlement is required to be accounted for in 2005 since the settlement occurred after December 31, 2005 but before the release of the 2005 financial statements. Operating profit margins were 14.6% in 2004. The improvements in operating profit margins for the year reflect additional leverage from sales growth; on going cost reductions associated with our Danaher Business System initiatives completed during 2004 and 2005, primarily within the Companys motion businesses; and margin improvements in businesses acquired in prior years, which typically have higher cost structures than the Companys existing operations. Operating margin also benefited from a $4.6 million pre tax gain on the sale of a small business which occurred in the second quarter of 2005. These positive impacts were partly offset by a $5 million impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2005 related to a minority investment; the dilutive effects of operating margins from businesses recently acquired; and higher expense levels to support strategic growth and restructuring initiatives, primarily in the product identification and motion businesses. Overview of Businesses within Industrial Technologies Segment Motion. Sales in the Companys motion businesses, representing approximately 34% of segment sales in 2005, increased approximately 2.5% compared to the same period of 2004. Sales from existing businesses were flat compared with prior year levels; acquisitions accounted for approximately 2.5% growth in sales and the impact of currency translation was negligible. Sales from existing businesses slowed from strong 2004 levels. The business continued to experience strength in its electric vehicle product line, although at lower growth rates than experienced in 2004, as well as growth in the aviation and defense market. In addition, the elevator end market showed continued strength in 2005. However, the business experienced softness in the technology and electronic assembly end markets in 2005. Product Identification. The product identification businesses accounted for approximately 28% of segment sales in 2005. Sales from the Companys product identification businesses increased 26.0% in 2005 compared to 2004. Existing businesses provided 9.5% growth. Acquisitions accounted for 16.0% growth, and favorable currency impacts accounted for approximately 0.5% growth. Sales of marking systems equipment and related service within the Videojet business for 2005 increased at mid single digit rates over 2004. This marking systems growth primarily resulted from strength in the North American, China and Latin American markets. The Company also continued to see growth in both its laser product offerings and thermal transfer overlay product offerings. The Companys increased sales and marketing efforts implemented earlier in 2005 also contributed to this growth. In addition, growth in sales from existing operations for 2005 were driven by strong systems installation sales within the Accu Sort scanning business, particularly sales to the United States Postal Service (USPS). Focused Niche Businesses. The segments niche businesses in the aggregate showed 10.0% sales growth in 2005 compared to 2004. Growth in the existing businesses was primarily driven by sales growth from the Companys aerospace and defense businesses, principally the electro optical and safety product lines as well as strength in the Companys power quality businesses. These improvements were partially offset by slight declines in the Companys sensors and controls business due to a slowing technology market and more difficult comparisons with the business 2004 results which were strong by historical standards. 2005 sales were negatively impacted by 1.0% due to the sale of a small business in June 2005 for which previously reported sales have not been restated. TOOLS & COMPONENTS The Tools & Components segment consists of one strategic line of business, mechanics hand tools, and four focused niche businesses: Delta Consolidated Industries, Hennessy Industries, Jacobs Chuck Manufacturing Company and Jacobs Vehicle Systems. Tools & Components Selected Financial Data For the Years Ended December 31,($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Sales $ 1,350.8 $ 1,294.5 $ 1,306.3 Operating profit 194.1 199.3 198.3 Operating profit as a % of sales 14.4 % 15.4 % 15.2 % 28 Table of Contents Components of Sales Growth 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Existing businesses 4.5 % 4.0 % Divestiture 0.0 % (5.0 %) Currency exchange rates 0.0 % 0.0 % Total 4.5 % (1.0 %) 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 Sales from existing businesses contributed substantially all of the growth for the segment in 2006, including approximately 1.5% growth due to price increases that the Company implemented largely as a result of cost increases in steel and other commodities. Mechanics hand tools sales, representing approximately 70% of segment sales, grew 5% in 2006 compared to 2005. The sales growth was driven primarily by the groups Matco business which achieved high single digit growth during 2006 driven by increases in both the number of distributors and their average purchase levels. The retail mechanics hand tools business also grew in the second half of 2006 compared to the second half of 2005 as sell through at Sears, a major customer of the segment, improved from prior year levels. The business continues to experience growth with its other retail customers as well as expanding markets for the business products in China. The segments niche businesses experienced mid single digit sales growth for 2006 compared to 2005 as strength in the truck box and engine retarder businesses was partially offset by weakness in the chuck business. Operating profit margins for the segment were 14.4% in 2006 compared to 15.4% in 2005. Implementation of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006 reduced segment operating profit by approximately $6 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, negatively impacting year over year operating margins by 45 basis points. The Company also incurred costs associated with exiting a small product line during the second half of 2006 which reduced 2006 operating profit margins by approximately 30 basis points. Operating profit margins also declined during 2006 due to lower margin products accounting for a larger proportion of sales within the segment as well as due to higher overall freight costs. Finally, year over year operating margin comparisons were negatively impacted by approximately 40 basis points as a result of a $5.3 million ($3.9 million after taxes) gain on the sale of real estate in 2005. The adverse impacts on operating margins described above were offset somewhat by the impact of leverage from higher sales levels, including the pricing actions implemented in 2006, as well as the benefit of restructuring actions taken in 2005. The ongoing application of the Danaher Business System in each of the segments businesses and the Companys low cost region sourcing and production initiatives are all expected to further improve segment operating margins in future periods. Certain regulatory requirements affecting the end markets served by the Companys engine retarder business accelerated customer purchases to 2006 which will adversely impact segment sales volumes in 2007. 2005 COMPARED TO 2004 Sales in the Tools & Components segment decreased 1.0% in 2005 compared to 2004. The 2005 period sales were negatively impacted by 5.0% on a year over year basis due to the sale of a small business in late 2004 for which previously reported sales have not been restated. Sales from existing businesses contributed approximately 4.0% growth for the segment in 2005, including approximately 2.0% growth due to price increases that the Company implemented as a result of cost increases in steel and other commodities. There were no acquisitions in this segment during 2004 or 2005 and currency impacts on sales were negligible in both periods. Mechanics Hand Tools sales, representing approximately two thirds of segment sales in 2005, grew approximately 4.0% in 2005, compared with 2004. The sales growth was driven primarily by sales growth in the groups high end mobile tool distribution business which experienced low double digit growth during the year driven by increases in both the number of distributors and their average purchase levels. Mechanics Hand Tools also experienced significant growth in 2005 in the China market. The business retail mechanics hand tools business declined at low single digit levels during 2005 compared with 2004. The integration of Sears and Kmart, a major customer of the segment, tempered the business 2005 sales growth. The segments niche businesses also experienced mid single digit growth during 2005 due primarily to strength in the truck box and engine retarder businesses. Operating profit margins for the segment were 15.4% in 2005 compared to 15.2% in 2004. The improvement in operating profit margins for 2005 primarily relates to the pricing initiatives implemented to offset a portion of the steel and other commodity cost increases experienced beginning in 2004; the impact of higher sales levels and the impact of Danaher Business System cost reduction programs implemented in 2004 and 2005; and the impact of a gain recorded on the sale of real estate totaling $5.3 million ($3.9 million after taxes) during the first quarter of 2005. These improvements more than offset the incremental costs associated with 29 Table of Contents closing one of the segments manufacturing facilities. The Company incurred approximately $11 million in costs associated with this plant closure in 2005, which provided minimal benefit to operating margins in 2005. GROSS PROFIT For the Years Ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Sales $ 9,596.4 $ 7,984.7 $ 6,889.3 Cost of sales 5,353.0 4,539.7 3,996.6 Gross profit 4,243.4 $ 3,445.0 $ 2,892.7 Gross profit margin 44.2 % 43.1 % 42.0 % Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2006 benefited from leverage on increased sales volume, the on going cost improvements in existing business units driven by our Danaher Business System processes and low cost region initiatives, generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired, and cost reductions in recently acquired business units. Increases in selling prices to offset some of the increases in cost and surcharges related to steel and other commodity purchases also contributed to gross profit improvement. These improvements were partially offset by a change in mix to certain lower margin businesses including the Gilbarco Veeder Root business and sales to the United States Postal Service in the product identification business. In addition, the Company recorded a loss on a product development venture in the first quarter of 2006 and incurred higher initial product costs associated with the Sybron Dental acquisition in the second quarter of 2006, which further reduced gross margins for the year ended December 31, 2006. Higher raw material costs or any significant slowdown in the economy could adversely affect gross profit margins in future periods. Gross profit margins for 2005 improved 110 basis points to 43.1% from 42.0% in 2004. This improvement resulted primarily from generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired, leverage on increased sales volume, on going cost improvements in existing business units driven by our DBS processes and low cost region initiatives, and cost reductions in recently acquired business units. Partly offsetting these improvements were the costs associated with closing a manufacturing facility in the Tools & Components segment. OPERATING EXPENSES For the Years Ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Sales $ 9,596.4 $ 7,984.7 $ 6,889.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,741.8 2,175.8 1,795.7 SG&A as a % of sales 28.6 % 27.2 % 26.1 % The year over year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is due primarily to increases in selling, general and administrative expenses associated with recently acquired businesses (principally Leica, Sybron Dental and Vision) and their higher relative operating expense structures, additional spending to fund growth opportunities throughout the Company, and the implementation of SFAS 123R. Implementation of SFAS 123R in 2006 increased operating expenses by $55 million in 2006 and contributed a 60 basis point increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2006 compared to 2005. In addition, in 2006 the Company expensed approximately $6.5 million of in process research and development related to the Vision acquisition. The Company also recorded a $4.5 million impairment of a minority interest in a medical technologies company in the first quarter of 2006, which increased 2006 selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by approximately 5 basis points compared to 2005. These items were partially offset by increased leverage from higher sales levels in 2006. 30 Table of Contents INTEREST COSTS AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS For a description of the Companys outstanding indebtedness, please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities and Indebtedness below. Interest expense of $79.8 million in 2006 was approximately $34.9 million higher than 2005. The increase in interest expense in 2006 is primarily due to higher debt levels during the year, primarily due to borrowings incurred to fund the acquisitions of Sybron Dental and Vision. Interest expense for 2005 was lower than the prior year by approximately $10.1 million. The decrease in interest expense in 2005 compared to 2004 was due primarily to lower debt levels during the year as a result of the repayment of the Companys 6.25% Eurobond notes and to a lesser extent, lower borrowing rates on new borrowings during the period. Interest income of $8.0 million, $14.7 million and $7.6 million was recognized in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Average invested cash balances decreased during 2006 compared to 2005 due to employing cash balances to complete several acquisitions in 2005 and 2006, to finance repurchases of the Companys outstanding common stock in the second half of 2005 and to repay the previously outstanding Eurobonds in July 2005. In addition, 2005 interest income reflects the collection of $4.6 million of interest on a note receivable which had not previously been recorded due to collection risk (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). INCOME TAXES The Companys effective tax rate of 22.4% for 2006 was 4.9 percentage points lower than the effective tax rate for 2005. The Companys effective income tax rate for 2006 benefited by $69 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, as a result of the reduction of valuation allowances related to foreign tax credit carryforwards that are now expected to be realized, the favorable resolution of examinations of certain previously filed returns which resulted in the reduction of previously provided tax reserves and the impact of a change in German tax law which entitles the Company to cash payments in lieu of previously held unrecognized tax credits. These positive impacts were partially mitigated by a higher effective tax rate applicable to the second quarter 2006 gain on the sale of shares of First Technology, plc (see Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) which increased the overall provision by $1.5 million compared to what would have been incurred using the Companys overall effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for 2007 is expected to be approximately 27%. The 2005 effective tax rate of 27.3% was 2.2 percentage points lower than the 2004 effective rate, mainly due to the effect of a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2005 compared to 2004. The Company also resolved examinations of certain previously filed U.S. and international tax returns and provided additional reserves for other matters arising during the third quarter of 2005. Resolution of these matters resulted in a small benefit from the reversal of previously provided tax reserves. The Companys effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below) and changes in tax laws. The tax effect of significant unusual items or changes in tax regulations is reflected in the period in which they occur. The Companys effective tax rate for 2006 differs from the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the United States. No provisions for United States income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States. The amount of United States income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings. As of December 31, 2006, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States was approximately $3.4 billion. The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for potential tax contingencies. Based on these reviews and the result of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit, reserves are adjusted as necessary. However, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Companys estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are determined or resolved. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which the Companys earnings and or deductions are realized may differ from current estimates. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions, including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, as required. While the Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this Interpretation and guidance on its application, the Company currently estimates the adoption of FIN 48 will reduce the amount recorded by the Company for uncertain tax positions by approximately $60 to $80 million. This reduction will be recorded as an increase to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2007. 31 Table of Contents INFLATION Inflation did not significantly impact the Companys overall results of operations in either 2006 or 2005. The Company has experienced cost increases during the past two years in the costs of steel and petroleum based products, and with respect to the past year, non ferrous metals as well. The Company is passing along certain of these cost increases to customers. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Companys broad based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole. Interest Rate Risk The fair value of the Companys fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate this potential impact. Based on a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2006, the fair value of the Companys fixed rate long term debt would decrease by approximately $35 million. This methodology has certain limitations, and these hypothetical gains or losses would not be reflected in the Companys results of operations or financial condition under current accounting principles. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.1% notes due 2008 having an aggregate notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective interest rate on $100 million of these notes is the six month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. These instruments qualify as effective or perfect hedges. Other than the above noted swap arrangements, there were no material derivative financial instrument transactions during any of the periods presented. Additionally, the Company does not have significant commodity contracts or other derivatives. Exchange Rate Risk The Company has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products globally. As a result, it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States Dollar and against the currencies of other countries in which it manufactures and sells products and services. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. Dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The Eurobond Notes described below, as well as the European component of the commercial paper program which as of December 31, 2006, had outstanding borrowings equivalent to $1,446.9 million, provides a natural hedge to a portion of the Companys European net asset position. Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, interest rate swap agreements and trade accounts receivable. The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments. The Company anticipates, however, that counter parties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under these instruments. The Company places cash and temporary investments and its interest rate swap agreements with various high quality financial institutions throughout the world, and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company does not obtain collateral or other security to support these financial instruments, it does periodically evaluate the credit standing of the counter party financial institutions. In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the Companys customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate. 32 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity For the Years Ended, December 31, ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Total operating cash flows $ 1,547.3 $ 1,203.8 $ 1,033.2 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (137.7 ) (121.2 ) (115.9 ) Cash paid for acquisitions (2,656.0 ) (885.1 ) (1,591.7 ) Other sources 24.3 40.9 74.0 Net cash used in investing activities (2,769.4 ) (965.4 ) (1,633.6 ) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock 98.4 59.9 45.9 Proceeds (repayments) of borrowings, net 1,145.0 (292.2 ) (66.3 ) Dividends paid (24.6 ) (21.6 ) (17.7 ) Purchase of treasury stock (257.7 ) Net cash used in financing activities 1,218.8 (511.6 ) (38.1 ) Operating cash flow, a key source of the Companys liquidity, increased $343.5 million, or approximately 28.5% as compared to 2005. Earnings growth contributed $224.2 million to the increase in operating cash flow in 2006 compared to 2005, and non cash stock compensation expense and increases in depreciation and amortization also positively impacted cash flow. Non cash reductions of previously provided tax reserves positively impacted net earnings but adversely impacted the comparison of operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings. Operating working capital was a net source of cash flow in 2006 despite higher sales levels as overall operating working capital turns improved from the levels experienced during 2005. As of December 31, 2006, the Company held $317.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. Acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash in all periods presented. The Company acquired 11 companies and product lines during 2006 for total consideration of $2,656.0 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. Danaher financed the 2006 acquisitions of Sybron Dental and Vision primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and to a lesser extent from available cash. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately $866.8 million in borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program of which $80 million was denominated in U.S. dollars and $786.8 million was denominated in Euros (596 million). During the second quarter of 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured $1.5 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility and a separate, unsecured $700 million multicurrency revolving credit facility, both of which were available to backstop the Companys commercial paper program. The Company terminated the $700 million facility on October 11, 2006, which has the practical effect of reducing from $2.2 billion to $1.5 billion the maximum amount of commercial paper that the Company can issue under the commercial paper program. On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued 500 million ($630 million) of 4.5%, guaranteed notes due July 22, 2013, with a fixed re offer price of 99.623 (the Eurobond Notes) in a private placement outside the U.S. Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were approximately 496 million ($627 million) and were used to pay down a portion of the Companys outstanding commercial paper used to finance the Sybron Dental acquisition and for general corporate purposes. Operating Activities The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and long term basis. Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs, the timing of payments for items such as income taxes, pension funding decisions and other items impact reported cash flows. 33 Table of Contents Operating cash flow, a key source of the Companys liquidity, was approximately $1.5 billion for 2006, an increase of $343.5 million, or approximately 28.5% as compared to 2005. Earnings growth contributed $224.2 million to the increase in operating cash flow in 2006 compared to 2005. Included in earnings growth is a non cash benefit of approximately $69 million from the reduction of tax reserves and a change in German tax law which entitles the Company to cash payments in lieu of previously held unrecognized tax credits. Because this is a non cash benefit to net earnings, it adversely impacts the comparison of operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings. The Company also recorded increased stock option expense of $55 million in 2006 as required by SFAS 123R Share Based Payments. Because this expense adversely impacts net earnings but does not require the use of cash, it positively impacts the comparison of operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings. Operating cash flows during 2006 also benefited from increases in non cash depreciation and amortization charges of approximately $40 million compared to 2005. These increases in depreciation and amortization primarily related to recent acquisitions. Operating working capital, which the Company defines as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable, also contributed favorably to 2006 operating cash flow but at lower levels than in the comparable 2005 period, due primarily to less cash flow generation from accounts payable in 2006 compared to 2005. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company records appropriate accruals for the costs of closing duplicate facilities, severing redundant personnel and integrating the acquired businesses into existing Company operations. Cash flows from operating activities are reduced by the amounts expended against the various accruals established in connection with each acquisition. Investing Activities Cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions, capital expenditures and cash flows from divestitures of businesses or assets. Net cash used in investing activities was $2,769 million in 2006 compared to approximately $965 million in 2005. Gross capital spending increased $16.5 million in 2006 from 2005 levels to $137.7 million, due primarily to capital spending relating to new acquisitions, and increased spending related to investments in the Companys low cost region sourcing initiatives, new products and other growth opportunities. Capital expenditures are made primarily to support product development, for increasing capacity, replacement of equipment and improving information technology systems. Net cash used in investing activities was $965 million in 2005 compared to approximately $1.6 billion in 2004. Capital spending increased $5 million in 2005 from 2004 levels to $121 million. In 2007, the Company expects capital spending of approximately $175 to $200 million. Disposals of fixed assets yielded approximately $10 million and $19 million of cash proceeds for 2006 and 2005, respectively. As discussed below, the Company completed several business acquisitions and divestitures during 2006, 2005 and 2004. All of the acquisitions during this period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Companys financial statements. This goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect the competitive nature of the process by which the businesses are acquired and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses are expected to bring to existing operations. For a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see Notes 2 and 5 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 2006 Acquisitions In May 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sybron Dental for total consideration of approximately $2 billion, including transaction costs and net of $94 million of cash acquired, and assumed approximately $182 million of debt. Substantially all of the assumed debt was subsequently repaid or refinanced prior to December 31, 2006. Danaher financed the acquisition of shares and the refinancing of the assumed debt primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, as discussed under Financing Activities and Indebtedness below, and to a lesser extent from available cash. In addition, in the last quarter of 2006 and first quarter of 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Vision for an aggregate price of approximately $520 million, including transaction costs and net of approximately $122 million of cash acquired and assumed $1.5 million of debt. The Company financed the transaction through a combination of available cash and the issuance of commercial paper. Vision, based in Australia, manufactures and markets automated instruments, antibodies and biochemical reagents used for biopsy based detection of cancer and infectious diseases, and had revenues of approximately $86 million in its last completed fiscal year. Management believes that the pairing of Vision with the Companys existing life science instrumentation business, Leica, will significantly broaden the Companys product offerings in the growing anatomical pathology market and expand the sales and growth opportunities for both the Leica and Vision businesses. Total consideration for the other nine businesses acquired during 2006 was approximately $213 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. In general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of environmental instrumentation, medical equipment or industrial products, in the market segments of electronic test, critical care diagnostics, water quality, product identification and sensors and controls. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of either the Professional 34 Table of Contents Instrumentation, Medical Technologies or Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual sales of these nine acquired businesses were approximately $140 million at the dates of their respective acquisitions. In the first half of 2006, the Company purchased and subsequently sold shares of First Technology plc, a U.K. based public company, in connection with the Companys unsuccessful bid to acquire First Technology. First Technology also paid the Company a break up fee of approximately $3 million. During the second quarter of 2006 the Company recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $14 million ($8.9 million after tax, or approximately $0.03 per diluted share) in connection with these matters, net of related transaction costs, which is included in other expense (income), net in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Statement of Earnings. Disposals of fixed assets and land yielded approximately $10 million of cash proceeds during 2006 due to the sale of three parcels of real estate and miscellaneous equipment. Disposals of fixed assets yielded approximately $19 million of cash proceeds during 2005,primarily related to a sale of a building which generated a pre tax gain $5.3 million in 2005 which was included as a component of other expense (income), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 2005 Acquisitions In the first quarter of 2005 the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Linx Printing Technologies PLC, a publicly held U.K based coding and marking business, for $171 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired of $2 million. Linx complements the Companys product identification businesses and had annual revenue of approximately $93 million in 2004. In August 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of German based Leica Microsystems AG, for an aggregate purchase price of 210 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired of 12 million and the assumption and repayment at closing of 125 million outstanding Leica debt ($429 million in aggregate as of the date of the acquisition). The Company funded this acquisition and the repayment of debt assumed using available cash and through borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit totaling $222 million, which have subsequently been repaid. Leica complements the Companys medical technologies business and had annual revenues of approximately $540 million in 2004 (excluding the approximately $120 million of revenue attributable to the semiconductor business that has been divested, as described below). In September 2005, the Company also completed the sale of Leicas semiconductor equipment business which was held for sale at the time of the acquisition. This business had historically operated at a loss. Proceeds from the sale have been reflected as a reduction in the purchase price for Leica in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Operating losses for this business for the period from acquisition to disposition totaled approximately $1.3 million and are reflected in Other expense (income), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In addition to Linx and Leica, the Company acquired 11 smaller companies and product lines during 2005 for total consideration of $285 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. In general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of environmental or instrumentation products, in markets such as medical technologies, electronic test, sensors and controls, environmental, product identification, aerospace and defense and motion. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of either the Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies or Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregated annual sales of these 11 acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions were approximately $260 million. In June 2005, the Company divested one insignificant business that was reported as a continuing operation within the Industrial Technologies segment for aggregate proceeds of $12.1 million in cash net of related transaction expenses. Sales related to this business included in the Companys results for 2005 were $7.5 million. The Company recorded a pre tax gain of $4.6 million on the divestiture which is reported as a component of Other expense (income), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net cash proceeds received on the sale are included in Proceeds from Divestitures in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In June 2005, the Company collected $14.6 million in full payment of a retained interest that was in the form of a $10 million note receivable and an equity interest arising from the sale of a prior business. The Company had recorded this note net of applicable allowances and had not previously recognized interest income on the note due to uncertainties associated with collection of the principal balance of the note and the related interest. As a result of the collection, the Company recorded $4.6 million of interest income related to the cumulative interest received on this note in the second quarter of 2005. In addition, the Company recorded a pre tax gain of $5.3 million related to collection of the note balance in the second quarter of 2005 which has been recorded as a component of Other expense (income), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Cash proceeds from the collection of the principal balance of $10 million are included in Proceeds from Divestitures in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 35 Table of Contents 2004 Acquisitions In January 2004, the Company acquired all of the share capital of Radiometer S/A for $684 million in cash (net of $77 million in acquired cash), including transaction costs. In addition, the Company assumed $66 million of debt in connection with the acquisition. Radiometer had total annual sales of approximately $300 million at the time of acquisition. In May 2004, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Kaltenbach & Voight Gmbh (KaVo) for 350 million ($412 million) in cash, including transaction costs and net of $45 million in acquired cash. KaVo, headquartered in Biberach, Germany, with 2003 revenues of approximately $450 million, is a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and sale of dental technology, including hand pieces, treatment units and diagnostic systems and laboratory equipment. In November 2004, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Trojan Technologies, Inc. for aggregate consideration of $185 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of $23 million in acquired cash. In addition, the Company assumed $4 million of debt in connection with the acquisition. Trojan is a leader in the ultraviolet disinfection market for drinking and wastewater applications and had annual revenues of approximately $115 million at the time of acquisition. In addition to Radiometer, KaVo and Trojan, the Company acquired ten smaller companies and product lines during 2004 for total consideration of $311 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. In general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of instrumentation products, in markets such as medical technologies, electronic test, motion, environmental, product identification, sensors and controls, and aerospace and defense. These companies were all acquired to complement existing businesses within the Professional Instrumentation segment, or in connection with the establishment of the Medical Technologies segment. The aggregate annual sales of these acquired businesses as of the respective dates of acquisition were approximately $280 million. In addition, the Company sold a business that was part of the Tools & Components segment during 2004. This business was insignificant to reported sales and earnings. Proceeds from this sale have been included in proceeds from divestitures in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The pre tax gain on the sale of $1.5 million ($1.1 million after tax) is included in Other expense (income), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Recent Acquisition Developments Subsequent to December 31, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of five smaller companies and product lines for total consideration of $206 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. These companies were all acquired to complement existing businesses. Two of the businesses are manufacturers of dental imaging products and will be part of the Companys Medical Technologies segment. The other businesses complement the Companys electronic test and environmental businesses in the Professional Instrumentation segment. The aggregate annual sales of these acquired businesses as of the respective dates of acquisition were approximately $91 million. Financing Activities and Indebtedness Financing cash flows consist primarily of borrowings and repayments of indebtedness, repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of $1,219 million during 2006 compared to $512 million of cash used during the comparable period of 2005. The increase in cash generated from financing activities was primarily due to commercial paper borrowings used to finance the acquisition of Sybron Dental and Vision, and the issuance of $627 million (496 million) private placement Eurobond Notes, net of debt repayments and dividends paid during 2006. Proceeds from the Eurobond Notes were used to pay off a portion of the outstanding commercial paper and for other general corporate purposes. Total debt was $2,434 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $1,042 million at December 31, 2005. The Companys debt financing as of December 31, 2006 was comprised primarily of: $787 million of outstanding Euro denominated commercial paper; $80 million of outstanding U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper; $660 million (500 million) 4.5% guaranteed Eurobond Notes due July 22, 2013; $594 million of zero coupon Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (LYONs); $250 million of 6.1% notes due 2008 (subject to the interest rate swaps described above); and $63 million of other borrowings. The Company primarily satisfies its short term liquidity needs through issuances of U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper. Under the Companys U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs, the Company or its subsidiary may issue and sell unsecured, short term promissory notes in aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.2 billion. The Company issued $2 billion of commercial paper in May 2006 and used the proceeds principally to fund its acquisition of Sybron Dental. Subsequent to May 2006, the Company has used available cash flow and the proceeds from the Eurobond Note offering (see below) to reduce outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper programs. In November and December 2006, the Company again utilized its commercial paper program to fund the acquisition of Vision. As of December 31, 2006, $80 million remained outstanding under the U.S. dollar commercial paper program with an average interest rate of 5.34% and an average maturity of 3 days and $787 million remained outstanding under the Euro denominated commercial paper program (596 million) with an average interest rate of 3.87% and an average maturity of 64 days. 36 Table of Contents Credit support for the commercial paper programs is provided by an unsecured $1.5 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) which the Company entered into in April 2006 to replace two existing $500 million credit facilities. The Credit Facility expires on April 25, 2011, subject to a one year extension option at the request of Danaher and with the consent of the lenders. The Credit Facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest is based on either (1) a LIBOR based formula, (2) a formula based on the lenders prime rate or on the Federal funds rate, or (3) the rate of interest bid by a particular lender for a particular loan under the Credit Facility. In May 2006 the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an unsecured $700 million multicurrency revolving credit facility (the Secondary Credit Facility) on terms substantially similar to those under the Credit Facility that was also available to provide credit support for the Companys commercial paper and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Company terminated the Secondary Credit Facility on October 11, 2006, which has the practical effect of reducing from $2.2 billion to $1.5 billion the maximum amount of commercial paper that the Company can issue under the commercial paper program. The Company terminated the Secondary Credit Facility because Company management believes that the $1.5 billion facility provides sufficient backstop for amounts that the Company believes will be issued under the commercial paper facility in the foreseeable future, that additional credit would be available if the Company were to decide to issue more than $1.5 billion of commercial paper or otherwise need additional credit, and that termination of the $700 million facility eliminates unnecessary fees. There were no borrowings under either the Credit Facility or the Secondary Credit Facility, or either of the terminated credit facilities, during 2006. On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued the Eurobond Notes in a private placement outside the U.S. Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were 496 million ($627 million) and have been used to pay down a portion of the Companys outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. In 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Holders of the LYONs may convert each of their LYONs into 14.5352 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 12.0 million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2006, the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was $49 per share, which, at that date, was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may offer to redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and or Company common stock, at the Companys option, on January 22, 2011. The holders had a similar option to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of January 22, 2004, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of $1.1 million being redeemed by the Company for cash. Under the terms of the LYONs, the Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month period commencing after January 22, 2004 if the average market price of a LYON for a measurement period preceding such six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The amount of contingent interest to be paid is equal to the higher of either 0.0315% percent of the bonds market value measured by its five day trading average price preceeding the record date or the equivalent common stock dividend. Contingent interest of approximately $0.5 million is payable for the six month period from July 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity. During the first quarter of 2006, the Company borrowed $120 million under uncommitted lines of credit in connection with the investment in the shares of First Technology noted above and other matters. These borrowings, along with all borrowings incurred in 2005 under uncommitted lines of credit associated with the purchase of Leica, which totaled $177 million as of December 31, 2005, were fully repaid in the first quarter of 2006. The $250 million of 6.1% notes due 2008 were issued in October 1998 at an interest cost of 6.1%. The fair value of the 2008 notes, after taking into account the interest rate swaps discussed below, is approximately $252 million at December 31, 2006. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the notes having an aggregate notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective net interest rate on $100 million of the Notes is the six month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. Rates are reset twice per year. At December 31, 2006, the net interest rate on $100 million of the notes was 5.8% after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreement. In accordance with SFAS No. 133 (Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended), the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. These instruments qualify as effective or perfect hedges. On April 21, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of the Companys common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no expiration date for the Companys repurchase program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Companys management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Companys 1998 Stock Option Plan (or any successor plan) and for other corporate purposes. 37 Table of Contents During 2005, the Company repurchased approximately 5 million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions at an aggregate cost of $257.7 million. The repurchases were funded from available cash and from borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit. There were no share repurchases under this program in 2006 and at December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately 5 million shares remaining for stock repurchases under the existing Board authorization. The Company expects to fund any further repurchases using the Companys available cash balances or existing lines of credit. The Company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt. However, a downgrade in the Companys credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Companys commercial paper program and credit facilities, and could limit, or in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude the Companys ability to issue commercial paper. The Companys outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Companys operations and as of December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. To benefit from the SEC Securities Offering Reform rules applicable to well known seasoned issuers, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC in July 2006, which became effective automatically, to register an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. No securities have been issued off this shelf registration statement. The new registration statement replaced the Companys prior, $1 billion shelf registration statement. The Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share payable on January 26, 2007 to holders of record on December 29, 2006. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2006 were $24.6 million. Cash and Cash Requirements As of December 31, 2006, the Company held $318 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, fund its pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, using borrowings under existing commercial paper programs or credit facilities or by accessing the capital markets as needed for liquidity. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy both short term and long term requirements. The Companys cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside the United States. The Company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Wherever possible, cash management is centralized and inter company financing is used to provide working capital to our operations. Most of the cash balances held outside the United States could be repatriated to the United States, but, under current law, would potentially be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient inter company transfer of funds, the Companys intent is that cash balances would remain in the foreign country and it would meet United States liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. Pension and Other Post Retirement & Employee Benefit Plans Due to previous equity market declines the fair value of the Companys pension fund assets has decreased below the accumulated benefit obligation due to the participants in the U.S. plan. In addition, certain non U.S. plans are not fully funded. As a result, in accordance with SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R), the Company has recorded unrecognized losses and prior service costs of $151.9 million ($99.2 million net of tax benefits) cumulatively through December 31, 2006. The unrecognized losses and prior service costs, net, is calculated as the difference between the actuarially determined accumulated benefit obligation and the value of the plan assets as of September 30, 2006. This adjustment results in a direct reduction of stockholders equity and does not immediately impact net earnings. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158). For a summary of the material provisions of SFAS No. 158, see New Accounting Standards. The application of FAS 158 in 2006 decreased the Companys minimum pension liability by $13.0 million ($9.1 million net of tax benefits) due to the recognition of previously unrecognized, over funded positions in certain of the Companys non US pension plans. The Company also recorded other comprehensive income of $10 million ($6.5 million net of tax benefits) due to the recognition of actuarially determined prior service credits associated with the Companys U.S. based retiree benefit program. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in such calculations. These assumptions include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of salary increases, health care cost trend 38 Table of Contents rates, mortality rates, and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. For the United States plan, the Company used a 5.75% discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at December 31, 2006, which represents an increase of 0.25% in the discount rate from December 31, 2005. For non U.S. plans, rates appropriate for each plan are determined based on investment grade instruments with maturities approximately equal to the average expected benefit payout under the plan. A further 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate used for the plans would have increased the minimum pension liability $20 million ($13 million on an after tax basis) from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2006. For 2006, the expected long term rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the United States plan was estimated at 8.0% which is the same as the rate used in 2005. This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. The U.S. plan invests between 60% to 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities. The balance of the asset portfolio is invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds. Pension expense for the U.S. plan for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $17 million (or $11 million on an after tax basis), compared with $8.1 million (or $5.9 million on an after tax basis) for this plan in 2005. If the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by 0.5%, pension expense for 2006 would have increased $1.6 million (or $1.0 million on an after tax basis). The Company made no contributions to the U.S. plan in 2006 and is not statutorily required to make contributions to the plan in 2007. The Companys non U.S. plan assets are comprised of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. The estimated long term rate of return for the non U.S. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 2.5% to 6.5% for 2006. The U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006 was enacted August 17, 2006. While the Act will have some effect on specific plan provisions in our retirement program, its primary effect will be to change the minimum funding requirements for plan years beginning in 2008. Based on initial projections, the Act is expected to slightly increase the amount of our required contributions. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 under (1) long term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long term liabilities reflected on the Companys balance sheet under GAAP.

Interest on long term debt and capital lease obligations is reflected in a separate line in the table. 39 Table of Contents (c) As described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (d) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. (e) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self insurance and litigation claims, post retirement benefits, certain pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations are based upon managements estimates over the terms of these agreements and are largely based upon historical experience. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of off balance sheet commercial commitments of the Company. Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than One Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5 Years ($ in millions) Standby Letters of Credit and Performance Bonds $ 165.5 $ 82.5 $ 37.2 $ 30.4 $ 15.4 Guarantees 49.7 38.7 2.9 0.3 7.8 Obligations for Vision Systems shares not yet acquired at December 31, 2006 72.7 72.7 Contingent Acquisition Consideration 41.9 5.1 36.8 Total $ 329.8 $ 199.0 $ 76.9 $ 30.7 $ 23.2 Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the Companys obligations under short term contracts to purchase raw materials and components for manufacture and for performance under specific manufacturing agreements. Guarantees are generally issued in connection with certain transactions with vendors, suppliers and financing entities. In connection with three past acquisitions, the Company has entered into agreements with the respective sellers to pay certain amounts in the future as additional purchase price. The Company enters into these types of arrangements to help bridge differences of opinion that the Company and the sellers may have over the appropriate value of the acquired business. The Company could pay nothing in the aggregate over the next three years pursuant to these agreements, or a maximum of up to $41.9 million over the next three years depending on the future performance of the respective businesses. In connection with acquisitions completed subsequent to December 31, 2006, the Company entered into similar agreements with the respective sellers to pay additional purchase price of up to $2.4 million over the next 2 years if certain performance criteria are achieved. The Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. The Company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Due to the Companys downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 40 Table of Contents Except as described above, as of December 31, 2006 the Company has not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and has no unconsolidated special purpose entities. Legal Proceedings Please refer to Notes 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding certain outstanding litigation matters. In addition to the litigation noted under Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental, Health & Safety, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Companys products, claims relating to intellectual property matters and claims involving employment matters and commercial disputes. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages. While the Company maintains workers compensation, property, cargo, automobile, crime, fiduciary, product, general liability, and directors and officers liability insurance (and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) that it believes cover a portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect the Company against potential loss exposures. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to protect the Company against potential loss exposures. The Company believes that the results of these litigation matters and other pending legal proceedings will not have a materially adverse effect on its cash flows or financial condition, even before taking into account any related insurance or indemnification recoveries. The Company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. The Company carries significant deductibles and self insured retentions under our insurance policies, and management believes that the Company maintains adequate accruals to cover the retained liability. Management determines the Companys accrual for self insurance liability based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The Companys Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage. For a discussion of additional risks related to existing and potential legal proceedings, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Managements discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect managements more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to make required payments. The Company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts. Estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of the Companys customers, and the Company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, the Company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances, which could adversely impact the Companys net earnings and financial condition. Inventories. The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Companys markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the Companys control. As a result, such fluctuations can be difficult to predict. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company would be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Companys net earnings and financial condition. 41 Table of Contents Acquired intangibles. The Companys business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur. The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, the accounting standard for goodwill, which requires that the Company, on an annual basis, calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. Impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. If actual fair value is less than the Companys estimates, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. The Companys annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of the Companys reporting units as of September 30, 2006, the annual testing date, ranged from approximately $3 million to approximately $1.7 billion. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 10% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $1.5 billion for each of the Companys reporting units. Long lived assets. The Company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Judgments made by the Company relate to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets and are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long lived assets, there is risk that the carrying value of the Companys long lived assets may require adjustment in future periods. If actual fair value is less than the Companys estimates, long lived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. Purchase accounting. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination, the Company accrues estimates for certain of the integration costs anticipated at the date of acquisition, including personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings. Adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized. The Company establishes these accruals based on information obtained during the due diligence process, the Companys experience in acquiring other companies, and information obtained after the closing about the acquired companys business, assets and liabilities. The accruals established by the Company are inherently uncertain because they are based on limited information on the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as the uncertainty of the cost to execute the integration plans for the business. If the accruals established by the Company are insufficient to account for all of the activities required to integrate the acquired entity, the Company would be required to incur an expense, which would adversely affect the Companys results of operations. To the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose, the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price, typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances. Risk Insurance. The Company carries significant deductibles and self insured retentions with respect to various business risks. The business risk areas involving the most significant accounting estimates are workers compensation and product liability. For domestic workers compensation and product liability risk, the Company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses (stop loss insurance) and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the self insured retention. These reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims. The specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified by third party administrator specialists for workers compensation and by outside risk insurance experts for product liability. In addition, outside risk experts recommend reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims by evaluating the Companys specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends among statistical and other factors. The Company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of December 31, 2006 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate. Environmental. The Company has made a provision for environmental remediation and environmental related personal injury claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company generally makes an assessment of the costs involved for its remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as its prior experience with similar sites. If the Company determines that it has potential remediation liability for properties currently owned or previously sold, it accrues the total estimated costs, including investigation and remediation costs, associated with the site. The Company also estimates its exposure for environmental related personal injury claims and accrues for this estimated liability as such claims become known. While the Company actively pursues appropriate insurance recoveries as well as appropriate recoveries from other potentially responsible 42 Table of Contents parties, it does not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of the Companys involvement in certain sites, uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the availability of alternative cleanup methods, variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations. As such, there can be no assurance that the Companys estimates of environmental liabilities will not change. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingent Liabilities. The Company is, from time to time, subject to routine litigation incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Companys products, allegations of patent and trademark infringement and trade secret misappropriation, and litigation and administrative proceedings involving employment matters and commercial disputes. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages. The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and if appropriate recognizes a liability for these contingencies with the assistance of legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments or changes in the Companys settlement strategy. For a discussion of these contingencies, including managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities, refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). This statement requires a company to (a) recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plans over funded status or a liability for a plans under funded status (b) measure a plans assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year, and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur (reported in comprehensive income). The requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. The requirement to measure the plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal yearend statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The adoption of this standard reduced the amount of pension and other post retirement liabilities recorded by approximately $23 million as of December 31, 2006 due to the recognition of previously unrecognized, over funded positions in certain of the Companys non US pension plans and due to the recognition of actuarially determined prior service credits associated with the Companys U.S. based retiree benefit program. The Company expects to change its pension plan measurement date to December 31 effective in 2008. See Pension and Other Post Retirement & Employee Benefit Plans above and Notes 8 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 was effective in the Companys first quarter of 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 did not have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted statements of financial accounting standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123 R), which requires the company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards. See Note 14 for further discussion. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions, including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, as required. While the Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this Interpretation and guidance on its application, the Company currently estimates the adoption of FIN 48 will reduce the amount recorded by the Company for uncertain tax positions by approximately $60 to $80 million. This reduction will be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2007. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.
