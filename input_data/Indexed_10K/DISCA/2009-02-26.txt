Introduction Managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. This discussion is organized as follows: Overview. This section provides a general description of our business segments, as well as recent developments we believe are important in understanding the results of operations and financial condition, including a discussion of the Newhouse Transaction. Results of Operations 2008 vs. 2007. This section provides an analysis of our result of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. In order to assist the reader in better understanding our operations, a table is provided that reconciles our and DHCs prior year income statements presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) to the financial information discussed in our adjusted results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. This analysis is presented on both a consolidated and a business segment basis. Results of Operations 2007 vs. 2006. This section provides an analysis of DHCs prior year income statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, restated to reflect AMC as a discontinued operation, as a result of the completion of the Newhouse Transaction Liquidity and Capital Resources. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2008, as well as a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments that existed as of December 31, 2008. Included in the analysis of outstanding debt is a discussion of the amount of financial capacity available to fund our future commitments, as well as other financing arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies. This section identifies those accounting policies that are considered important to our results of operations and financial condition, require significant judgment and require estimates on the part of management in application. All of our significant accounting policies, including those considered critical accounting policies, are also summarized in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 37 Table of Contents Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. This section discusses how we manage exposure to potential gains and losses arising from changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and changes in the market value of financial instruments. Overview We are a leading global media and entertainment company that provides original and purchased programming across multiple distribution platforms in the United States and approximately 170 other countries, including television networks offering customized programming in 35 languages. Our strategy is to optimize the distribution, ratings and profit potential of each of our branded channels. We own and operate a diversified portfolio of website properties and other digital services and develop and sell consumer and educational products and media sound services in the United States and internationally. We operate through three divisions: (1) U.S. Networks, (2) International Networks, and (3) Commerce, Education, and Other. Our media content is designed to target key audience demographics and the popularity of our programming creates a reason for advertisers to purchase commercial time on our channels. Audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators, direct to home or DTH satellite operators and other content distributors to deliver our programming to their customers. The current economic conditions, and any continuation of these adverse conditions, may adversely affect the economic prospects of advertisers and could alter their current spending priorities. In addition to growing distribution and advertising revenue for our branded channels, we are focused on growing revenue across new distribution platforms, including brand aligned web properties, mobile devices, video on demand and broadband channels, which serve as additional outlets for advertising and affiliate sales, and provide promotional platforms for our programming. We also operate internet sites, such as HowStuffWorks.com, providing supplemental news, information and entertainment content that are aligned with our television programming. We will continue to incur incremental legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We will incur costs associated with public company reporting requirements and costs associated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. We are incurring additional costs to prepare for the management attestation requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and the related attestation by the independent registered public accounting firm to which we will first be subject in 2009. U.S. Networks U.S. Networks is our largest division, which owns and operates 11 cable and satellite channels, including Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet, as well as a portfolio of website properties and other digital services. U.S. Networks also provides distribution and advertising sales services for Travel Channel and distribution services for BBC America and BBC World News. U.S. Networks derives revenue primarily from distribution fees and advertising sales, which comprised 45% and 51%, respectively, of revenue for this division for the year ended December 31, 2008. During each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet collectively generated more than 73% of U.S. Networks total revenue. U.S. Networks earns distribution fees under multi year affiliation agreements with cable operators, DTH operators and other distributors of television programming. Distribution fees are based on the number of subscribers receiving programming. Upon the launch of a new channel, we may initially pay distributors to carry such channel (such payments are referred to as launch incentives), or may provide the channel to the distributor for free for a predetermined length of time. Launch incentives are amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction of revenue over the term of the affiliation agreement. U.S. Networks sells commercial time on our networks and websites. The number of subscribers to our channels, the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels are key drivers of advertising revenue. Several of our domestic networks, including Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet, are currently distributed to substantially all of the cable television and direct broadcast satellite homes in the U.S. 38 Table of Contents Accordingly, the rate of growth in U.S. distribution revenue in future periods is expected to be less than historical rates. Our other U.S. Networks are distributed primarily on the digital tier of cable systems and equivalent tiers on DTH platforms and have been successful in maximizing their distribution within this more limited universe. There is, however, no guarantee that these digital networks will ever be able to gain the distribution levels or advertising rates of our major networks. Our contractual arrangements with U.S. distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. In 2008, we renewed the distribution agreements with one of our largest distributors. U.S. Networks largest single cost is the cost of programming, including production costs for original programming. U.S. Networks amortizes the cost of original or purchased programming based on the expected realization of revenue resulting in an accelerated amortization for Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet and straight line amortization over three to five years for the remaining networks. International Networks International Networks manages a portfolio of channels, led by the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet brands that are distributed in virtually every pay television market in the world through an infrastructure that includes major operational centers in London, Singapore, New Delhi and Miami. International Networks regional operations cover most major markets including the U.K., Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia, Latin America and India. International Networks currently operates over 100 unique distribution feeds in 35 languages with channel feeds customized according to language needs and advertising sales opportunities. Most of the divisions channels are wholly owned by us with the exception of (1) the international Animal Planet channels, which are generally joint ventures in which the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) owns 50%, (2) People + Arts, which operates in Latin America and Iberia as a 50 50 joint venture with the BBC and (3) several channels in Japan, Canada and Poland, which operate as joint ventures with strategically important local partners. Similar to U.S. Networks, the primary sources of revenue for International Networks are distribution fees and advertising sales, and the primary cost is programming. International Networks executes a localization strategy by offering high quality shared programming with U.S. Networks, customized content, and localized schedules via our distribution feeds. Distribution revenue represents approximately 62% of the divisions operating revenue and continues to deliver growth in markets with the highest potential for pay television expansion. Advertising sales are increasingly important to the divisions financial success. International television markets vary in their stages of development. Some, notably the U.K., are among the more advanced digital multi channel television markets in the world, while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital. We believe there is growth in many international markets including Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe that are in the early stage of pay TV evolution. In developing pay TV markets, we expect to see advertising revenue growth from subscriber growth, our localization strategy, and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay TV. In relatively mature markets, such as the U.K., the growth dynamic is changing. Increased penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid growth in those markets. Instead, growth in advertising sales will come from increasing viewership and advertising pricing on our existing pay TV networks and launching new services, either in pay TV or free television environments. One such new launch came in early 2006 when the Company acquired a broadly distributed free to air cable channel in Germany and relaunched it as DMAX. Another launch will come in 2009, when we will launch a digital terrestrial channel in the U.K. on the free platform known as Freeview, which now has over 10 million homes. Neither of these channels generate distribution fees, but both are broadly distributed enough to have strong advertising sales potential. Our international businesses are subject to a number of risks including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, regulatory issues, and political instability. Changes in any of these areas could adversely affect the performance of the International Networks. International Networks priorities include maintaining a leadership position in nonfiction and certain fictional entertainment in international markets and continuing to grow and improve the performance of the 39 Table of Contents international operations. These priorities will be achieved through expanding local advertising sales capabilities, creating licensing and digital growth opportunities, and improving operating efficiencies by strengthening programming and promotional collaboration between U.S. and International Network groups. Commerce, Education, and Other During 2007, DCH evaluated its commerce business and made the decision to transition from running brick and mortar retail locations to leveraging its products through retail arrangements and an e commerce and catalog platform. In the third quarter of 2007, DCH completed the closing of its 103 mall based and stand alone Discovery Channel stores. As a result of the store closures, our as adjusted results of operations have been prepared to reflect the retail store business as discontinued operations. Accordingly, the revenue, costs and expenses of the retail store business have been excluded from the respective captions in our financial statements and have been reported as discontinued operations. In February 2009, we announced our plan to transition our commerce business to a royalty model, thereby providing for growth in profitability and reducing the financial risk of holding significant product inventories. As such, we will outsource the commerce direct to consumer operations including our commerce website, related marketing, product development and fulfillment to a third party in exchange for royalties. We expect to complete the transition in the second quarter of 2009. Our new structure for our commerce business will enable us to continue offering high quality Discovery Blu Ray and standard definition DVD programming as well as many merchandise categories leveraging both licensed and make and sell products. Although we expect this new structure to facilitate growth in operating income, we expect an initial compression in top line revenue contribution, as well as a reduction in direct operating expenses in 2009. Commerce will continue to grow our established brand and home video licensing businesses to further expand our national presence in key retailers. Our commerce operations continue to add value to our television assets by reinforcing consumer loyalty and creating opportunities for our advertising and distribution partners. Our education business will continue to focus on our direct to school streaming distribution subscription services as well as our benchmark student assessment services, publishing and distributing hardcopy content through a network of distribution channels including online, catalog and dealers. Our education business also participates in a growing sponsorship and global brand and content licensing business. With the completion of the Newhouse Transaction, the operating results of the Creative Sound Services (CSS) businesses, which provide sound, music, mixing sound effects and other related services under brand names such as Sound One, POP Sound, Soundelux and Todd A O, are reported in the Commerce, Education, and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Newhouse Transaction On September 17, 2008, we were formed as a result of DHC and Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership (Advance/Newhouse) combining their respective interests in Discovery and exchanging those interests with the Company (the Newhouse Transaction). The Newhouse Transaction provided, among other things, for the combination of DHCs 662/3% interest with Advance/Newhouses 331/3% interest in DCH. The Newhouse Transaction was completed as follows: On September 17, 2008, DHC completed the spin off to its shareholders of Ascent Media Corporation (AMC), a subsidiary holding cash and all of the businesses of its wholly owned subsidiaries except for CSS (which businesses remained with us following the completion of the Newhouse Transaction) (the AMC spin off); On September 17, 2008, immediately following the AMC spin off, DHC merged with a transitory merger subsidiary of the Company, and DHCs existing shareholders received common stock of the Company; and On September 17, 2008, immediately following the DHC exchange of shares for ours, Advance/Newhouse contributed its interests in us and Animal Planet to us in exchange for shares of our Series A 40 Table of Contents and Series C convertible preferred stock that are convertible at any time into our common stock, which at the transaction date represented one third of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result of the Newhouse Transaction, we became the successor reporting entity to DHC under the Exchange Act. Because Advance/Newhouse was a one third owner of Discovery prior to the completion of the Newhouse Transaction and is a one third owner of us immediately following completion of the Newhouse Transaction, there was no effective change in ownership. Our convertible preferred stock does not have any special dividend rights and only a de minimis liquidation preference. Additionally, Advance/Newhouse retains significant participatory special class voting rights with respect to certain matters that could be submitted to stockholder vote. Pursuant to FASB Technical Bulletin 85 5, Issues Relating to Accounting for Business Combinations, for accounting purposes the Newhouse Transaction was treated as a non substantive merger, and therefore, the Newhouse Transaction was recorded at the investors historical basis. For financial reporting purposes, we are the successor reporting entity to DHC. Because there is no effective change in ownership, in accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, paragraph 11, both DHC and DCH will be consolidated in our financial statements as if the transaction had occurred January 1, 2008. The presentation of the DCH financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP includes the results of DCHs operations as an equity method investment for the period prior to January 1, 2008. For purposes of analyzing DCHs business in this managements discussion and analysis, we have presented our consolidated operating results for 2008 consistent with our financial statement presentation, while the 2007 results have been presented as if the Newhouse Transaction occurred on January 1, 2007. The following table summarizes the defined terms concerning the various Discovery entities included in this analysis: Entity Reference Discovery Communications, Inc. (post Newhouse Transaction) The Company, Discovery, we, or us Discovery Communications Holding, LLC DCH Discovery Holding Company DHC Ascent Media Corporation AMC Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership Advance/Newhouse Creative Sound Services CSS Discovery Restructuring and Travel Channel Disposition On May 14, 2007, Cox Communications Holdings, Inc. exchanged its 25% ownership interest in DCH for all of the capital stock of a subsidiary of DCH that held the Travel Channel and travelchannel.com and approximately $1.3 billion in cash. The result was an increase in DHCs proportional ownership of DCH from 50% to 662/3%. Consequently, DHCs 2007 earnings in equity interests of DCH reflect the change in ownership. Results of Operations 2008 vs. 2007 The following discussion of our results of operations is presented in three parts to assist the reader in better understanding our operations. The table below reconciles our and DHCs prior year income statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP to the financial information discussed in our adjusted results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. The second section is an overall discussion of our consolidated operating results. The third section includes a more detailed discussion of revenue and expense activity of our three operating divisions: U.S. Networks, International Networks, and Commerce, Education, and Other. 41 Table of Contents The following table represents the year ended December 31, 2007 on an as adjusted basis: For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Less: Add: Minority DHC(A) DCH Interest Discovery Historical Historical Adjustment As Adjusted (Amounts in millions, except per share amounts) Revenues: Distribution $ $ 1,477 $ $ 1,477 Advertising 1,345 1,345 Other 76 305 381 Total revenues 76 3,127 3,203 Operating costs and expenses: Cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization listed below 60 1,167 1,227 Selling, general and administrative 22 1,296 1,318 Depreciation and amortization 3 131 134 Asset impairments 26 26 Exit and restructuring charges 20 20 Gains on asset and business dispositions (1 ) (135 ) (136 ) Total operating costs and expenses 84 2,505 2,589 Operating (loss) income (8 ) 622 614 Other income (expense): Equity in earnings of Discovery Communications Holding, LLC 142 (142 )(B) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 9 9 Interest expense, net (249 ) (249 ) Other, net 8 (10 ) (2 ) Total other income (expense), net 150 (250 ) (142 ) (242 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests 142 372 (142 ) 372 Provision for income taxes (56 ) (77 ) (133 ) Minority interests, net of tax (8 ) (80 )(C) (88 ) Income from continuing operations 86 287 (222 ) 151 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (154 ) (65 ) (219 ) Net (loss) income $ (68 ) $ 222 $ (222 ) $ (68 ) Income per share from continuing operations, basic and diluted $ 0.31 $ 0.54 Loss per share from discontinued operations, basic and diluted $ (0.55 ) $ (0.78 ) Net loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.24 ) $ (0.24 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding, basic and diluted 281 281 (A) DHC results of operations represent DHC corporate costs and the results of CSS, while the results of AMC are included in net loss from discontinued operations.

Our consolidated revenue increased $240 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007. Distribution revenue increased $163 million during the year primarily due to International Networks subscriber growth combined with annual contract increases for the fully distributed U.S. Networks, offset by the disposition of Travel Channel. Advertising revenue increased $51 million for the period, and is primarily attributed to higher pricing and cash sellout rates in U.S. Networks. Other revenue increased $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007, primarily due to an increase in licensing revenue in the International Networks, increase in sales of the Planet Earth DVD through a joint venture, and increases in revenue from our representation of the Travel Channel through our U.S. Networks segment, offset by a decline in revenue from the direct to consumer business in our Commerce, Education, and Other business segment. Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue, which includes content amortization and other production related expenses in addition to distribution and merchandising costs, decreased $203 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared to 2007. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to the effect of content impairment charges in the fourth quarter 2007 of $139 million primarily in U.S. Networks coupled with a $76 million decrease in related amortization expense. These decreases were partially offset by increases in costs of revenue in the International Networks and content impairment related to TLC. Selling, general administrative. Selling, general administrative expenses, which include certain personnel, marketing and other general and administrative expenses, decreased $203 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 2007, primarily attributable to a $210 million decrease in expenses arising from long term incentive plans, which were partially offset by slight increases in costs incurred in conjunction with DCH preparing to become a consolidated subsidiary of ours as a result of the Newhouse Transaction and an increase in personnel costs in International Networks. Expenses arising from long term incentive plans are largely related to DCHs unit based, long term incentive plan, the Discovery Appreciation Plan or the DAP, or LTIP, which was modified to reflect our capital structure following the Newhouse Transaction. Prior to the Newhouse Transaction, the value of units in the LTIP was indexed to the value of DHC Series A common stock. After the Newhouse Transaction, the units remained outstanding and were converted at the effective time of the Newhouse Transaction to track changes in the value of our Series A common stock. The change in unit value of LTIP awards outstanding is recorded as expenses arising from long term incentive plans over the period outstanding. Primarily due to the decrease in both the DHC Series A common stock and our Series A common stock price during the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a benefit of $69 million to expenses arising from long term incentive plans in 2008 compared to expenses arising from long term incentive plans of $141 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. In the fourth quarter 2008, eligible new hires and promoted employees received stock options that vest in four equal installments, and those employees with LTIP units that vest between September 18, 2008 and March 14, 2009 will receive cash settled stock appreciation awards that expire in March 2010. We do not intend to make additional cash settled stock appreciation awards, except as may be required by contract or to employees in countries where stock option awards are not permitted. Depreciation and amortization. The increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2008 is due to an increase in intangible assets resulting from the reclassification of DHC intangibles following the Newhouse Transaction and the HowStuffWorks.com acquisition. Asset impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a write off of intangible assets of $30 million related to our HowStuffWorks.com business. This write off of intangible assets was due to the decline in the cash flows projected to be generated by the HowStuffWorks.com business. During the second quarter of 2007, DCH recorded an asset impairment of $26 million which represents write offs of intangible assets related to the education business . Exit and restructuring costs. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $31 million in restructuring charges, of which $11 million relates to the relocation and severance costs related to TLCs repositioning strategy, $6 million for the termination of a production group, and $6 million due to the closure of our commerce distribution center and our store headquarters offices along with the transition of the remaining commerce distribution services to third party service providers. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded restructuring charges of $20 million related to a number of organizational and strategic adjustments. The purpose of these adjustments was to better align our organizational structure with our new strategic priorities and to respond to continuing changes within the media industry. 44 Table of Contents Gain on disposition of a business. In 2007, we exchanged the capital stock of a subsidiary that held the Travel Channel and travelchannel.com (collectively, the Travel Business) for Cox Communications Holdings, Inc.s 25% ownership interest in us and $1.3 billion in cash. The distribution of the Travel Business, which was valued at $575 million, resulted in a $135 million tax free gain. Equity in (loss) income of unconsolidated affiliates. Equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates in 2008 consisted primarily of a $57 million other than temporary decline in the value of our equity method investment in HSWi, coupled with $13 million in equity losses recorded during 2008, which is offset by equity in income from our joint ventures in Canada and Japan. In 2007, we recognized $9 million of equity in income primarily from our joint ventures in Canada and Japan. Interest expense, net. On May 14, 2007, we entered into a $1.5 billion term loan in conjunction with the transaction with Cox Communications Holdings, Inc., offset by a $180 million payment for a senior note that matured. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007 is primarily a result of the term loan. Other, net. Other, net includes our other non operating income net of non operating expenses, as well as, unrealized losses from derivative instruments. Other non operating income consisted of a $47 million reduction of a liability related to the value of shares in HSWi to be exchanged to its former shareholders, which was recorded in December 2008. Offsetting this non operating income is unrealized losses from derivative transactions. Unrealized losses from derivative transactions relate primarily to our use of derivative instruments to modify our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our debt. These instruments include a combination of swaps, caps, collars and other structured instruments. As a result of unrealized mark to market adjustments, we recognized unrealized losses of $31 million and $9 million during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The foreign exchange hedging instruments used by us are spot, forward and option contracts. Additionally, we enter into non designated forward contracts to hedge non dollar denominated cash flows and foreign currency balances. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a more detailed discussion of our hedging activities. Income tax expense. Our effective tax rate was 47% and 36% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 differed from the federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to DHCs recognition of deferred tax expense related to its investment in DCH (net of tax benefit from intangible amortization related to the spin off of the Travel Channel in 2007), which is partially offset by the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of Ascent Media Sound, Inc. Other items impacting the effective tax rate include the following: our conversion from deducting foreign taxes to claiming foreign tax credits, foreign unrecognized tax positions, and other miscellaneous items. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 was not materially different than the federal income tax rate of 35%. However, during this period we benefited from the tax free treatment of the gain recognized on the disposition of the Travel Channel and the release of Travel Channel deferred tax liabilities, offset by the tax impact of discontinued operations. Minority interests, net of tax. Minority interests primarily represent our and consolidated entities portion of earnings which are allocable to the minority partners, as well as the increases and decreases in the estimated redemption value of redeemable interests in subsidiaries. The increase in minority interest during the year ended December 31, 2008 is primarily a result of our increased profits allocated to minority partners prior to the Newhouse Transaction and reporting of our financial results in accordance with ARB 51. 45 Table of Contents Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes. Summarized financial information included in discontinued operations is as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2008 As Adjusted % Change (Amounts in millions) Revenues from discontinued operations: Retail stores $ $ 58 % AMC 484 631 24 % Loss from the operations of discontinued operations before income taxes: Retail $ (99 ) % AMC (6 ) (151 ) 96 % Gains on dispositions: Retail $ % AMC 67 % Income (loss) from discontinued operations: Retail $ (99 ) % AMC 61 (151 ) NM Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax: Retail $ $ (65 ) % AMC 43 (154 ) NM On September 17, 2008, as part of the Newhouse Transaction, DHC completed the spin off to its shareholders of AMC, a subsidiary holding the cash and businesses of DHC, except for CSS, which provides sound, music, mixing, sound effects and other related services under brand names such as Sound One, POP Sound, Soundelux and Todd A O (which businesses remained with us following the completion of the Newhouse Transaction). The AMC spin off was structured such that there was no gain or loss related to the transaction. Just prior to the Newhouse Transaction, DHC sold its ownership interests in Ascent Media CANS, LLC (d/b/a AccentHealth) to AccentHealth Holdings LLC, an unaffiliated third party, for approximately $119 million in cash. It was determined that AccentHealth was a non core asset, and the sale of AccentHealth was consistent with DHCs strategy to divest non core assets. DHC recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $64 million in connection with the sale of AccentHealth, which is recorded as a component of discontinued operations. As there is no continuing involvement in the operations of AMC or AccentHealth, the financial results of their operations have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (FAS 144). 46 Table of Contents Operating Division Results As noted above, our operations are divided into three segments: U.S. Networks, International Networks and Commerce, Education, and Other. Corporate expenses primarily consist of corporate functions, executive management and administrative support services. Corporate expenses are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate business segment performance based upon decisions made directly by business segment executives. Operating results exclude LTIP expense, restructuring amounts, impairments, and operating gains, consistent with our segment reporting. See Note 24.

Accordingly, DCHs 2007 results of operations do not include Travel Channel after May 14, 2007. The disposal of Travel Channel does not meet the requirements for discontinued operations presentation. The following table represents U.S. Networks results of operations excluding Travel Channel for all periods. Although this presentation is not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe this presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the U.S. Networks results of operations and allows the reader to better understand the U.S. Networks ongoing operations. 47 Table of Contents U.S. Networks without Travel Channel Years Ended December 31, 2007 2008 As Adjusted % Change (Amounts in millions) Revenues: Distribution $ 927 $ 840 10 % Advertising 1,058 975 9 % Other 77 64 20 % Total revenues $ 2,062 $ 1,879 10 % Operating costs and expenses: Cost of revenues $ 509 $ 673 (24 )% Selling, general and administrative 476 447 6 % Total operating costs and expenses $ 985 $ 1,120 (12 )% Since the disposal of Travel Channel in 2007 did not meet the requirements of discontinued operations presentation, and the results of Travel Channel are not consolidated with DCH post transaction, the following discussion excludes the results of Travel Channel for all periods so as to facilitate comparability of the U.S. Networks segment data. Revenue. Total revenue increased $183 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007. Distribution revenue increased $87 million over the period, driven by annual contractual rate increases for fully distributed networks combined with subscription units, principally from networks carried on the digital tier. Distribution revenue includes a one time $8 million adjustment resulting from improvements in our methodology of estimating accrued revenue for certain distribution operators. The adjustment was recorded in its entirety in the second quarter of 2008 and is not material to the current or prior periods. Contra revenue items included in distribution revenue, such as launch amortization and marketing consideration, decreased $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007. This decrease includes $3 million for replacement decoder boxes to support the digitization of an analog transponder recorded as contra revenue in the second quarter of 2007. Advertising revenue increased $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher pricing in the up front and scatter markets, as well as higher cash sellouts, which were partially offset by under delivery of committed audience levels, when compared with the corresponding prior year periods. Other revenue increased $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily from our representation of the Travel Channel, which increased $11 million during the period, coupled with an increase of $5 million in revenue from How Stuff Works, which was acquired in December 2007. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $6 million of international program sales revenue, which is now reported in the International Networks segment. Cost of revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cost of revenue decreased $164 million when compared with 2007, primarily due to a decrease in content amortization expense of $156 million. The decrease in content amortization expense was primarily a result of the effect of the $129 million content impairment charge recorded in 2007 following a change in management and related changes in strategy. This charge coupled with the related $76 million decrease in content amortization expense was offset by $17 million of content impairment charges for TLC programs following a change in management and related changes in strategy in the second half of 2008, and content amortization expense for new programming on Discovery Channel, TLC, Planet Green and Science Channel. Selling, general administrative expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007, which was primarily a result 48 Table of Contents of a $34 million increase in personnel costs, primarily driven by continued investment in digital media, including acquisitions made during the third and fourth quarters of 2007. This increase was partially offset by decreased marketing expense of $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with the corresponding prior year period. International Networks Years Ended December 31, 2007 2008 As Adjusted % Change (Amounts in millions) Revenues: Distribution $ 713 $ 615 16 % Advertising 336 330 2 % Other 109 85 28 % Total revenues $ 1,158 $ 1,030 12 % Operating costs and expenses: Cost of revenues $ 394 $ 373 6 % Selling, general and administrative 418 447 (6 )% Total operating costs and expenses $ 812 $ 820 (1 )% Revenue. Total revenue increased $128 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007, driven by an increase in distribution revenue of $98 million. Distribution revenue increased $76 million in EMEA, Latin America, and Asia primarily as a result of a 16% increase in average paying subscription units. In addition, foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $13 million on distribution revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007. Advertising revenue increased $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007. Advertising revenue increased $42 million in EMEA and Latin America primarily due to higher viewership combined with an increased subscriber base in most markets worldwide. These increases were offset by a $35 million decrease in the U.K. due to an interpretation of a contract provision resulting in a limitation in our ability to monetize our audience in the U.K., as well as, a deterioration in market conditions. Advertising revenue decreased $4 million due to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Other revenue increased $24 million mainly due to improvement in licensing and sales of programs primarily in the U.K. offset by a $2 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007, driven by a $40 million increase in content amortization expense due to continued investment in original productions and language customization to support additional local feeds for growth in local ad sales partially offset by favorable foreign exchange of $10 million and a reduction in sales commissions of $5 million. Selling general administrative expenses. Selling, general administrative expenses decreased $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007. This decrease was driven by a $26 million reduction in marketing expenditures coupled with the favorable impact of $3 million from foreign exchange. 49 Table of Contents Commerce, Education, and Other Years Ended December 31, 2007 2008 As Adjusted % Change (Amounts in millions) Total revenues $ 196 $ 225 (13 )% Operating costs and expenses: Cost of revenues $ 116 $ 151 (23 )% Selling, general and administrative 67 70 (4 )% Total operating costs and expenses $ 183 $ 221 (17 )% Revenue. Commerce, Education, and Other total revenue decreased $29 million for the year ended 2008 when compared with the prior year. A challenging retail environment in 2008 coupled with the success of the Planet Earth DVD in 2007 contributed to a year over year decline of 48% in revenue from the direct to consumer business, which was partially offset by higher licensing revenue. Education revenue increased by $6 million as the core streaming business continued to grow. New revenue streams in licensing and sponsorships were slightly offset by the decline in the hardcopy business as customers shifted to our digital services. Revenues generated by the CSS business were relatively flat compared with 2007. Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue decreased $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, commensurate with the decrease in Commerces product revenue coupled with a decrease in Educations content amortization, which resulted from the fourth quarter 2007 write off of capitalized content costs that were not aligned with Educations product offerings. Selling, general administrative expenses. Selling, general administrative expenses decreased $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower personnel and marketing costs incurred in Commerce and Education coupled with a $2 million legal expense in 2007 for a legal settlement. These decreases were partially offset by a slight increase in selling, general and administrative expense from the CSS business. Corporate and Intersegment Eliminations Years Ended December 31, 2007 2008 As Adjusted % Change (Amounts in millions) Total revenues $ 27 $ 7 NM Operating costs and expenses: Cost of revenues $ 5 $ 4 25 % Selling, general and administrative 223 192 16 % Total operating costs and expenses $ 228 $ 196 16 % Corporate is mainly comprised of ancillary revenue and expenses from a joint venture, corporate functions, executive management and administrative support services. Consistent with our segment reporting, corporate expenses are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate business segment performance based upon decisions made directly by business segment executives. Corporate revenue increased $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007, primarily due to increased ancillary revenue from a joint venture, whose primary sales were of the Planet Earth DVD; current sales volume is not expected to continue. Corporate costs increased $32 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008, driven by increased costs incurred in conjunction with our preparing to become a public entity as a result of the Newhouse Transaction and costs related to the start up of OWN. 50 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2007 vs. 2006 Prior to the Newhouse Transaction, our consolidated results of operations included 100% of AMCs results of operations, general and administrative expenses incurred at the DHC corporate level, as well as DHCs share of earnings of DCH. The Statement of Operations reflects the CSS business in revenue and operating costs and expenses, whereas the portion of AMCs businesses that were spun off as a result of the Newhouse Transaction are reflected in Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax.

Generally, these services pertain to the completion of feature films, television programs and advertisements. These projects normally span from a few days to three months or more in length, and fees for these projects typically range from less than $1,000 to $200,000. Expenses related to the corporate support from DHC are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. Cost of services and operating expenses consists primarily of production wages, facility costs and other direct costs. Revenue. Revenue for CSS decreased $4 million to $76 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, when compared with the same period in 2006. This decrease was driven by smaller feature sound projects and the shut down of certain audio facilities in 2006. Total operating costs and expenses. Total operating costs and expenses decreased $7 million to $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, when compared with the same period in 2006. This decrease was driven by the reduction of costs that resulted from the shut down of certain audio facilities and related selling, general and administrative expenses. Equity in earnings of Discovery Communications Holding, LLC. From January 1, 2006 through May 14, 2007, DHC recorded its 50% share of the earnings of DCH. Subsequent to May 14, 2007 and prior to 51 Table of Contents September 17, 2008, the date the Newhouse Transaction closed, DHC recorded its 662/3% share of the earnings of DCH. DHCs share of earnings in DCH increased $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, when compared with the same period in 2006. This increase resulted from DHCs $90 million share of DCHs gain on the Cox Transaction, along with an $8 million increase due to DHCs increase in share ownership in DCH from 50% to 662/3%. These increases were partially offset by higher long term incentive compensation expense for DCH personnel and higher interest at DCH as a result of debt incurred to close the Cox Transaction. Net loss from Discontinued Operations. The net loss from discontinued operations increased $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, from the comparable period in 2006, primarily as a result of a $72 million increase in charges related to the impairment of goodwill on the AMC business for the year ended December 31, 2007, when compared with the same period in 2006. The increase in goodwill impairment charges was partially offset by an improvement in operating performance on the AMC business. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table represents a comparison of the components of the statement of cash flows, as reported for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, with a reconciliation of historical DCH statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our as adjusted statement of cash flows represents the cash flow activities as if the Newhouse Transaction was completed January 1, 2007. The table includes the cash flow activity for AMC for both periods, including cash provided by operating activities of $28 million, cash provided by investing activities of $128 million, and cash used in financing activities of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. AMC cash provided by operating activities was $61 million, cash used in investing activities was $15 million, and cash provided by financing activities was $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. 52 Table of Contents For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 For the Year For the Year Ended Ended December 31, DHC Discovery December 31, 2008 As reported DCH as Adjusted 2006 (Amounts in millions) Operating Activities Net income (loss) $ 317 $ (68 ) $ $ (68 ) $ (46 ) Adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to cash provided by operating activities: 568 139 459 598 100 Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of discontinued operations: (316 ) (13 ) (217 ) (230 ) 19 Cash provided by operating activities 569 58 242 300 73 Investing Activities Purchases of property and equipment (102 ) (47 ) (81 ) (128 ) (77 ) Proceeds from business and asset dispositions 139 2 2 6 Net cash acquired from Newhouse Transaction 45 Business acquisitions, net of cash acquired (8 ) (306 ) (306 ) (47 ) Purchases of securities (52 ) Proceeds from sale of securities 24 28 28 Other investing activities, net 2 (44 ) (42 ) 1 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 98 (15 ) (431 ) (446 ) (169 ) Financing Activities Ascent Media Corporation spin off (356 ) Borrowings from long term debt 1,500 1,500 Net repayments of revolver loans (125 ) (2 ) (2 ) Principal repayments of long term debt (257 ) (8 ) (8 ) Principal repayments of capital lease obligations (29 ) (6 ) (6 ) Repurchase of members interests (1,285 ) (1,285 ) Net cash from stock option exercises 13 13 Other financing activities, net (7 ) (1 ) (24 ) (25 ) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities (774 ) 12 175 187 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (2 ) 7 7 Change in cash and cash equivalents (109 ) 55 (7 ) 48 (96 ) Cash and cash equivalents of continuing operations, beginning of period 1 52 53 Cash and cash equivalents of discontinued operations, beginning of period 209 153 153 250 Adjustment to remove AMC cash (201 ) (201 ) Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 100 $ 8 $ 45 $ 53 $ 154 The DHC amounts are reported net of adjustments of $222 million for net income, $142 million to eliminate the DHC equity pick up of DCH, and $80 million to allocate minority interest to Advance/Newhouse. Sources of Cash Our principal sources of liquidity are cash in hand, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. We anticipate that our cash flows from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. 53 Table of Contents Total Liquidity at December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008 we had approximately $1.3 billion of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $100 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow approximately $1.2 billion under our revolving credit facilities. In October 2008, we repaid $11 million outstanding under our U.K. revolving credit facility. This facility was closed at our election in December 2008 and would have expired according to its terms in April 2009. Cash Provided by Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2008, our cash provided by operating activities was $569 million compared to $300 million for the same period as adjusted in 2007. Proceeds from the sale of business. During the year ended December 31, 2008, AMC received proceeds of $139 million primarily from the sale of Accent Health as part of the spin off of AMC. Debt Facilities. Our committed debt facilities include two term loans, a revolving loan facility and various senior notes payable. The second term loan was entered into on May 14, 2007 for $1.5 billion in connection with the Cox Transaction. Total commitments of these facilities were $4.9 billion at December 31, 2008. Debt outstanding on these facilities aggregated $3.7 billion at December 31, 2008, providing excess debt availability of $1.2 billion. We currently have fixed the interest rate on the majority of our outstanding debt. The anticipated interest payments, together with the scheduled principal payments, due over the next year are within the available capacity on our committed facilities. Although we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations and to meet our debt service obligations over the next 12 months, we may seek to arrange new financing in the current year in advance of the maturity of our debt facility in 2010. Also, our current performance on the leverage and other financial maintenance tests is at levels within the established thresholds of the debt agreements indicating some ability to absorb lower than expected operating results and still remain within the covenant limits. DCHs $1.5 billion term loan is secured by its assets, excluding assets held by its subsidiaries. The remaining term loan, revolving loan and senior notes are unsecured. The debt facilities contain covenants that require the respective borrowers to meet certain financial ratios and place restrictions on the payment of dividends, sale of assets, additional borrowings, mergers, and purchases of capital stock, assets and investments. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2008. Our interest expense associated with our debt facilities is exposed to movements in short term interest rates. Derivative instruments, including both fixed to variable and variable to fixed interest rate instruments, are used to modify this exposure. The variable to fixed interest rate instruments have a notional principal amount of $2.3 billion and have a weighted average interest rate of 4.68% against 3 month LIBOR at December 31, 2008. The fixed to variable interest rate agreements have a notional principal amount of $50 million and have a weighted average interest rate of 7.90% against fixed rate private placement debt at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, we held an unexercised interest rate swap put with a notional amount of $25 million at a fixed rate of 5.44%. On January 29, 2009, we entered into interest rate swap transactions which will become effective on June 30, 2010, with a notional amount of $200 million. Under the swap transactions, we will make quarterly payments at a rate of approximately 2.935% per annum to the swap counterparties in exchange for a payment approximately equal to the variable rate payable under our Credit, Pledge and Security Agreement dated as of May 14, 2007. The swap transactions terminate on March 31, 2014, which is the interest payment date before the maturity date of our Credit, Pledge and Security Agreement, which is May 14, 2014. The terms of the swap transactions are governed by customary ISDA interest rate swap agreements. By entering into these swap transactions, we have effectively fixed the interest rate on $200 million of the borrowings under its Credit, Pledge and Security Agreement at approximately 4.935% per annum, starting as of June 30, 2010. Uses of Cash During the year ended December 31, 2008, our primary uses of cash were cash payments for content of $803 million, mandatory principal payments under our bank facilities and senior notes totaling $257 million, 54 Table of Contents cash payments of $125 million under our revolving loans, capital expenditures of $102 million, and payments under our LTIP of $49 million. During the year ended December 31, 2007, on an as adjusted basis, our primary uses of cash were the redemption of Coxs equity interests of $1.3 billion, cash payments for content of $706 million and capital expenditures of $127 million. In 2009, we expect our uses of cash to be approximately $445 million for debt repayments, $225 million for interest expense, and $60 million for capital expenditures. We have no material commitments for capital expenditures. We will also be required to make payments under our LTIP as well as for stock appreciation rights issued under our Incentive Plan. Amounts expensed and payable under the LTIP are dependent on future annual calculations of unit values which are primarily affected by changes in our stock price, changes in units outstanding, and changes to the plan. Joint Venture Arrangement. On June 19, 2008, we entered in to a 50 50 joint venture with Oprah Winfrey and Harpo, Inc. (Harpo) to rebrand Discovery Health Channel as OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN Network). It is expected that Discovery Health will be rebranded as OWN in late 2009 or early 2010. Pursuant to the agreement, we have committed to make capital contributions of up to $100 million through September 30, 2011, of which $6 million has been funded as of December 31, 2008. We anticipate that a significant portion of the $100 million funding obligation will occur in 2009. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity If we were to experience a significant decline in operating performance, or have to meet an unanticipated need for additional liquidity beyond our available commitments, there is no certainty that we would be able to access the needed liquidity. While we have established relationships with U.S. and international banks and investors which continue to participate in our various credit agreements, the current tightening in the credit markets may cause some lenders to have to reduce or withdraw their commitments if we were to seek to negotiate a refinancing or an increase in our total commitments. Covenants in existing debt agreements may constrain our capacity for additional debt or there may be significant increases in costs to refinance existing debt to access additional liquidity. As a public company, we may have access to other sources of capital such as the public bond and equity markets. However, access to sufficient liquidity in these markets is not assured given our substantial debt outstanding and the continued volatility in the equity markets and further tightening in the credit markets. Our access to capital markets can be affected by factors outside of our control. In addition, our cost to borrow is impacted by market conditions and our financial performance as measured by certain credit metrics defined in our credit agreements, including interest coverage and leverage ratios. Contractual Obligations We have agreements covering leases of satellite transponders, facilities and equipment. These agreements expire at various dates through 2028. We are obligated to license programming under agreements with content suppliers that expire over various dates. We also have other contractual commitments arising in the ordinary course of business. 55 Table of Contents A summary of all of the expected payments for these commitments as well as future principal payments under the current debt arrangements and minimum payments under capital leases at December 31, 2008 is as follows: Payments Due by Period(1) Less than 1 More than Total Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt $ 3,721 445 1,128 355 1,793 Interest payments(2) 735 217 274 179 65 Capital leases 82 18 34 20 10 Operating leases 359 66 105 73 115 Content 538 354 102 82 Other(3) 394 101 115 41 137 Total $ 5,829 1,201 1,758 750 2,120 (1) Table does not include certain long term obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as the timing of the payments cannot be predicted or the amounts will not be settled in cash. The most significant of these obligations is the $23 million accrued under our LTIP plans. In addition, amounts accrued in our consolidated balance sheet related to derivative financial instruments are not included in the table as such amounts may not be settled in cash or the timing of the payments cannot be predicted. (2) Amounts (i) are based on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2008, (ii) assume the interest rates on our floating rate debt remain constant at the December 31, 2008 rates and (iii) assume that our existing debt is repaid at maturity. (3) Represents our obligations to purchase goods and services whereby the underlying agreements are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. The more significant purchase obligations include: obligations to purchase goods and services, employment contracts, sponsorship agreements and transmission services. We are subject to a contractual agreement that may require us to acquire the minority interest of certain of our subsidiaries. The amount and timing of such payments are not currently known. We have recorded a $49 million liability as of December 31, 2008 for this redemption right. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. Critical accounting policies impact the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates. An appreciation of our critical accounting policies facilitates an understanding of our financial results. Amounts disclosed relate to Discovery, as adjusted for 2007 and Discovery for 2008. Unless otherwise noted, we applied critical accounting policies and estimates methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. For further information regarding these critical accounting policies and estimates, please see the Notes to our consolidated financial statements. Revenue We derive revenue from (i) distribution revenue from cable systems, satellite operators and other distributors, (ii) advertising aired on our networks and websites, and (iii) other, which is largely e commerce and educational sales. 56 Table of Contents Distribution. Distributors generally pay a per subscriber fee for the right to distribute our programming under the terms of long term distribution contracts (distribution revenue). Distribution revenue is reported net of incentive costs or other consideration, if any, offered to system operators in exchange for long term distribution contracts. We recognize distribution revenue over the term of the contracts based on contracted monthly license fee provisions and reported subscriber levels. Network incentives have historically included upfront cash incentives referred to as launch support in connection with the launch of a network by the distributor within certain time frames. Any such amounts are capitalized as assets upon launch of our programming by the distributor and are amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction of revenue over the terms of the contracts. In instances where the distribution agreement is extended prior to the expiration of the original term, we evaluate the economics of the extended term and, if it is determined that the deferred launch asset continues to benefit us over the extended term, then we will adjust the launch amortization period accordingly. Other incentives are recognized as a reduction of revenue as incurred. The amount of distribution revenue due to us is reported by distributors based on actual subscriber levels. Such information is generally not received until after the close of the reporting period. Therefore, reported distribution revenue is based upon our estimates of the number of subscribers receiving our programming for the month, plus an adjustment for the prior month estimate. Our subscriber estimates are based on the most recent remittance or confirmation of subscribers received from the distributor. Advertising. We record advertising revenue net of agency commissions and audience deficiency liabilities in the period advertising spots are broadcast. A substantial portion of the advertising sold in the United States includes guaranteed levels of audience that either the program or the advertisement will reach. Deferred revenue is recorded and adjusted as the guaranteed audience levels are achieved. Audience guarantees are initially developed by our internal research group and actual audience and delivery information is provided by third party ratings services. In certain instances, the third party ratings information is not received until after the close of the reporting period. In these cases, reported advertising revenue and related deferred revenue is based on our estimates for any under delivery of contracted advertising ratings based on the most current data available from the third party ratings service. Differences between the estimated under delivery and the actual under delivery have historically been insignificant. Online advertising revenues are recognized as impressions are delivered. Certain of our advertising arrangements include deliverables in addition to commercial time, such as the advertisers product integration into the programming, customized vignettes, and billboards. These contracts that include other deliverables are evaluated as multiple element revenue arrangements under EITF 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Commerce, Education, and Other. Commerce revenue is recognized upon product shipment, net of estimated returns, which are not material to our consolidated financial statements. Educational service sales are generally recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. CSS services revenue is recognized when services are performed. Revenue from post production and certain distribution related services is recognized when services are provided. Prepayments received for services to be performed at a later date are deferred. Derivative Financial Instruments Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, (FAS 133), requires every derivative instrument to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as either an asset or a liability. The statement also requires that changes in the fair value of derivatives be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. We use financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges. The effective changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as interest expense is recorded for debt. We use the cumulative dollar offset method to assess effectiveness. To be highly effective, the ratio calculated by dividing the cumulative change in the value of the actual swap by the cumulative change in the hypothetical swap must be between 80% and 125%. The ineffective portion of a derivatives change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. We use derivative instruments principally to manage the risk associated 57 Table of Contents with the movements of foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates that will affect the cash flows of our debt transactions. Refer to Note 12 for additional information regarding derivative instruments held by us and risk management strategies. Content Rights Costs incurred in the direct production, co production or licensing of content rights are capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost, fair value, or net realizable value. In accordance with SOP 00 2, Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films, we amortize our content assets based upon the ratio of current revenue to total estimated revenue (ultimate revenue). To determine this ratio, we analyze historical and projected usage for similar programming and apply such usage factors to projected revenue by network adjusted for any future significant programming strategy changes. The result of this policy is an accelerated amortization pattern for the fully distributed U.S. Networks segment (Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet) and Discovery Channel in the International Networks segment over a period of no more than four years. The accelerated amortization pattern results in the amortization of approximately 40% to 50% of the program cost during the first year. Topical or current events programming is amortized over shorter periods based on the nature of the programming and may be expensed upon its initial airing. All other networks in the U.S. Networks segment and International Networks segment utilize up to five year useful life. For these networks, with programming investment levels lower than the established networks and higher reuse of programming, straight line amortization is considered a reasonable estimate of the use of content consistent with the pace of earning ultimate revenue. Ultimate revenue assessments include advertising and affiliate revenue streams. Ancillary revenue is considered immaterial to the assessment. Changes in managements assumptions, such as changes in expected use, could significantly alter our estimates for amortization. Amortization is approximately $658 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and the unamortized programming balance at December 31, 2008 is $1.2 billion. Programming that we expect to alter planned use by reduction or removal from a network because of changes in network strategy is written down to its net realizable value based on adjusted ultimate revenues when identified. On a periodic basis, management evaluates the net realizable value of content in conjunction with our strategic review of the business. Changes in managements assumptions, such as changes in expected use, could significantly alter our estimates for write offs. During the third quarter 2008, we implemented significant changes in brand strategies for TLC. As a result, we recorded a content impairment charge of $17 million, which is included as a component of content amortization expense. Consolidated content impairment, including accelerated amortization of certain programs is approximately $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Expenses Arising from Long Term Incentive Plans Expenses arising from liability awards based on long term incentive plans are primarily related to our unit based, long term incentive plan (LTIP), for our employees who meet certain eligibility criteria. Units were awarded to eligible employees and vest at a rate of 25% per year. Prior to the Newhouse Transaction, we accounted for the LTIP in accordance with FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and EITF 02 08, Accounting for Options Granted to Employees in Unrestricted, Publicly Traded Shares of an Unrelated Entity, as the value of units in the LTIP was indexed to the value of DHC Series A common stock. Upon redemption of the LTIP awards, participants received a cash payment based on the difference between the market price of DHC Series A common stock on the vesting date and the market price on the date of grant. Following the Newhouse Transaction, units remained outstanding and were adjusted to track changes in the value of our publicly traded stock. We account for these cash settled stock appreciation awards in accordance with FAS 123(R), Share Based Payment. The value of units in the LTIP is calculated using the Black Scholes model each reporting period, and the change in unit value of LTIP awards outstanding is recorded as compensation expense over the period outstanding. We elected to attribute expense for the units in accordance with FAS 123R. We use volatility of 58 Table of Contents DHC common stock or our common stock, if available, in our Black Scholes models. However, if the term of the units is in excess of the period common stock has been outstanding, we use a combination of historical and implied volatility. Different assumptions could result in different market valuations. However the most significant factor in determining the unit value is the price of common stock. Goodwill and Indefinite lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. Our 2008 annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter, did not result in any impairment charges. However, over the past year, the decline in our stock price suggests in a lower estimated fair value for each of our reporting units. As a result of this decline, the estimated fair value of the U.K. reporting unit approximates its carrying value. Accordingly, future declines in estimated fair values may result in goodwill impairment charges. It is possible that such charges, if required, could be recorded prior to the fourth quarter of 2009 (i.e., during an interim period) if our stock price, our results of operations, or other factors require such assets to be tested for impairment at an interim date. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. In performing the first step, we determine the fair value of a reporting unit by using two valuation techniques: a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and a market based approach. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the DCF analyses are based on our budget and long term business plan. In assessing the reasonableness of its determined fair values, we evaluate our results against other value indicators such as comparable company public trading values, research analyst estimates and values observed in market transactions. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is required to be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill and non amortizing trademarks. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. In other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The estimates of fair value of intangible assets not subject to amortization are determined using a DCF valuation analysis. Long lived Assets Long lived assets (e.g., amortizing trademarks, customer lists, other intangibles and property, plant and equipment) do not require that an annual impairment test be performed; instead, long lived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Triggering events include the likely (i.e., more likely than not) disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. If the intent is to hold the asset for continued use, the impairment test first requires a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows against the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset would be deemed to be impaired. Impairment would then be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by discounting the future cash flows associated with that asset. If the intent is to hold the asset for sale and certain other 59 Table of Contents criteria are met (e.g., the asset can be disposed of currently, appropriate levels of authority have approved the sale, and there is an active program to locate a buyer), the impairment test involves comparing the assets carrying value to its fair value. To the extent the carrying value is greater than the assets fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred, determining the future cash flows for the assets involved and determining the proper discount rate to be applied in determining fair value. In 2007, there were no significant long lived asset impairments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded long lived asset impairments of $30 million for HSW and $2 million for exit costs of certain operations. The determination of recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles and long lived assets requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future cash flows, fair values, and the appropriate grouping of assets. Such estimates are subject to change and could result in impairment losses being recognized in the future. If different reporting units, asset groupings, or different valuation methodologies had been used, the impairment test results could have differed. Deferred Launch Incentives Consideration issued to cable and satellite distributors in connection with the execution of long term network distribution agreements is deferred and amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction to revenue over the terms of the agreements. Obligations for fixed launch incentives are recorded at the inception of the agreement. Following the renewal of a distribution agreement, the remaining deferred consideration is amortized over the extended period. Amortization of deferred launch incentives was $75 million and $100 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2007, in connection with the settlement of terms under a pre existing distribution agreement, we completed negotiations for the renewal of long term distribution agreements for certain of our U.K. networks and paid a distributor $196 million, most of which is being amortized over a five year period. Redeemable Interests in Subsidiaries For those instruments with an estimated redemption value, redeemable interests in subsidiaries are accreted or amortized to an estimated redemption value ratably over the period to the redemption date. Accretion and amortization are recorded as a component of minority interest expense. Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will be unrealized. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In instances where we have taken or expect to take a tax position in its tax return and we believe it is more likely than not that such tax position will be upheld by the relevant taxing authority upon settlement, we may record the benefits of such tax position in our consolidated financial statements. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The adoption of FIN 48 did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP No. EITF 03 6 1). This FSP provides that all outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to non forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are 60 Table of Contents considered participating securities. Because such awards are considered participating securities, the issuing entity is required to apply the two class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. The provisions of FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 will be effective for us on January 1, 2009, and will be applied retrospectively to all prior period earnings per share computations. The adoption of FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 will not have a material impact on our earnings per share amounts. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP 142 3), which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset pursuant to FAS No. 142. The provisions of FSP 142 3 will be effective for us on January 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact that the provisions of FSP 142 3 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, as amended (FAS 161). FAS No. 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133), to include information about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FAS 133 and its related interpretations; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The provisions of FAS 161 will be effective for us on January 1, 2009. The adoption of FAS 161 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141R). This Statement requires, among other things, that companies: (1) expense business acquisition transaction costs, which are presently included in the cost of the acquisition, (2) record an asset for in process research and development, which is presently expensed at the time of the acquisition, (3) record at fair value amounts for contingencies, including contingent consideration, as of the purchase date with subsequent adjustments recognized in operations, which is presently accounted for as an adjustment of purchase price, (4) recognize decreases in valuation allowances on acquired deferred tax assets in operations, which were are presently considered to be subsequent changes in consideration and are recorded as decreases in goodwill, and (5) measure at fair value any non controlling interest in the acquiree. The provisions of FAS 141R will be effective for us on January 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively to new business combinations consummated on or subsequent to the effective date. Generally, the effects of FAS 141R will depend on future acquisitions. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (FAS 160). FAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary, commonly referred to as minority interest. Among other matters, FAS 160 requires that non controlling interests be reported within equity in the balance sheet and that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interest to be clearly presented in the statement of income. The provisions of FAS 160 will be effective for us on January 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which shall be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of FAS 160 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 07 1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements (EITF 07 1). EITF 07 1 defines collaborative arrangements and establishes accounting and reporting requirements for transactions between participants in the arrangement and third parties. A collaborative arrangement is a contractual arrangement that involves a joint operating activity, for example an agreement to co produce and distribute programming with another media company. The provisions of EITF 07 1 will be effective for us on January 1, 2009, and will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact that EITF 07 1 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We continually monitor our economic exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates and may enter into foreign exchange agreements where and when appropriate. Substantially all of our foreign transactions are denominated in foreign currencies, including the liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries. Although our foreign transactions are not generally subject to significant foreign exchange transaction gains or losses, the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars as part of our consolidated financial reporting. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations. Our earnings and cash flow are exposed to market risk and can be affected by, among other things, economic conditions, interest rate changes, and foreign currency fluctuations. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. We use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long term debt are expected to vary as a result of future requirements, market conditions and other factors. Our interest expense is exposed to movements in short term interest rates. Derivative instruments, including both fixed to variable and variable to fixed interest rate instruments, are used to modify this exposure. These instruments include swaps and swaptions to modify interest rate exposure. The variable to fixed interest rate instruments had a notional principal amount of $2.3 billion and a weighted average interest rate of 4.68% at December 31, 2008 for us and December 31, 2007 for DCH. The fixed to variable interest rate agreements had a notional principal amount of $50 million and $225 million and had a weighted average interest rate of 7.90% and 9.65% at December 31, 2008 for us and December 31, 2007 for DCH, respectively. At December 31, 2008, we held an unexercised interest rate swap put with a notional amount of $25 million at a fixed rate of 5.44%. The fair value of these derivative instruments, which aggregate ($106) million and ($50) million at December 31, 2008 for us and December 31, 2007 for DCH, respectively, is recorded as a component of long term liabilities and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Of the total of $2.9 billion principal amount, a notional amount of $2 billion of these derivative instruments are highly effective cash flow hedges. The value of these hedges at December 31, 2008 was ($71) million with changes in the mark to market value recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. Should any portion of these instruments become ineffective due to a restructuring in our debt, the monthly changes in fair value would be reported as a component of other income on the Statement of Operations. We do not expect material hedge ineffectiveness in the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2008, a parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve equal to one percentage point would change the fair value of our interest rate derivative portfolio by approximately $49 million. In addition, a change of one percentage point in interest rates on variable rate debt would impact interest expense by approximately $6 million on a yearly basis. Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow. Accordingly, we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments that change in value as foreign exchange rates change. The foreign exchange instruments used are spot, forward, and option contracts. Additionally, we enter into non designated forward contracts to hedge non dollar denominated cash flows and foreign currency balances. At December 31, 2008 for us, and December 31, 2007 for DCH, the notional amount of foreign exchange derivative contracts was $75 million and $174 million, respectively. The fair value of these derivative instruments is recorded as a component of long term liabilities and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. These derivative instruments did not receive hedge accounting treatment. As of December 31, 2008, an estimated 10% adverse movement in exchange rates against the US dollar would decrease the fair value of our portfolio by approximately $5 million. We continually monitor our positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments and do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. In addition, we limit the amount of investment credit exposure with any one institution. 62 Table of Contents

Introduction Managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. This discussion is organized as follows: Overview. This section provides a general description of our business segments, as well as recent developments we believe are important in understanding the results of operations and financial condition, including a discussion of the Newhouse Transaction. Results of Operations 2008 vs. 2007. This section provides an analysis of our result of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. In order to assist the reader in better understanding our operations, a table is provided that reconciles our and DHCs prior year income statements presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) to the financial information discussed in our adjusted results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. This analysis is presented on both a consolidated and a business segment basis. Results of Operations 2007 vs. 2006. This section provides an analysis of DHCs prior year income statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, restated to reflect AMC as a discontinued operation, as a result of the completion of the Newhouse Transaction Liquidity and Capital Resources. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2008, as well as a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments that existed as of December 31, 2008. Included in the analysis of outstanding debt is a discussion of the amount of financial capacity available to fund our future commitments, as well as other financing arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies. This section identifies those accounting policies that are considered important to our results of operations and financial condition, require significant judgment and require estimates on the part of management in application. All of our significant accounting policies, including those considered critical accounting policies, are also summarized in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 37 Table of Contents Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. This section discusses how we manage exposure to potential gains and losses arising from changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and changes in the market value of financial instruments. Overview We are a leading global media and entertainment company that provides original and purchased programming across multiple distribution platforms in the United States and approximately 170 other countries, including television networks offering customized programming in 35 languages. Our strategy is to optimize the distribution, ratings and profit potential of each of our branded channels. We own and operate a diversified portfolio of website properties and other digital services and develop and sell consumer and educational products and media sound services in the United States and internationally. We operate through three divisions: (1) U.S. Networks, (2) International Networks, and (3) Commerce, Education, and Other. Our media content is designed to target key audience demographics and the popularity of our programming creates a reason for advertisers to purchase commercial time on our channels. Audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators, direct to home or DTH satellite operators and other content distributors to deliver our programming to their customers. The current economic conditions, and any continuation of these adverse conditions, may adversely affect the economic prospects of advertisers and could alter their current spending priorities. In addition to growing distribution and advertising revenue for our branded channels, we are focused on growing revenue across new distribution platforms, including brand aligned web properties, mobile devices, video on demand and broadband channels, which serve as additional outlets for advertising and affiliate sales, and provide promotional platforms for our programming. We also operate internet sites, such as HowStuffWorks.com, providing supplemental news, information and entertainment content that are aligned with our television programming. We will continue to incur incremental legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We will incur costs associated with public company reporting requirements and costs associated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. We are incurring additional costs to prepare for the management attestation requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and the related attestation by the independent registered public accounting firm to which we will first be subject in 2009. U.S. Networks U.S. Networks is our largest division, which owns and operates 11 cable and satellite channels, including Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet, as well as a portfolio of website properties and other digital services. U.S. Networks also provides distribution and advertising sales services for Travel Channel and distribution services for BBC America and BBC World News. U.S. Networks derives revenue primarily from distribution fees and advertising sales, which comprised 45% and 51%, respectively, of revenue for this division for the year ended December 31, 2008. During each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet collectively generated more than 73% of U.S. Networks total revenue. U.S. Networks earns distribution fees under multi year affiliation agreements with cable operators, DTH operators and other distributors of television programming. Distribution fees are based on the number of subscribers receiving programming. Upon the launch of a new channel, we may initially pay distributors to carry such channel (such payments are referred to as launch incentives), or may provide the channel to the distributor for free for a predetermined length of time. Launch incentives are amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction of revenue over the term of the affiliation agreement. U.S. Networks sells commercial time on our networks and websites. The number of subscribers to our channels, the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels are key drivers of advertising revenue. Several of our domestic networks, including Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet, are currently distributed to substantially all of the cable television and direct broadcast satellite homes in the U.S. 38 Table of Contents Accordingly, the rate of growth in U.S. distribution revenue in future periods is expected to be less than historical rates. Our other U.S. Networks are distributed primarily on the digital tier of cable systems and equivalent tiers on DTH platforms and have been successful in maximizing their distribution within this more limited universe. There is, however, no guarantee that these digital networks will ever be able to gain the distribution levels or advertising rates of our major networks. Our contractual arrangements with U.S. distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. In 2008, we renewed the distribution agreements with one of our largest distributors. U.S. Networks largest single cost is the cost of programming, including production costs for original programming. U.S. Networks amortizes the cost of original or purchased programming based on the expected realization of revenue resulting in an accelerated amortization for Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet and straight line amortization over three to five years for the remaining networks. International Networks International Networks manages a portfolio of channels, led by the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet brands that are distributed in virtually every pay television market in the world through an infrastructure that includes major operational centers in London, Singapore, New Delhi and Miami. International Networks regional operations cover most major markets including the U.K., Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia, Latin America and India. International Networks currently operates over 100 unique distribution feeds in 35 languages with channel feeds customized according to language needs and advertising sales opportunities. Most of the divisions channels are wholly owned by us with the exception of (1) the international Animal Planet channels, which are generally joint ventures in which the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) owns 50%, (2) People + Arts, which operates in Latin America and Iberia as a 50 50 joint venture with the BBC and (3) several channels in Japan, Canada and Poland, which operate as joint ventures with strategically important local partners. Similar to U.S. Networks, the primary sources of revenue for International Networks are distribution fees and advertising sales, and the primary cost is programming. International Networks executes a localization strategy by offering high quality shared programming with U.S. Networks, customized content, and localized schedules via our distribution feeds. Distribution revenue represents approximately 62% of the divisions operating revenue and continues to deliver growth in markets with the highest potential for pay television expansion. Advertising sales are increasingly important to the divisions financial success. International television markets vary in their stages of development. Some, notably the U.K., are among the more advanced digital multi channel television markets in the world, while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital. We believe there is growth in many international markets including Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe that are in the early stage of pay TV evolution. In developing pay TV markets, we expect to see advertising revenue growth from subscriber growth, our localization strategy, and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay TV. In relatively mature markets, such as the U.K., the growth dynamic is changing. Increased penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid growth in those markets. Instead, growth in advertising sales will come from increasing viewership and advertising pricing on our existing pay TV networks and launching new services, either in pay TV or free television environments. One such new launch came in early 2006 when the Company acquired a broadly distributed free to air cable channel in Germany and relaunched it as DMAX. Another launch will come in 2009, when we will launch a digital terrestrial channel in the U.K. on the free platform known as Freeview, which now has over 10 million homes. Neither of these channels generate distribution fees, but both are broadly distributed enough to have strong advertising sales potential. Our international businesses are subject to a number of risks including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, regulatory issues, and political instability. Changes in any of these areas could adversely affect the performance of the International Networks. International Networks priorities include maintaining a leadership position in nonfiction and certain fictional entertainment in international markets and continuing to grow and improve the performance of the 39 Table of Contents international operations. These priorities will be achieved through expanding local advertising sales capabilities, creating licensing and digital growth opportunities, and improving operating efficiencies by strengthening programming and promotional collaboration between U.S. and International Network groups. Commerce, Education, and Other During 2007, DCH evaluated its commerce business and made the decision to transition from running brick and mortar retail locations to leveraging its products through retail arrangements and an e commerce and catalog platform. In the third quarter of 2007, DCH completed the closing of its 103 mall based and stand alone Discovery Channel stores. As a result of the store closures, our as adjusted results of operations have been prepared to reflect the retail store business as discontinued operations. Accordingly, the revenue, costs and expenses of the retail store business have been excluded from the respective captions in our financial statements and have been reported as discontinued operations. In February 2009, we announced our plan to transition our commerce business to a royalty model, thereby providing for growth in profitability and reducing the financial risk of holding significant product inventories. As such, we will outsource the commerce direct to consumer operations including our commerce website, related marketing, product development and fulfillment to a third party in exchange for royalties. We expect to complete the transition in the second quarter of 2009. Our new structure for our commerce business will enable us to continue offering high quality Discovery Blu Ray and standard definition DVD programming as well as many merchandise categories leveraging both licensed and make and sell products. Although we expect this new structure to facilitate growth in operating income, we expect an initial compression in top line revenue contribution, as well as a reduction in direct operating expenses in 2009. Commerce will continue to grow our established brand and home video licensing businesses to further expand our national presence in key retailers. Our commerce operations continue to add value to our television assets by reinforcing consumer loyalty and creating opportunities for our advertising and distribution partners. Our education business will continue to focus on our direct to school streaming distribution subscription services as well as our benchmark student assessment services, publishing and distributing hardcopy content through a network of distribution channels including online, catalog and dealers. Our education business also participates in a growing sponsorship and global brand and content licensing business. With the completion of the Newhouse Transaction, the operating results of the Creative Sound Services (CSS) businesses, which provide sound, music, mixing sound effects and other related services under brand names such as Sound One, POP Sound, Soundelux and Todd A O, are reported in the Commerce, Education, and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Newhouse Transaction On September 17, 2008, we were formed as a result of DHC and Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership (Advance/Newhouse) combining their respective interests in Discovery and exchanging those interests with the Company (the Newhouse Transaction). The Newhouse Transaction provided, among other things, for the combination of DHCs 662/3% interest with Advance/Newhouses 331/3% interest in DCH. The Newhouse Transaction was completed as follows: On September 17, 2008, DHC completed the spin off to its shareholders of Ascent Media Corporation (AMC), a subsidiary holding cash and all of the businesses of its wholly owned subsidiaries except for CSS (which businesses remained with us following the completion of the Newhouse Transaction) (the AMC spin off); On September 17, 2008, immediately following the AMC spin off, DHC merged with a transitory merger subsidiary of the Company, and DHCs existing shareholders received common stock of the Company; and On September 17, 2008, immediately following the DHC exchange of shares for ours, Advance/Newhouse contributed its interests in us and Animal Planet to us in exchange for shares of our Series A 40 Table of Contents and Series C convertible preferred stock that are convertible at any time into our common stock, which at the transaction date represented one third of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result of the Newhouse Transaction, we became the successor reporting entity to DHC under the Exchange Act. Because Advance/Newhouse was a one third owner of Discovery prior to the completion of the Newhouse Transaction and is a one third owner of us immediately following completion of the Newhouse Transaction, there was no effective change in ownership. Our convertible preferred stock does not have any special dividend rights and only a de minimis liquidation preference. Additionally, Advance/Newhouse retains significant participatory special class voting rights with respect to certain matters that could be submitted to stockholder vote. Pursuant to FASB Technical Bulletin 85 5, Issues Relating to Accounting for Business Combinations, for accounting purposes the Newhouse Transaction was treated as a non substantive merger, and therefore, the Newhouse Transaction was recorded at the investors historical basis. For financial reporting purposes, we are the successor reporting entity to DHC. Because there is no effective change in ownership, in accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, paragraph 11, both DHC and DCH will be consolidated in our financial statements as if the transaction had occurred January 1, 2008. The presentation of the DCH financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP includes the results of DCHs operations as an equity method investment for the period prior to January 1, 2008. For purposes of analyzing DCHs business in this managements discussion and analysis, we have presented our consolidated operating results for 2008 consistent with our financial statement presentation, while the 2007 results have been presented as if the Newhouse Transaction occurred on January 1, 2007. The following table summarizes the defined terms concerning the various Discovery entities included in this analysis: Entity Reference Discovery Communications, Inc. (post Newhouse Transaction) The Company, Discovery, we, or us Discovery Communications Holding, LLC DCH Discovery Holding Company DHC Ascent Media Corporation AMC Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership Advance/Newhouse Creative Sound Services CSS Discovery Restructuring and Travel Channel Disposition On May 14, 2007, Cox Communications Holdings, Inc. exchanged its 25% ownership interest in DCH for all of the capital stock of a subsidiary of DCH that held the Travel Channel and travelchannel.com and approximately $1.3 billion in cash. The result was an increase in DHCs proportional ownership of DCH from 50% to 662/3%. Consequently, DHCs 2007 earnings in equity interests of DCH reflect the change in ownership. Results of Operations 2008 vs. 2007 The following discussion of our results of operations is presented in three parts to assist the reader in better understanding our operations. The table below reconciles our and DHCs prior year income statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP to the financial information discussed in our adjusted results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. The second section is an overall discussion of our consolidated operating results. The third section includes a more detailed discussion of revenue and expense activity of our three operating divisions: U.S. Networks, International Networks, and Commerce, Education, and Other. 41 Table of Contents The following table represents the year ended December 31, 2007 on an as adjusted basis: For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Less: Add: Minority DHC(A) DCH Interest Discovery Historical Historical Adjustment As Adjusted (Amounts in millions, except per share amounts) Revenues: Distribution $ $ 1,477 $ $ 1,477 Advertising 1,345 1,345 Other 76 305 381 Total revenues 76 3,127 3,203 Operating costs and expenses: Cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization listed below 60 1,167 1,227 Selling, general and administrative 22 1,296 1,318 Depreciation and amortization 3 131 134 Asset impairments 26 26 Exit and restructuring charges 20 20 Gains on asset and business dispositions (1 ) (135 ) (136 ) Total operating costs and expenses 84 2,505 2,589 Operating (loss) income (8 ) 622 614 Other income (expense): Equity in earnings of Discovery Communications Holding, LLC 142 (142 )(B) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 9 9 Interest expense, net (249 ) (249 ) Other, net 8 (10 ) (2 ) Total other income (expense), net 150 (250 ) (142 ) (242 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests 142 372 (142 ) 372 Provision for income taxes (56 ) (77 ) (133 ) Minority interests, net of tax (8 ) (80 )(C) (88 ) Income from continuing operations 86 287 (222 ) 151 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (154 ) (65 ) (219 ) Net (loss) income $ (68 ) $ 222 $ (222 ) $ (68 ) Income per share from continuing operations, basic and diluted $ 0.31 $ 0.54 Loss per share from discontinued operations, basic and diluted $ (0.55 ) $ (0.78 ) Net loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.24 ) $ (0.24 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding, basic and diluted 281 281 (A) DHC results of operations represent DHC corporate costs and the results of CSS, while the results of AMC are included in net loss from discontinued operations.

Our consolidated revenue increased $240 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007. Distribution revenue increased $163 million during the year primarily due to International Networks subscriber growth combined with annual contract increases for the fully distributed U.S. Networks, offset by the disposition of Travel Channel. Advertising revenue increased $51 million for the period, and is primarily attributed to higher pricing and cash sellout rates in U.S. Networks. Other revenue increased $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007, primarily due to an increase in licensing revenue in the International Networks, increase in sales of the Planet Earth DVD through a joint venture, and increases in revenue from our representation of the Travel Channel through our U.S. Networks segment, offset by a decline in revenue from the direct to consumer business in our Commerce, Education, and Other business segment. Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue, which includes content amortization and other production related expenses in addition to distribution and merchandising costs, decreased $203 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared to 2007. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to the effect of content impairment charges in the fourth quarter 2007 of $139 million primarily in U.S. Networks coupled with a $76 million decrease in related amortization expense. These decreases were partially offset by increases in costs of revenue in the International Networks and content impairment related to TLC. Selling, general administrative. Selling, general administrative expenses, which include certain personnel, marketing and other general and administrative expenses, decreased $203 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 2007, primarily attributable to a $210 million decrease in expenses arising from long term incentive plans, which were partially offset by slight increases in costs incurred in conjunction with DCH preparing to become a consolidated subsidiary of ours as a result of the Newhouse Transaction and an increase in personnel costs in International Networks. Expenses arising from long term incentive plans are largely related to DCHs unit based, long term incentive plan, the Discovery Appreciation Plan or the DAP, or LTIP, which was modified to reflect our capital structure following the Newhouse Transaction. Prior to the Newhouse Transaction, the value of units in the LTIP was indexed to the value of DHC Series A common stock. After the Newhouse Transaction, the units remained outstanding and were converted at the effective time of the Newhouse Transaction to track changes in the value of our Series A common stock. The change in unit value of LTIP awards outstanding is recorded as expenses arising from long term incentive plans over the period outstanding. Primarily due to the decrease in both the DHC Series A common stock and our Series A common stock price during the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a benefit of $69 million to expenses arising from long term incentive plans in 2008 compared to expenses arising from long term incentive plans of $141 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. In the fourth quarter 2008, eligible new hires and promoted employees received stock options that vest in four equal installments, and those employees with LTIP units that vest between September 18, 2008 and March 14, 2009 will receive cash settled stock appreciation awards that expire in March 2010. We do not intend to make additional cash settled stock appreciation awards, except as may be required by contract or to employees in countries where stock option awards are not permitted. Depreciation and amortization. The increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2008 is due to an increase in intangible assets resulting from the reclassification of DHC intangibles following the Newhouse Transaction and the HowStuffWorks.com acquisition. Asset impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a write off of intangible assets of $30 million related to our HowStuffWorks.com business. This write off of intangible assets was due to the decline in the cash flows projected to be generated by the HowStuffWorks.com business. During the second quarter of 2007, DCH recorded an asset impairment of $26 million which represents write offs of intangible assets related to the education business . Exit and restructuring costs. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $31 million in restructuring charges, of which $11 million relates to the relocation and severance costs related to TLCs repositioning strategy, $6 million for the termination of a production group, and $6 million due to the closure of our commerce distribution center and our store headquarters offices along with the transition of the remaining commerce distribution services to third party service providers. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded restructuring charges of $20 million related to a number of organizational and strategic adjustments. The purpose of these adjustments was to better align our organizational structure with our new strategic priorities and to respond to continuing changes within the media industry. 44 Table of Contents Gain on disposition of a business. In 2007, we exchanged the capital stock of a subsidiary that held the Travel Channel and travelchannel.com (collectively, the Travel Business) for Cox Communications Holdings, Inc.s 25% ownership interest in us and $1.3 billion in cash. The distribution of the Travel Business, which was valued at $575 million, resulted in a $135 million tax free gain. Equity in (loss) income of unconsolidated affiliates. Equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates in 2008 consisted primarily of a $57 million other than temporary decline in the value of our equity method investment in HSWi, coupled with $13 million in equity losses recorded during 2008, which is offset by equity in income from our joint ventures in Canada and Japan. In 2007, we recognized $9 million of equity in income primarily from our joint ventures in Canada and Japan. Interest expense, net. On May 14, 2007, we entered into a $1.5 billion term loan in conjunction with the transaction with Cox Communications Holdings, Inc., offset by a $180 million payment for a senior note that matured. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007 is primarily a result of the term loan. Other, net. Other, net includes our other non operating income net of non operating expenses, as well as, unrealized losses from derivative instruments. Other non operating income consisted of a $47 million reduction of a liability related to the value of shares in HSWi to be exchanged to its former shareholders, which was recorded in December 2008. Offsetting this non operating income is unrealized losses from derivative transactions. Unrealized losses from derivative transactions relate primarily to our use of derivative instruments to modify our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our debt. These instruments include a combination of swaps, caps, collars and other structured instruments. As a result of unrealized mark to market adjustments, we recognized unrealized losses of $31 million and $9 million during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The foreign exchange hedging instruments used by us are spot, forward and option contracts. Additionally, we enter into non designated forward contracts to hedge non dollar denominated cash flows and foreign currency balances. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a more detailed discussion of our hedging activities. Income tax expense. Our effective tax rate was 47% and 36% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 differed from the federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to DHCs recognition of deferred tax expense related to its investment in DCH (net of tax benefit from intangible amortization related to the spin off of the Travel Channel in 2007), which is partially offset by the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of Ascent Media Sound, Inc. Other items impacting the effective tax rate include the following: our conversion from deducting foreign taxes to claiming foreign tax credits, foreign unrecognized tax positions, and other miscellaneous items. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 was not materially different than the federal income tax rate of 35%. However, during this period we benefited from the tax free treatment of the gain recognized on the disposition of the Travel Channel and the release of Travel Channel deferred tax liabilities, offset by the tax impact of discontinued operations. Minority interests, net of tax. Minority interests primarily represent our and consolidated entities portion of earnings which are allocable to the minority partners, as well as the increases and decreases in the estimated redemption value of redeemable interests in subsidiaries. The increase in minority interest during the year ended December 31, 2008 is primarily a result of our increased profits allocated to minority partners prior to the Newhouse Transaction and reporting of our financial results in accordance with ARB 51. 45 Table of Contents Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes. Summarized financial information included in discontinued operations is as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2008 As Adjusted % Change (Amounts in millions) Revenues from discontinued operations: Retail stores $ $ 58 % AMC 484 631 24 % Loss from the operations of discontinued operations before income taxes: Retail $ (99 ) % AMC (6 ) (151 ) 96 % Gains on dispositions: Retail $ % AMC 67 % Income (loss) from discontinued operations: Retail $ (99 ) % AMC 61 (151 ) NM Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax: Retail $ $ (65 ) % AMC 43 (154 ) NM On September 17, 2008, as part of the Newhouse Transaction, DHC completed the spin off to its shareholders of AMC, a subsidiary holding the cash and businesses of DHC, except for CSS, which provides sound, music, mixing, sound effects and other related services under brand names such as Sound One, POP Sound, Soundelux and Todd A O (which businesses remained with us following the completion of the Newhouse Transaction). The AMC spin off was structured such that there was no gain or loss related to the transaction. Just prior to the Newhouse Transaction, DHC sold its ownership interests in Ascent Media CANS, LLC (d/b/a AccentHealth) to AccentHealth Holdings LLC, an unaffiliated third party, for approximately $119 million in cash. It was determined that AccentHealth was a non core asset, and the sale of AccentHealth was consistent with DHCs strategy to divest non core assets. DHC recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $64 million in connection with the sale of AccentHealth, which is recorded as a component of discontinued operations. As there is no continuing involvement in the operations of AMC or AccentHealth, the financial results of their operations have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (FAS 144). 46 Table of Contents Operating Division Results As noted above, our operations are divided into three segments: U.S. Networks, International Networks and Commerce, Education, and Other. Corporate expenses primarily consist of corporate functions, executive management and administrative support services. Corporate expenses are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate business segment performance based upon decisions made directly by business segment executives. Operating results exclude LTIP expense, restructuring amounts, impairments, and operating gains, consistent with our segment reporting. See Note 24.

Accordingly, DCHs 2007 results of operations do not include Travel Channel after May 14, 2007. The disposal of Travel Channel does not meet the requirements for discontinued operations presentation. The following table represents U.S. Networks results of operations excluding Travel Channel for all periods. Although this presentation is not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe this presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the U.S. Networks results of operations and allows the reader to better understand the U.S. Networks ongoing operations. 47 Table of Contents U.S. Networks without Travel Channel Years Ended December 31, 2007 2008 As Adjusted % Change (Amounts in millions) Revenues: Distribution $ 927 $ 840 10 % Advertising 1,058 975 9 % Other 77 64 20 % Total revenues $ 2,062 $ 1,879 10 % Operating costs and expenses: Cost of revenues $ 509 $ 673 (24 )% Selling, general and administrative 476 447 6 % Total operating costs and expenses $ 985 $ 1,120 (12 )% Since the disposal of Travel Channel in 2007 did not meet the requirements of discontinued operations presentation, and the results of Travel Channel are not consolidated with DCH post transaction, the following discussion excludes the results of Travel Channel for all periods so as to facilitate comparability of the U.S. Networks segment data. Revenue. Total revenue increased $183 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007. Distribution revenue increased $87 million over the period, driven by annual contractual rate increases for fully distributed networks combined with subscription units, principally from networks carried on the digital tier. Distribution revenue includes a one time $8 million adjustment resulting from improvements in our methodology of estimating accrued revenue for certain distribution operators. The adjustment was recorded in its entirety in the second quarter of 2008 and is not material to the current or prior periods. Contra revenue items included in distribution revenue, such as launch amortization and marketing consideration, decreased $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007. This decrease includes $3 million for replacement decoder boxes to support the digitization of an analog transponder recorded as contra revenue in the second quarter of 2007. Advertising revenue increased $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher pricing in the up front and scatter markets, as well as higher cash sellouts, which were partially offset by under delivery of committed audience levels, when compared with the corresponding prior year periods. Other revenue increased $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily from our representation of the Travel Channel, which increased $11 million during the period, coupled with an increase of $5 million in revenue from How Stuff Works, which was acquired in December 2007. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $6 million of international program sales revenue, which is now reported in the International Networks segment. Cost of revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cost of revenue decreased $164 million when compared with 2007, primarily due to a decrease in content amortization expense of $156 million. The decrease in content amortization expense was primarily a result of the effect of the $129 million content impairment charge recorded in 2007 following a change in management and related changes in strategy. This charge coupled with the related $76 million decrease in content amortization expense was offset by $17 million of content impairment charges for TLC programs following a change in management and related changes in strategy in the second half of 2008, and content amortization expense for new programming on Discovery Channel, TLC, Planet Green and Science Channel. Selling, general administrative expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007, which was primarily a result 48 Table of Contents of a $34 million increase in personnel costs, primarily driven by continued investment in digital media, including acquisitions made during the third and fourth quarters of 2007. This increase was partially offset by decreased marketing expense of $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with the corresponding prior year period.

Total revenue increased $128 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007, driven by an increase in distribution revenue of $98 million. Distribution revenue increased $76 million in EMEA, Latin America, and Asia primarily as a result of a 16% increase in average paying subscription units. In addition, foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $13 million on distribution revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007. Advertising revenue increased $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007. Advertising revenue increased $42 million in EMEA and Latin America primarily due to higher viewership combined with an increased subscriber base in most markets worldwide. These increases were offset by a $35 million decrease in the U.K. due to an interpretation of a contract provision resulting in a limitation in our ability to monetize our audience in the U.K., as well as, a deterioration in market conditions. Advertising revenue decreased $4 million due to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Other revenue increased $24 million mainly due to improvement in licensing and sales of programs primarily in the U.K. offset by a $2 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007, driven by a $40 million increase in content amortization expense due to continued investment in original productions and language customization to support additional local feeds for growth in local ad sales partially offset by favorable foreign exchange of $10 million and a reduction in sales commissions of $5 million. Selling general administrative expenses. Selling, general administrative expenses decreased $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007. This decrease was driven by a $26 million reduction in marketing expenditures coupled with the favorable impact of $3 million from foreign exchange. 49 Table of Contents Commerce, Education, and Other Years Ended December 31, 2007 2008 As Adjusted % Change (Amounts in millions) Total revenues $ 196 $ 225 (13 )% Operating costs and expenses: Cost of revenues $ 116 $ 151 (23 )% Selling, general and administrative 67 70 (4 )% Total operating costs and expenses $ 183 $ 221 (17 )% Revenue. Commerce, Education, and Other total revenue decreased $29 million for the year ended 2008 when compared with the prior year. A challenging retail environment in 2008 coupled with the success of the Planet Earth DVD in 2007 contributed to a year over year decline of 48% in revenue from the direct to consumer business, which was partially offset by higher licensing revenue. Education revenue increased by $6 million as the core streaming business continued to grow. New revenue streams in licensing and sponsorships were slightly offset by the decline in the hardcopy business as customers shifted to our digital services. Revenues generated by the CSS business were relatively flat compared with 2007. Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue decreased $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, commensurate with the decrease in Commerces product revenue coupled with a decrease in Educations content amortization, which resulted from the fourth quarter 2007 write off of capitalized content costs that were not aligned with Educations product offerings. Selling, general administrative expenses. Selling, general administrative expenses decreased $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower personnel and marketing costs incurred in Commerce and Education coupled with a $2 million legal expense in 2007 for a legal settlement. These decreases were partially offset by a slight increase in selling, general and administrative expense from the CSS business.

Consistent with our segment reporting, corporate expenses are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate business segment performance based upon decisions made directly by business segment executives. Corporate revenue increased $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007, primarily due to increased ancillary revenue from a joint venture, whose primary sales were of the Planet Earth DVD; current sales volume is not expected to continue. Corporate costs increased $32 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008, driven by increased costs incurred in conjunction with our preparing to become a public entity as a result of the Newhouse Transaction and costs related to the start up of OWN. 50 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2007 vs. 2006 Prior to the Newhouse Transaction, our consolidated results of operations included 100% of AMCs results of operations, general and administrative expenses incurred at the DHC corporate level, as well as DHCs share of earnings of DCH. The Statement of Operations reflects the CSS business in revenue and operating costs and expenses, whereas the portion of AMCs businesses that were spun off as a result of the Newhouse Transaction are reflected in Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax.

Generally, these services pertain to the completion of feature films, television programs and advertisements. These projects normally span from a few days to three months or more in length, and fees for these projects typically range from less than $1,000 to $200,000. Expenses related to the corporate support from DHC are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. Cost of services and operating expenses consists primarily of production wages, facility costs and other direct costs. Revenue. Revenue for CSS decreased $4 million to $76 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, when compared with the same period in 2006. This decrease was driven by smaller feature sound projects and the shut down of certain audio facilities in 2006. Total operating costs and expenses. Total operating costs and expenses decreased $7 million to $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, when compared with the same period in 2006. This decrease was driven by the reduction of costs that resulted from the shut down of certain audio facilities and related selling, general and administrative expenses. Equity in earnings of Discovery Communications Holding, LLC. From January 1, 2006 through May 14, 2007, DHC recorded its 50% share of the earnings of DCH. Subsequent to May 14, 2007 and prior to 51 Table of Contents September 17, 2008, the date the Newhouse Transaction closed, DHC recorded its 662/3% share of the earnings of DCH. DHCs share of earnings in DCH increased $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, when compared with the same period in 2006. This increase resulted from DHCs $90 million share of DCHs gain on the Cox Transaction, along with an $8 million increase due to DHCs increase in share ownership in DCH from 50% to 662/3%. These increases were partially offset by higher long term incentive compensation expense for DCH personnel and higher interest at DCH as a result of debt incurred to close the Cox Transaction. Net loss from Discontinued Operations. The net loss from discontinued operations increased $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, from the comparable period in 2006, primarily as a result of a $72 million increase in charges related to the impairment of goodwill on the AMC business for the year ended December 31, 2007, when compared with the same period in 2006. The increase in goodwill impairment charges was partially offset by an improvement in operating performance on the AMC business. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table represents a comparison of the components of the statement of cash flows, as reported for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, with a reconciliation of historical DCH statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our as adjusted statement of cash flows represents the cash flow activities as if the Newhouse Transaction was completed January 1, 2007. The table includes the cash flow activity for AMC for both periods, including cash provided by operating activities of $28 million, cash provided by investing activities of $128 million, and cash used in financing activities of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. AMC cash provided by operating activities was $61 million, cash used in investing activities was $15 million, and cash provided by financing activities was $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. 52 Table of Contents For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 For the Year For the Year Ended Ended December 31, DHC Discovery December 31, 2008 As reported DCH as Adjusted 2006 (Amounts in millions) Operating Activities Net income (loss) $ 317 $ (68 ) $ $ (68 ) $ (46 ) Adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to cash provided by operating activities: 568 139 459 598 100 Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of discontinued operations: (316 ) (13 ) (217 ) (230 ) 19 Cash provided by operating activities 569 58 242 300 73 Investing Activities Purchases of property and equipment (102 ) (47 ) (81 ) (128 ) (77 ) Proceeds from business and asset dispositions 139 2 2 6 Net cash acquired from Newhouse Transaction 45 Business acquisitions, net of cash acquired (8 ) (306 ) (306 ) (47 ) Purchases of securities (52 ) Proceeds from sale of securities 24 28 28 Other investing activities, net 2 (44 ) (42 ) 1 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 98 (15 ) (431 ) (446 ) (169 ) Financing Activities Ascent Media Corporation spin off (356 ) Borrowings from long term debt 1,500 1,500 Net repayments of revolver loans (125 ) (2 ) (2 ) Principal repayments of long term debt (257 ) (8 ) (8 ) Principal repayments of capital lease obligations (29 ) (6 ) (6 ) Repurchase of members interests (1,285 ) (1,285 ) Net cash from stock option exercises 13 13 Other financing activities, net (7 ) (1 ) (24 ) (25 ) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities (774 ) 12 175 187 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (2 ) 7 7 Change in cash and cash equivalents (109 ) 55 (7 ) 48 (96 ) Cash and cash equivalents of continuing operations, beginning of period 1 52 53 Cash and cash equivalents of discontinued operations, beginning of period 209 153 153 250 Adjustment to remove AMC cash (201 ) (201 ) Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 100 $ 8 $ 45 $ 53 $ 154 The DHC amounts are reported net of adjustments of $222 million for net income, $142 million to eliminate the DHC equity pick up of DCH, and $80 million to allocate minority interest to Advance/Newhouse. Sources of Cash Our principal sources of liquidity are cash in hand, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. We anticipate that our cash flows from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. 53 Table of Contents Total Liquidity at December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008 we had approximately $1.3 billion of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $100 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow approximately $1.2 billion under our revolving credit facilities. In October 2008, we repaid $11 million outstanding under our U.K. revolving credit facility. This facility was closed at our election in December 2008 and would have expired according to its terms in April 2009. Cash Provided by Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2008, our cash provided by operating activities was $569 million compared to $300 million for the same period as adjusted in 2007. Proceeds from the sale of business. During the year ended December 31, 2008, AMC received proceeds of $139 million primarily from the sale of Accent Health as part of the spin off of AMC. Debt Facilities. Our committed debt facilities include two term loans, a revolving loan facility and various senior notes payable. The second term loan was entered into on May 14, 2007 for $1.5 billion in connection with the Cox Transaction. Total commitments of these facilities were $4.9 billion at December 31, 2008. Debt outstanding on these facilities aggregated $3.7 billion at December 31, 2008, providing excess debt availability of $1.2 billion. We currently have fixed the interest rate on the majority of our outstanding debt. The anticipated interest payments, together with the scheduled principal payments, due over the next year are within the available capacity on our committed facilities. Although we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations and to meet our debt service obligations over the next 12 months, we may seek to arrange new financing in the current year in advance of the maturity of our debt facility in 2010. Also, our current performance on the leverage and other financial maintenance tests is at levels within the established thresholds of the debt agreements indicating some ability to absorb lower than expected operating results and still remain within the covenant limits. DCHs $1.5 billion term loan is secured by its assets, excluding assets held by its subsidiaries. The remaining term loan, revolving loan and senior notes are unsecured. The debt facilities contain covenants that require the respective borrowers to meet certain financial ratios and place restrictions on the payment of dividends, sale of assets, additional borrowings, mergers, and purchases of capital stock, assets and investments. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2008. Our interest expense associated with our debt facilities is exposed to movements in short term interest rates. Derivative instruments, including both fixed to variable and variable to fixed interest rate instruments, are used to modify this exposure. The variable to fixed interest rate instruments have a notional principal amount of $2.3 billion and have a weighted average interest rate of 4.68% against 3 month LIBOR at December 31, 2008. The fixed to variable interest rate agreements have a notional principal amount of $50 million and have a weighted average interest rate of 7.90% against fixed rate private placement debt at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, we held an unexercised interest rate swap put with a notional amount of $25 million at a fixed rate of 5.44%. On January 29, 2009, we entered into interest rate swap transactions which will become effective on June 30, 2010, with a notional amount of $200 million. Under the swap transactions, we will make quarterly payments at a rate of approximately 2.935% per annum to the swap counterparties in exchange for a payment approximately equal to the variable rate payable under our Credit, Pledge and Security Agreement dated as of May 14, 2007. The swap transactions terminate on March 31, 2014, which is the interest payment date before the maturity date of our Credit, Pledge and Security Agreement, which is May 14, 2014. The terms of the swap transactions are governed by customary ISDA interest rate swap agreements. By entering into these swap transactions, we have effectively fixed the interest rate on $200 million of the borrowings under its Credit, Pledge and Security Agreement at approximately 4.935% per annum, starting as of June 30, 2010. Uses of Cash During the year ended December 31, 2008, our primary uses of cash were cash payments for content of $803 million, mandatory principal payments under our bank facilities and senior notes totaling $257 million, 54 Table of Contents cash payments of $125 million under our revolving loans, capital expenditures of $102 million, and payments under our LTIP of $49 million. During the year ended December 31, 2007, on an as adjusted basis, our primary uses of cash were the redemption of Coxs equity interests of $1.3 billion, cash payments for content of $706 million and capital expenditures of $127 million. In 2009, we expect our uses of cash to be approximately $445 million for debt repayments, $225 million for interest expense, and $60 million for capital expenditures. We have no material commitments for capital expenditures. We will also be required to make payments under our LTIP as well as for stock appreciation rights issued under our Incentive Plan. Amounts expensed and payable under the LTIP are dependent on future annual calculations of unit values which are primarily affected by changes in our stock price, changes in units outstanding, and changes to the plan. Joint Venture Arrangement. On June 19, 2008, we entered in to a 50 50 joint venture with Oprah Winfrey and Harpo, Inc. (Harpo) to rebrand Discovery Health Channel as OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN Network). It is expected that Discovery Health will be rebranded as OWN in late 2009 or early 2010. Pursuant to the agreement, we have committed to make capital contributions of up to $100 million through September 30, 2011, of which $6 million has been funded as of December 31, 2008. We anticipate that a significant portion of the $100 million funding obligation will occur in 2009. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity If we were to experience a significant decline in operating performance, or have to meet an unanticipated need for additional liquidity beyond our available commitments, there is no certainty that we would be able to access the needed liquidity. While we have established relationships with U.S. and international banks and investors which continue to participate in our various credit agreements, the current tightening in the credit markets may cause some lenders to have to reduce or withdraw their commitments if we were to seek to negotiate a refinancing or an increase in our total commitments. Covenants in existing debt agreements may constrain our capacity for additional debt or there may be significant increases in costs to refinance existing debt to access additional liquidity. As a public company, we may have access to other sources of capital such as the public bond and equity markets. However, access to sufficient liquidity in these markets is not assured given our substantial debt outstanding and the continued volatility in the equity markets and further tightening in the credit markets. Our access to capital markets can be affected by factors outside of our control. In addition, our cost to borrow is impacted by market conditions and our financial performance as measured by certain credit metrics defined in our credit agreements, including interest coverage and leverage ratios. Contractual Obligations We have agreements covering leases of satellite transponders, facilities and equipment. These agreements expire at various dates through 2028. We are obligated to license programming under agreements with content suppliers that expire over various dates. We also have other contractual commitments arising in the ordinary course of business. 55 Table of Contents A summary of all of the expected payments for these commitments as well as future principal payments under the current debt arrangements and minimum payments under capital leases at December 31, 2008 is as follows: Payments Due by Period(1) Less than 1 More than Total Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt $ 3,721 445 1,128 355 1,793 Interest payments(2) 735 217 274 179 65 Capital leases 82 18 34 20 10 Operating leases 359 66 105 73 115 Content 538 354 102 82 Other(3) 394 101 115 41 137 Total $ 5,829 1,201 1,758 750 2,120 (1) Table does not include certain long term obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as the timing of the payments cannot be predicted or the amounts will not be settled in cash. The most significant of these obligations is the $23 million accrued under our LTIP plans. In addition, amounts accrued in our consolidated balance sheet related to derivative financial instruments are not included in the table as such amounts may not be settled in cash or the timing of the payments cannot be predicted. (2) Amounts (i) are based on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2008, (ii) assume the interest rates on our floating rate debt remain constant at the December 31, 2008 rates and (iii) assume that our existing debt is repaid at maturity. (3) Represents our obligations to purchase goods and services whereby the underlying agreements are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. The more significant purchase obligations include: obligations to purchase goods and services, employment contracts, sponsorship agreements and transmission services. We are subject to a contractual agreement that may require us to acquire the minority interest of certain of our subsidiaries. The amount and timing of such payments are not currently known. We have recorded a $49 million liability as of December 31, 2008 for this redemption right. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. Critical accounting policies impact the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates. An appreciation of our critical accounting policies facilitates an understanding of our financial results. Amounts disclosed relate to Discovery, as adjusted for 2007 and Discovery for 2008. Unless otherwise noted, we applied critical accounting policies and estimates methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. For further information regarding these critical accounting policies and estimates, please see the Notes to our consolidated financial statements. Revenue We derive revenue from (i) distribution revenue from cable systems, satellite operators and other distributors, (ii) advertising aired on our networks and websites, and (iii) other, which is largely e commerce and educational sales. 56 Table of Contents Distribution. Distributors generally pay a per subscriber fee for the right to distribute our programming under the terms of long term distribution contracts (distribution revenue). Distribution revenue is reported net of incentive costs or other consideration, if any, offered to system operators in exchange for long term distribution contracts. We recognize distribution revenue over the term of the contracts based on contracted monthly license fee provisions and reported subscriber levels. Network incentives have historically included upfront cash incentives referred to as launch support in connection with the launch of a network by the distributor within certain time frames. Any such amounts are capitalized as assets upon launch of our programming by the distributor and are amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction of revenue over the terms of the contracts. In instances where the distribution agreement is extended prior to the expiration of the original term, we evaluate the economics of the extended term and, if it is determined that the deferred launch asset continues to benefit us over the extended term, then we will adjust the launch amortization period accordingly. Other incentives are recognized as a reduction of revenue as incurred. The amount of distribution revenue due to us is reported by distributors based on actual subscriber levels. Such information is generally not received until after the close of the reporting period. Therefore, reported distribution revenue is based upon our estimates of the number of subscribers receiving our programming for the month, plus an adjustment for the prior month estimate. Our subscriber estimates are based on the most recent remittance or confirmation of subscribers received from the distributor. Advertising. We record advertising revenue net of agency commissions and audience deficiency liabilities in the period advertising spots are broadcast. A substantial portion of the advertising sold in the United States includes guaranteed levels of audience that either the program or the advertisement will reach. Deferred revenue is recorded and adjusted as the guaranteed audience levels are achieved. Audience guarantees are initially developed by our internal research group and actual audience and delivery information is provided by third party ratings services. In certain instances, the third party ratings information is not received until after the close of the reporting period. In these cases, reported advertising revenue and related deferred revenue is based on our estimates for any under delivery of contracted advertising ratings based on the most current data available from the third party ratings service. Differences between the estimated under delivery and the actual under delivery have historically been insignificant. Online advertising revenues are recognized as impressions are delivered. Certain of our advertising arrangements include deliverables in addition to commercial time, such as the advertisers product integration into the programming, customized vignettes, and billboards. These contracts that include other deliverables are evaluated as multiple element revenue arrangements under EITF 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Commerce, Education, and Other. Commerce revenue is recognized upon product shipment, net of estimated returns, which are not material to our consolidated financial statements. Educational service sales are generally recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. CSS services revenue is recognized when services are performed. Revenue from post production and certain distribution related services is recognized when services are provided. Prepayments received for services to be performed at a later date are deferred. Derivative Financial Instruments Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, (FAS 133), requires every derivative instrument to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as either an asset or a liability. The statement also requires that changes in the fair value of derivatives be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. We use financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges. The effective changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as interest expense is recorded for debt. We use the cumulative dollar offset method to assess effectiveness. To be highly effective, the ratio calculated by dividing the cumulative change in the value of the actual swap by the cumulative change in the hypothetical swap must be between 80% and 125%. The ineffective portion of a derivatives change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. We use derivative instruments principally to manage the risk associated 57 Table of Contents with the movements of foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates that will affect the cash flows of our debt transactions. Refer to Note 12 for additional information regarding derivative instruments held by us and risk management strategies. Content Rights Costs incurred in the direct production, co production or licensing of content rights are capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost, fair value, or net realizable value. In accordance with SOP 00 2, Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films, we amortize our content assets based upon the ratio of current revenue to total estimated revenue (ultimate revenue). To determine this ratio, we analyze historical and projected usage for similar programming and apply such usage factors to projected revenue by network adjusted for any future significant programming strategy changes. The result of this policy is an accelerated amortization pattern for the fully distributed U.S. Networks segment (Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet) and Discovery Channel in the International Networks segment over a period of no more than four years. The accelerated amortization pattern results in the amortization of approximately 40% to 50% of the program cost during the first year. Topical or current events programming is amortized over shorter periods based on the nature of the programming and may be expensed upon its initial airing. All other networks in the U.S. Networks segment and International Networks segment utilize up to five year useful life. For these networks, with programming investment levels lower than the established networks and higher reuse of programming, straight line amortization is considered a reasonable estimate of the use of content consistent with the pace of earning ultimate revenue. Ultimate revenue assessments include advertising and affiliate revenue streams. Ancillary revenue is considered immaterial to the assessment. Changes in managements assumptions, such as changes in expected use, could significantly alter our estimates for amortization. Amortization is approximately $658 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and the unamortized programming balance at December 31, 2008 is $1.2 billion. Programming that we expect to alter planned use by reduction or removal from a network because of changes in network strategy is written down to its net realizable value based on adjusted ultimate revenues when identified. On a periodic basis, management evaluates the net realizable value of content in conjunction with our strategic review of the business. Changes in managements assumptions, such as changes in expected use, could significantly alter our estimates for write offs. During the third quarter 2008, we implemented significant changes in brand strategies for TLC. As a result, we recorded a content impairment charge of $17 million, which is included as a component of content amortization expense. Consolidated content impairment, including accelerated amortization of certain programs is approximately $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Expenses Arising from Long Term Incentive Plans Expenses arising from liability awards based on long term incentive plans are primarily related to our unit based, long term incentive plan (LTIP), for our employees who meet certain eligibility criteria. Units were awarded to eligible employees and vest at a rate of 25% per year. Prior to the Newhouse Transaction, we accounted for the LTIP in accordance with FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and EITF 02 08, Accounting for Options Granted to Employees in Unrestricted, Publicly Traded Shares of an Unrelated Entity, as the value of units in the LTIP was indexed to the value of DHC Series A common stock. Upon redemption of the LTIP awards, participants received a cash payment based on the difference between the market price of DHC Series A common stock on the vesting date and the market price on the date of grant. Following the Newhouse Transaction, units remained outstanding and were adjusted to track changes in the value of our publicly traded stock. We account for these cash settled stock appreciation awards in accordance with FAS 123(R), Share Based Payment. The value of units in the LTIP is calculated using the Black Scholes model each reporting period, and the change in unit value of LTIP awards outstanding is recorded as compensation expense over the period outstanding. We elected to attribute expense for the units in accordance with FAS 123R. We use volatility of 58 Table of Contents DHC common stock or our common stock, if available, in our Black Scholes models. However, if the term of the units is in excess of the period common stock has been outstanding, we use a combination of historical and implied volatility. Different assumptions could result in different market valuations. However the most significant factor in determining the unit value is the price of common stock. Goodwill and Indefinite lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. Our 2008 annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter, did not result in any impairment charges. However, over the past year, the decline in our stock price suggests in a lower estimated fair value for each of our reporting units. As a result of this decline, the estimated fair value of the U.K. reporting unit approximates its carrying value. Accordingly, future declines in estimated fair values may result in goodwill impairment charges. It is possible that such charges, if required, could be recorded prior to the fourth quarter of 2009 (i.e., during an interim period) if our stock price, our results of operations, or other factors require such assets to be tested for impairment at an interim date. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. In performing the first step, we determine the fair value of a reporting unit by using two valuation techniques: a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and a market based approach. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the DCF analyses are based on our budget and long term business plan. In assessing the reasonableness of its determined fair values, we evaluate our results against other value indicators such as comparable company public trading values, research analyst estimates and values observed in market transactions. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is required to be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill and non amortizing trademarks. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. In other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The estimates of fair value of intangible assets not subject to amortization are determined using a DCF valuation analysis. Long lived Assets Long lived assets (e.g., amortizing trademarks, customer lists, other intangibles and property, plant and equipment) do not require that an annual impairment test be performed; instead, long lived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Triggering events include the likely (i.e., more likely than not) disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. If the intent is to hold the asset for continued use, the impairment test first requires a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows against the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset would be deemed to be impaired. Impairment would then be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by discounting the future cash flows associated with that asset. If the intent is to hold the asset for sale and certain other 59 Table of Contents criteria are met (e.g., the asset can be disposed of currently, appropriate levels of authority have approved the sale, and there is an active program to locate a buyer), the impairment test involves comparing the assets carrying value to its fair value. To the extent the carrying value is greater than the assets fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred, determining the future cash flows for the assets involved and determining the proper discount rate to be applied in determining fair value. In 2007, there were no significant long lived asset impairments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded long lived asset impairments of $30 million for HSW and $2 million for exit costs of certain operations. The determination of recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles and long lived assets requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future cash flows, fair values, and the appropriate grouping of assets. Such estimates are subject to change and could result in impairment losses being recognized in the future. If different reporting units, asset groupings, or different valuation methodologies had been used, the impairment test results could have differed. Deferred Launch Incentives Consideration issued to cable and satellite distributors in connection with the execution of long term network distribution agreements is deferred and amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction to revenue over the terms of the agreements. Obligations for fixed launch incentives are recorded at the inception of the agreement. Following the renewal of a distribution agreement, the remaining deferred consideration is amortized over the extended period. Amortization of deferred launch incentives was $75 million and $100 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2007, in connection with the settlement of terms under a pre existing distribution agreement, we completed negotiations for the renewal of long term distribution agreements for certain of our U.K. networks and paid a distributor $196 million, most of which is being amortized over a five year period. Redeemable Interests in Subsidiaries For those instruments with an estimated redemption value, redeemable interests in subsidiaries are accreted or amortized to an estimated redemption value ratably over the period to the redemption date. Accretion and amortization are recorded as a component of minority interest expense. Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will be unrealized. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In instances where we have taken or expect to take a tax position in its tax return and we believe it is more likely than not that such tax position will be upheld by the relevant taxing authority upon settlement, we may record the benefits of such tax position in our consolidated financial statements. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The adoption of FIN 48 did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP No. EITF 03 6 1). This FSP provides that all outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to non forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are 60 Table of Contents considered participating securities. Because such awards are considered participating securities, the issuing entity is required to apply the two class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. The provisions of FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 will be effective for us on January 1, 2009, and will be applied retrospectively to all prior period earnings per share computations. The adoption of FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 will not have a material impact on our earnings per share amounts. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP 142 3), which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset pursuant to FAS No. 142. The provisions of FSP 142 3 will be effective for us on January 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact that the provisions of FSP 142 3 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, as amended (FAS 161). FAS No. 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133), to include information about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FAS 133 and its related interpretations; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The provisions of FAS 161 will be effective for us on January 1, 2009. The adoption of FAS 161 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141R). This Statement requires, among other things, that companies: (1) expense business acquisition transaction costs, which are presently included in the cost of the acquisition, (2) record an asset for in process research and development, which is presently expensed at the time of the acquisition, (3) record at fair value amounts for contingencies, including contingent consideration, as of the purchase date with subsequent adjustments recognized in operations, which is presently accounted for as an adjustment of purchase price, (4) recognize decreases in valuation allowances on acquired deferred tax assets in operations, which were are presently considered to be subsequent changes in consideration and are recorded as decreases in goodwill, and (5) measure at fair value any non controlling interest in the acquiree. The provisions of FAS 141R will be effective for us on January 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively to new business combinations consummated on or subsequent to the effective date. Generally, the effects of FAS 141R will depend on future acquisitions. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (FAS 160). FAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary, commonly referred to as minority interest. Among other matters, FAS 160 requires that non controlling interests be reported within equity in the balance sheet and that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interest to be clearly presented in the statement of income. The provisions of FAS 160 will be effective for us on January 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which shall be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of FAS 160 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 07 1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements (EITF 07 1). EITF 07 1 defines collaborative arrangements and establishes accounting and reporting requirements for transactions between participants in the arrangement and third parties. A collaborative arrangement is a contractual arrangement that involves a joint operating activity, for example an agreement to co produce and distribute programming with another media company. The provisions of EITF 07 1 will be effective for us on January 1, 2009, and will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact that EITF 07 1 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We continually monitor our economic exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates and may enter into foreign exchange agreements where and when appropriate. Substantially all of our foreign transactions are denominated in foreign currencies, including the liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries. Although our foreign transactions are not generally subject to significant foreign exchange transaction gains or losses, the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars as part of our consolidated financial reporting. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations. Our earnings and cash flow are exposed to market risk and can be affected by, among other things, economic conditions, interest rate changes, and foreign currency fluctuations. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. We use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long term debt are expected to vary as a result of future requirements, market conditions and other factors. Our interest expense is exposed to movements in short term interest rates. Derivative instruments, including both fixed to variable and variable to fixed interest rate instruments, are used to modify this exposure. These instruments include swaps and swaptions to modify interest rate exposure. The variable to fixed interest rate instruments had a notional principal amount of $2.3 billion and a weighted average interest rate of 4.68% at December 31, 2008 for us and December 31, 2007 for DCH. The fixed to variable interest rate agreements had a notional principal amount of $50 million and $225 million and had a weighted average interest rate of 7.90% and 9.65% at December 31, 2008 for us and December 31, 2007 for DCH, respectively. At December 31, 2008, we held an unexercised interest rate swap put with a notional amount of $25 million at a fixed rate of 5.44%. The fair value of these derivative instruments, which aggregate ($106) million and ($50) million at December 31, 2008 for us and December 31, 2007 for DCH, respectively, is recorded as a component of long term liabilities and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Of the total of $2.9 billion principal amount, a notional amount of $2 billion of these derivative instruments are highly effective cash flow hedges. The value of these hedges at December 31, 2008 was ($71) million with changes in the mark to market value recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. Should any portion of these instruments become ineffective due to a restructuring in our debt, the monthly changes in fair value would be reported as a component of other income on the Statement of Operations. We do not expect material hedge ineffectiveness in the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2008, a parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve equal to one percentage point would change the fair value of our interest rate derivative portfolio by approximately $49 million. In addition, a change of one percentage point in interest rates on variable rate debt would impact interest expense by approximately $6 million on a yearly basis. Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow. Accordingly, we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments that change in value as foreign exchange rates change. The foreign exchange instruments used are spot, forward, and option contracts. Additionally, we enter into non designated forward contracts to hedge non dollar denominated cash flows and foreign currency balances. At December 31, 2008 for us, and December 31, 2007 for DCH, the notional amount of foreign exchange derivative contracts was $75 million and $174 million, respectively. The fair value of these derivative instruments is recorded as a component of long term liabilities and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. These derivative instruments did not receive hedge accounting treatment. As of December 31, 2008, an estimated 10% adverse movement in exchange rates against the US dollar would decrease the fair value of our portfolio by approximately $5 million. We continually monitor our positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments and do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. In addition, we limit the amount of investment credit exposure with any one institution. 62 Table of Contents
