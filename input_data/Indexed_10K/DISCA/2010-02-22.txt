BUSINESS OVERVIEW We are a leading global media and entertainment company that provides original and purchased programming across multiple distribution platforms in the U.S. and over 170 other countries, including over 100 television networks offering customized programming in 38 languages. Our strategy is to optimize the distribution, ratings and profit potential of each of our branded channels. Additionally, we own and operate a diversified portfolio of website properties and other digital services and develop and sell consumer and educational products as well as media sound services in the U.S. and internationally. Our media content is designed to target key audience demographics and the popularity of our programming creates a reason for advertisers to purchase commercial time on our channels. Audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators, direct to home (DTH) satellite operators and other content distributors to deliver our programming to their customers. In addition to growing distribution and advertising revenue for our branded channels, we are focused on extending content distribution across new distribution platforms, including brand aligned web properties, mobile devices, video on demand and broadband channels, which provide promotional platforms for our television programming and serve as additional outlets for advertising and affiliate sales. We also operate websites including HowStuffWorks.com, Petfinder.com and Treehugger.com that provide supplemental news, information and entertainment aligned with our television programming. 30 Table of Contents We were formed in connection with Discovery Holding Company (DHC) and Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership (Advance/Newhouse) combining their respective ownership interests in Discovery Communications Holding, LLC (DCH) and exchanging those interests with and into Discovery, which was consummated on September 17, 2008 (the Newhouse Transaction). Prior to the Newhouse Transaction, DCH was a stand alone private company, which was owned approximately 66 2/3% by DHC and 33 1/3% by Advance/Newhouse. The Newhouse Transaction was completed as follows: On September 17, 2008, DHC completed the spin off to its shareholders of Ascent Media Corporation (AMC), a subsidiary holding the cash and businesses of DHC except for certain businesses that provide sound, music, mixing, sound effects, and other related services (the AMC spin off). Such businesses remain with us following the completion of the Newhouse Transaction. On September 17, 2008, immediately following the AMC spin off, DHC merged with a transitory merger subsidiary of Discovery, with DHCs existing shareholders receiving common stock of Discovery; and On September 17, 2008, immediately following the exchange of shares between Discovery and DHC, Advance/Newhouse contributed its interests in DCH and Animal Planet to Discovery in exchange for shares of Discoverys Series A and Series C convertible preferred stock that are convertible at any time into our common stock, which at the transaction date represented one third of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result of the Newhouse Transaction, DHC and DCH became wholly owned subsidiaries of Discovery, with Discovery becoming the successor reporting entity to DHC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Pursuant to guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on issues relating to accounting for business combinations, for accounting purposes the Newhouse Transaction was treated as a non substantive merger, and therefore, the Newhouse Transaction was recorded at the investors historical bases. Refer to Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further description of the Newhouse Transaction. We manage and report our operations in three segments: U.S. Networks; International Networks; and Commerce, Education, and Other. U.S. Networks U.S. Networks is our largest segment, which owns and operates 11 cable and satellite channels primarily throughout the U.S. including Discovery Channel, TLC, and Animal Planet, as well as a portfolio of website properties and other digital services. The segments channels are wholly owned except for Discovery Kids, which is operated through a 50 50 joint venture between us and Hasbro, Inc. Currently, we own and operate the Discovery Health Channel. However, pursuant to our joint venture arrangement with Harpo, Inc. for the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), we will contribute our interest in the Discovery Health Channel to OWN, which is expected to occur in 2011. U.S. Networks derives revenues primarily from distribution fees and advertising sales, which comprised 46% and 51%, respectively, of revenues for this segment for the year ended December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, Discovery Channel, TLC, and Animal Planet collectively generated 77% of U.S. Networks total revenues. U.S. Networks earns distribution fees under multi year affiliation agreements with cable operators, DTH satellite operators, and other distributors of television programming. Distribution fees are based on the number of subscribers receiving our programming. Upon the launch of a new channel, we may initially pay distributors to carry such channel (such payments are referred to as launch incentives), or may provide the channel to the distributor for free for a predetermined length of time. Launch incentives are amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction of revenues over the term of the affiliation agreement. U.S. Networks generates advertising revenues by selling commercial time on our networks and websites. The number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our programming, and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels are key drivers of advertising revenue. U.S. Networks largest single cost is the cost of programming, including production costs for original programming. U.S. Networks amortizes the cost of original or purchased programming based on the expected realization of revenue, resulting in an accelerated amortization method for Discovery Channel, TLC, and Animal Planet content and straight line amortization method over a maximum of four years for the remaining networks. 31 Table of Contents International Networks International Networks manages a portfolio of channels, led by the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet brands that are distributed in virtually every pay television market in the world through an infrastructure that includes major operational centers in London, Singapore, and Miami. International Networks regional operations cover most major markets and are organized into four locally managed regional operations: the United Kingdom (U.K.); Europe (excluding the U.K.), Middle East and Africa (EMEA); Asia Pacific; and Latin America. International Networks currently operates over 100 unique distribution feeds in 38 languages with channel feeds customized according to language needs and advertising sales opportunities. Most of the segments channels are wholly owned with the exception of the international Animal Planet channels, which are generally joint ventures in which the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) owns 50%, People+Arts, which operates in Latin America and Iberia as a 50 50 joint venture with the BBC, and several channels in Japan and Canada, which operate as joint ventures with strategically important local partners. Similar to our U.S. Networks segment, the primary sources of revenues for International Networks are distribution fees and advertising sales, and the primary cost is programming. International Networks executes a localization strategy by offering shared programming with U.S. Networks, customized content, and localized schedules via our distribution feeds. For the year ended December 31, 2009, distribution revenues represented approximately 61% of the segments operating revenues. Advertising sales are increasingly important to the segments financial success, representing 29% of the segments total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009. International television markets vary in their stages of development. Some, notably the U.K., are more advanced digital multi channel television markets, while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital. In developing pay television markets, we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth, our localization strategy, and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay television. In relatively mature markets, such as the U.K., the growth dynamic is changing. Increased market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid growth in those markets. Instead, growth in advertising sales will come from increasing viewership and advertising pricing on our existing pay television networks and launching new services, either in pay television or free television environments. Commerce, Education, and Other Our commerce business engages with licensees, manufacturers, publishers and retailers to design, develop, publish, promote and sell a wide variety of products based on our intellectual property. We primarily engage in catalog sales and online distribution of products through DiscoveryStore.com. In April 2009, we completed the transition of our commerce business to a licensing model by outsourcing the commerce direct to consumer operations including our commerce website, related marketing, product development and fulfillment to a third party in exchange for royalties. The new structure for our commerce business enables us to continue offering high quality DVD programming as well as many merchandise categories leveraging both licensed and make and sell products. We expect a reduction in our year over year top line revenue contribution, as well as a reduction in direct operating expenses through the first fiscal quarter of 2010. Our education business is focused on our domestic and international direct to school K 12 online streaming distribution subscription services, as well as our professional development services for teachers, benchmark student assessment services, and publishing hardcopy content through a network of distribution channels including online, catalog and dealers. Our education business also participates in a growing sponsorship, global brand, and content licensing business with leading non profits, foundations, trade associations, and Fortune 500 companies. Other businesses primarily include sound, music, mixing sound effects, and other related services to major motion picture studios, independent producers, broadcast networks, cable channels, advertising agencies, and interactive producers. Recent Developments Accounting for Variable Interest Entities Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) statement amending the accounting for interests in a variable interest entity (VIE). Pursuant to the adoption of this statement, beginning January 1, 2010 we will no longer consolidate the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) and Animal Planet Japan (APJ) joint ventures and will account for our interest in these entities under the equity method of accounting. However, we continued to consolidate OWN and APJ through December 31, 2009. Accordingly, for the periods in which we were required to consolidate OWN and APJ under the existing accounting standards, the financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10 K includes the financial position and operating results of these entities. Beginning in 2010, we will apply the provisions of the new statement retrospectively to financial information for all periods presented. 32 Table of Contents In accordance with the existing accounting guidance that required us to consolidate OWN, half of the operating losses generated during 2009 by OWN were allocated to Harpo, Inc. (Harpo), our joint venture partner, as a component of Loss (income) attributable to non controlling interests. In connection with the change in our method of accounting for our interest in OWN from consolidation to the equity method, because of our obligation to fund OWNs operations up to $100 million we will absorb all of the joint ventures losses up to our funding commitment. Similarly, upon adoption we will record $17 million of OWNs 2009 operating losses that were previously allocated to Harpo as a component of Other non operating income (expense), net. Reportable Segments Effective January 1, 2010, we realigned the Discovery Commerce business from the Commerce, Education, and Other reporting segment into the U.S. Networks reporting segment. In connection with this realignment, we changed the name of our Commerce, Education, and Other reporting segment to Education and Other. The financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10 K has not been recast to reflect the realignment. Accordingly, the results of operations for the Discovery Commerce business are included in the financial results for the Commerce, Education, and Other segment. Beginning in 2010, we will include the Discovery Commerce business in the financial results for the U.S. Networks segment and will recast prior period results to conform to the new presentation. Hasbro Discovery Joint Venture On May 22, 2009, we formed a 50 50 joint venture with Hasbro, Inc. (Hasbro) that will operate a television network and website dedicated to high quality childrens and family entertainment and educational programming. In connection with the arrangement, Discovery contributed the U.S. Discovery Kids Network (Discovery Kids) to the joint venture. Additionally, Hasbro acquired a 50% ownership interest in the joint venture for a cash payment of $300 million and a tax receivables agreement collectible over 20 years valued at $57 million, which resulted in a total gain of $252 million. The rebranded network is scheduled to premiere in late 2010. Additional information regarding the joint venture is disclosed in Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Items Impacting Comparability Beginning May 22, 2009, we ceased to consolidate the operating results of Discovery Kids. However, as we continue to be involved in the operations of the joint venture, we have not presented the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of Discovery Kids recorded through May 21, 2009 as discontinued operations. Our interest in the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our consolidated results of operations and our U.S. Networks segment include the operating results of Discovery Kids through May 21, 2009, whereas for subsequent periods we record only our proportionate share of the joint ventures net operating results. The following table presents total revenues and operating expenses recognized by Discovery for Discovery Kids prior to deconsolidation (in millions). January 1, 2009 throughMay 21, 2009 Year Ended December 31, 2008 Revenues $ 19 $ 42 Operating costs and expenses $ 7 $ 24 Our results of operations were also impacted by the effects of consolidating OWN, beginning in July 2008, and to a lesser extent the change in our commerce business model to a licensing model in April 2009. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, OWN incurred operating expenses of $26 million and $6 million, respectively. 33 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2009 vs. 2008 The following table presents our consolidated results of operation for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in millions): Years Ended December 31, % ChangeFavorable/(Unfavorable) 2009 2008 Revenues: Distribution $ 1,713 $ 1,640 4 % Advertising 1,428 1,396 2 % Other 375 407 (8 )% Total revenues 3,516 3,443 2 % Costs of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization listed below 1,065 1,024 (4 )% Selling, general and administrative 1,247 1,115 (12 )% Depreciation and amortization 155 186 17 % Restructuring and impairment charges 66 61 (8 )% Gains on disposition (252 ) 2,281 2,386 4 % Operating income 1,235 1,057 17 % Interest expense, net (250 ) (256 ) 2 % Other non operating income (expense), net 46 (47 ) NM Income from continuing operations before income taxes 1,031 754 37 % Provision for income taxes (472 ) (352 ) (34 )% Income from continuing operations, net of taxes 559 402 39 % Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes 43 (100 )% Net income 559 445 26 % Less net loss (income) attributable to non controlling interests 1 (128 ) NM Net income attributable to Discovery Communications, Inc. 560 317 77 % Stock dividends to preferred interests (8 ) Net income available to Discovery Communications, Inc. stockholders $ 552 $ 317 74 % NM not meaningful. Revenues Distribution revenues increased $73 million for 2009 as compared to distribution revenues for 2008 due primarily to contractual rate increases, subscriber growth, and a reduction in amortization for launch incentives at our U.S. Networks segment and subscriber growth at our International Networks segment. These increases were partially offset by the deconsolidation of Discovery Kids in May 2009, which resulted in a decline of $20 million, and the absence of a one time revenue correction recorded in 2008 that increased revenues $8 million. Distribution revenues were also adversely affected by unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates of $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, the deconsolidation of Discovery Kids, and the one time revenue correction in 2008, distribution revenues increased 9% or $138 million. Advertising revenues for 2009 increased $32 million over advertising revenues for 2008. The increase in advertising revenues was principally due to higher ratings and overall price increases at our U.S. Networks segment and increased viewership and subscriber growth at our International Networks segment. Advertising revenues in 2009 also benefited from a $6 million settlement of a prior contract dispute at our U.K. operations. The increases were partially offset by unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates of $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates and the contract dispute settlement, advertising revenues grew 4% or $52 million. Other revenues, which primarily consist of sales of educational services and content, distribution and advertising sales services, license fees, DVDs, merchandise, and sound and music services, decreased $32 million for 2009 as compared with 2008. The decline 34 Table of Contents is attributable to decreasing merchandise sales as a result of changing our business model from direct to consumer to a licensing model where we receive royalties, lower sales of hard copy educational content as purchasers migrate to online distribution, a decline in sales of the Planet Earth DVD series, and a $6 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in online streaming distribution revenues from our education business and $6 million recorded in 2009 in connection with renegotiating our agreements to provide programming to a joint venture. We expect a reduction in our year over year commerce revenues and direct operating costs through the first fiscal quarter of 2010 due to the transition of our commerce business to a licensing model. Costs of Revenues Costs of revenues, which consist primarily of content amortization expense, production costs, distribution costs, and sales commissions, increased $41 million for 2009 when compared to costs of revenues for 2008. The increase was primarily due to higher content amortization expense and write offs primarily at our U.S. Networks and Internal Networks segments as well as higher distribution costs at our International Networks segment. Total content amortization increased $53 million, of which $17 million was attributable to a higher content asset balance while a $36 million was due to an increase in write offs was due to the decision not to proceed with certain programs or lower than expected revenues. These increases were partially offset by the effect of deconsolidating Discovery Kids, which resulted in a decline of $12 million, a $6 million reduction in our music rights accrual at the International Networks segment, the reduction in costs of goods sold as a result of transitioning our commerce business to a license model, and a $30 million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, programming write offs, the deconsolidation of Discovery Kids, and the music rights accrual reduction, costs of revenues increased 6% or $53 million. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses, which are principally comprised of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, and occupancy and back office support fees, increased $132 million for 2009 as compared to 2008 due primarily to a $294 million increase in employee costs related to share based compensation programs and the impact of consolidating OWN beginning in July 2008, which increased costs by $19 million. The increase was partially offset by lower marketing costs, consulting fees, non share based employee costs, all of which reflect targeted cost savings initiatives and improvements in operating efficiencies, and a $5 million reduction due to the deconsolidation of Discovery Kids in May 2009. Additionally, selling, general, and administrative expenses were down as a result of favorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates of $25 million. Employee costs include share based compensation expense arising from equity awards to employees under our incentive plans. Total share based compensation expense was $228 million for 2009 as compared to a net benefit of $66 million for 2008. The increase in share based compensation primarily reflects an increase in the fair value of outstanding cash settled equity awards and to a lesser extent an increase in stock options outstanding. A portion of our equity awards are cash settled and, therefore, the value of such awards outstanding must be remeasured at fair value each reporting date based on changes in the price of our Series A common stock. Compensation expense for cash settled equity awards, including changes in fair value, was $205 million for 2009 as compared to a net benefit of $69 million for 2008. Increased compensation expense for cash settled awards was due to an increase in fair value, which reflects the increase in the price of our Series A common stock of 117% during the year ended December 31, 2009. We do not intend to grant additional cash settled equity awards, except as may be required by contract or to employees in countries in which stock option awards are not permitted. We are evaluating our equity based compensation program and considering changing our current mix of awards to include performance based restricted stock unit grants. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $31 million for 2009 as compared to the depreciation and amortization expense for 2008. The decrease was due to a decline in amortization expense resulting from lower intangible asset balances in 2009 compared to 2008. Restructuring and Impairment Charges Restructuring and impairment charges increased $5 million for 2009 as compared to 2008. We recorded $32 million and $30 million of impairment charges related to intangible assets, goodwill, and capitalized software during 2009 and intangible assets in 2008, respectively, primarily for certain asset groups at our Other U.S. Networks reporting unit due to declines in expected operating performance. We also recorded exit and restructuring charges of $34 million and $31 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively, in connection with a reorganization of portions of our operations to reduce our cost structure. The charges for 2009 were primarily incurred by our U.S. Networks and International Networks segments as well as our corporate operations and include $29 million of severance costs and $5 million of contract termination costs. We expect the majority of these charges to be paid within the next year. We do not expect material future charges associated with these restructuring programs. 35 Table of Contents The charges incurred in 2008 were primarily related to TLCs repositioning strategy, the termination of a production group, and the closure of our commerce distribution center and our store headquarters offices along with the transition of the remaining commerce distribution services to third party service providers. Gain on Disposition In connection with the formation of the Hasbro Discovery joint venture, we recorded a $252 million gain during 2009, which included $127 million as a result of stepping up our basis for the 50% retained interest in Discovery Kids and $125 million for the sale of 50% of our ownership interest to Hasbro. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net decreased $6 million for 2009 when compared to 2008 primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding partially offset by an increase in the average effective interest rate on our borrowings. Other Non Operating Income (Expense), Net Other non operating income (expense), net includes our realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivative transactions that are not accounted for as hedging instruments, realized gains and losses from sale of available for sale securities, gains and losses from equity method investments, and other non operating expenses net of non operating income. Other non operating income (expense), net improved $93 million for 2009 as compared to 2008. The improvement was due to the absence of a $57 million charge recorded in 2008 for the other than temporary decline in the value of our equity method investment in HSWI, which was partially offset by the absence of a corresponding one time adjustment of $47 million recorded in 2008 to reduce the liability related to the value of shares in HSWI to be exchanged to its former shareholders. Additionally, we recognized net realized and unrealized gains on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments of $20 million during 2009 as compared to net realized and unrealized losses of $31 million during 2008 due to increased market values. The improvements were also driven by the sale of certain investments in 2009 that resulted in pre tax gains of $15 million and a net increase of $12 million in income from investments accounted for using the equity method excluding the HSWI impairment. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $472 million and $352 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The effective tax rates were 46% and 47% for 2009 and 2008. The effective tax rate for 2009 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to a permanent difference on the $252 million gain from the sale of a 50% interest in and deconsolidation of Discovery Kids in May 2009, state income taxes and to a lesser extent, deductions for domestic production activities. The effective tax rate for 2008 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% principally due to the presentation of the Newhouse Transaction as though it was consummated on January 1, 2008. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements include the gross combined financial results of both DHC and DCH since January 1, 2008. Prior to the Newhouse Transaction on September 17, 2008, DHC owned 66 2/3 % of DCH and, therefore, recognized a portion of DCHs operating results. As a result, the tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes the taxes recognized by both DCH and DHC related to the portion of DCHs operating results recognized by DHC. DHC recognized $91 million of deferred tax expense related to its investment in DCH prior to the Newhouse Transaction for 2008. The provision for income taxes for 2008 was partially offset by the release of an $18 million valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of CSS and the release of a $10 million valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry forwards for AMC. Net Loss (Income) Attributable to Non Controlling Interests Net loss (income) attributable to non controlling interests represents the portion of net operating results allocable to the non controlling partners, which was $1 million for 2009 and $(128) million for 2008. The change in net loss (income) attributable to non controlling interests is primarily a result of allocating a portion of DCHs 2008 profits to Advance/Newhouse for its ownership interest in DCH prior to the Newhouse Transaction. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes In September 2008, as part of the Newhouse Transaction, DHC completed the spin off to its shareholders of AMC, which did not result in a gain or loss. 36 Table of Contents In September 2008, prior to the Newhouse Transaction, DHC sold its ownership interests in Ascent Media Systems & Technology Services, LLC (AMSTS) and Ascent Media CANS, LLC (DBA AccentHealth) for approximately $7 million and $119 million, respectively, in cash. The sale of these companies resulted in pre tax gains of $3 million for AMSTS and $64 million for AccentHealth. Also in September 2008, prior to the Newhouse Transaction, DHC disposed of certain buildings and equipment for approximately $13 million in cash. DHC recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $9 million in connection with the asset disposals. The disposed assets were part of the AMC business. The following table presents summary financial information for discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 (in millions) Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 Revenues $ 484 Loss from the operations of discontinued operations before income taxes $ (6 ) Loss from the operations of discontinued operations, net of taxes $ (4 ) Gains on dispositions, net of taxes $ 47 Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes $ 43 Income per share from discontinued operations available to Discovery Communications, Inc. stockholders, basic and diluted $ 0.13 Weighted average number of shares outstanding: Basic 321 Diluted 322 Stock Dividends to Preferred Interests During 2009, the Company recognized $8 million for non cash stock dividends for the release of approximately 500,000 shares of preferred stock from escrow. Additional information regarding the stock dividend is set forth in Note 13 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Segment Results of Operations As noted above, we manage and report our operations in three segments: U.S. Networks; International Networks; and Commerce, Education, and Other. Corporate primarily consists of corporate functions, executive management, administrative support services, and ancillary revenues and expenses from a consolidated joint venture. Corporate expenses are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon decisions made directly by segment executives. Operating results exclude mark to market share based compensation, restructuring and impairment charges, and gains (losses) on business and asset dispositions, consistent with our segment reporting. Additional financial information related to our segments is set forth in Note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We evaluate the operating performance of our segments based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (Adjusted OIBDA). Adjusted OIBDA is defined as revenues less costs of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses excluding: (i) mark to market share based compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) amortization of deferred launch incentives, (iv) exit and restructuring charges, (v) impairment charges, and (vi) gains (losses) on business and asset dispositions. We use this measure to assess operating results and performance of our segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance and allocate resources to each segment. We believe Adjusted OIBDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses and also provides investors a measure to analyze the operating performance of each segment against historical data. We exclude mark to market share based compensation, exit and restructuring charges, impairment charges, and gains (losses) on business and asset dispositions from the calculation of Adjusted OIBDA due to their volatility or non recurring nature. We also exclude the amortization of deferred launch incentive payments because these payments are infrequent and the amortization does not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Because Adjusted OIBDA is a non GAAP measure, it should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flows provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 37 Table of Contents The following table presents our revenues by segment and certain consolidated operating expenses, contra revenue amounts, and Adjusted OIBDA (in millions): % Change Years Ended December 31, Favorable/ 2009 2008 (Unfavorable) Revenues: U.S. Networks $ 2,142 $ 2,062 4 % International Networks 1,189 1,158 3 % Commerce, Education, and Other 176 196 (10 )% Corporate and intersegment eliminations 9 27 (67 )% Total revenues 3,516 3,443 2 % Costs of revenues (1) (1,065 ) (1,024 ) (4 )% Selling, general and administrative (1) (1,042 ) (1,184 ) 12 % Add: Amortization of deferred launch incentives (2) 55 75 (27 )% Adjusted OIBDA $ 1,464 $ 1,310 12 % (1) Costs of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses exclude mark to market share based compensation, depreciation and amortization, exit and restructuring charges, impairments of intangible assets, goodwill, capitalized software costs, and a gain on a business disposition.

The increase in total revenues was due primarily to increases in distribution revenues of $55 million and advertising revenues of $24 million. Increased distribution revenues for 2009 were due to annual contractual rate increases, an increase in paying subscribers, principally for networks carried on the digital tier, and a decline of $13 million for the amortization of launch incentives. These increases were partially offset by the effect of deconsolidating Discovery Kids in May 2009, which resulted in a decline of $20 million, and the absence of a one time revenue correction recorded during the second quarter of 2008 that increased revenues $8 million. Advertising revenues for 2009 increased as a result of higher ratings and overall increased pricing, which were partially offset by lower cash sellouts due to softness in the economy. Costs of Revenues Costs of revenues, which consist primarily of content amortization expense, sales commissions, production costs, and distribution costs, increased $24 million for 2009 as compared to costs of revenues for 2008. The increase in costs of revenues was driven by an increase of $30 million in content amortization expense, of which $18 million was due to a higher content asset balance, reflecting our continued investment in content, and $12 million was attributable to higher write offs of certain programming costs that are included as content amortization, partially offset by decreases in production and distribution costs. The increase in costs of revenues is net of a $12 million decline due to the effect of deconsolidating Discovery Kids. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses, which are principally comprised of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, and occupancy and back office support fees, decreased $42 million for 2009 when compared to selling, general and administrative expenses for 2008. The decrease was attributable primarily to lower marketing and overhead costs, which reflects our cost reduction efforts. Also contributing to the decline was the effect of deconsolidating Discovery Kids in May 2009, which resulted in a decline of $5 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher employee costs and an additional $19 million of costs related to OWN, which we began consolidating in July 2008. 39 Table of Contents Adjusted OIBDA Adjusted OIBDA increased $85 million for 2009 in comparison to Adjusted OIBDA for 2008. The improved performance is primarily due to higher distribution revenues driven by annual contractual rate increases and subscriber growth, an increase in advertising revenues due to increased ratings and overall pricing, and lower marketing and overhead costs. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in content amortization and write offs and costs associated with OWN. International Networks The following table presents, for our International Networks segment, revenues by type, certain operating expenses, contra revenue amounts, Adjusted OIBDA, and a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to operating income (in millions). % Change Years Ended December 31, Favorable/ 2009 2008 (Unfavorable) Revenues: Distribution $ 731 $ 713 3 % Advertising 345 336 3 % Other 113 109 4 % Total revenues 1,189 1,158 3 % Costs of revenues (422 ) (394 ) (7 )% Selling, general and administrative (351 ) (418 ) 16 % Add: Amortization of deferred launch incentives 34 41 (17 )% Adjusted OIBDA 450 387 16 % Amortization of deferred launch incentives (34 ) (41 ) 17 % Depreciation and amortization (41 ) (43 ) 5 % Restructuring and impairment charges (22 ) (2 ) NM Operating income $ 353 $ 301 17 % NM not meaningful. Revenues Total revenues for 2009 increased $31 million as compared to total revenues for 2008. The increase in total revenues was due primarily to operational increases in distribution revenues and advertising revenues, which were partially offset by unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates of $69 million. Excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, total revenues increased 10% or $100 million. Distribution revenues increased $18 million for 2009 when compared to distribution revenues for 2008, net of unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates of $37 million. Excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, distribution revenues increased 9% or $55 million. The increase in distribution revenues was attributable to growth in the number of paying subscribers in Latin America, EMEA and Asia Pacific, which reflect the growth in pay television services in these regions. Advertising revenues increased $9 million for 2009 in comparison to advertising revenues for 2008, including the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates of $26 million. Excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, advertising revenues increased 12% or $35 million. Increased advertising revenues was primarily due to growth in the U.K., EMEA, and Latin America, which reflects higher viewership combined with an increased subscriber base. Increased viewership was attributable to growth in pay television in certain markets and expanded distribution of our networks. Advertising revenues in 2009 also benefited from a $6 million settlement of a prior contract dispute at our U.K. operations. In October 2009, we renewed an agreement with our advertising sales representative in the U.K. resulting in our ability to increase the monetization of our audience, primarily on a go forward basis. Other revenues for 2009 include $6 million recorded in connection with renegotiating our agreements to provide content to a joint venture. 40 Table of Contents Costs of Revenues Costs of revenues, which consist primarily of content amortization expense, distribution costs, sales commissions, and production costs, increased $28 million for 2009 as compared to costs of revenues for 2008. The increase was driven by higher content amortization expense and distribution costs, partially offset by a $6 million reduction in our music rights accrual related to a change in estimate in the third quarter of 2009. Content amortization expense increased 8% or $20 million, driven by an increase of $13 million due to a higher content asset balance, reflecting our continued investment in original content production and language customization to support additional local feeds for growth in local advertising sales, $24 million more in write offs of programming costs, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $17 million. Distribution costs increased $10 million as a result of expanding the distribution of our networks in certain markets. The increases in costs of revenues were net of favorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates of $30 million. Excluding the favorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, costs of revenues increased 17% or $58 million. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses, which are principally comprised of employee costs, marketing costs, occupancy and back office support fees, decreased $67 million for 2009 when compared to selling, general, and administrative expenses for 2008. The decrease is attributable to lower marketing and employee costs as a result of cost saving initiatives and improvements in operating efficiencies and a $25 million benefit due to favorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the favorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, selling, general and administrative expenses declined 11% or $42 million. Adjusted OIBDA Adjusted OIBDA increased $63 million for 2009 as compared to Adjusted OIBDA for 2008. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, Adjusted OIBDA increased 24% or $83 million. The improvement in performance reflects growth in distribution revenues resulting from subscriber growth, an increase in advertising due to higher viewership and subscribers, and a decline in marketing and personnel costs. These increases were partially offset by increases in content amortization and write offs and distribution costs. Commerce, Education, and Other The following table presents, for our Commerce, Education, and Other segment, revenues, certain operating expenses, Adjusted OIBDA, and a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to operating income (loss) (in millions). % Change Years Ended December 31, Favorable/ 2009 2008 (Unfavorable) Revenues: Advertising $ 1 $ Other 175 196 (11 )% Total revenues 176 196 (10 )% Costs of revenues (103 ) (116 ) 11 % Selling, general and administrative (51 ) (67 ) 24 % Adjusted OIBDA 22 13 69 % Depreciation and amortization (6 ) (9 ) 33 % Restructuring and impairment charges (2 ) (6 ) 67 % Operating income (loss) $ 14 $ (2 ) NM NM not meaningful. Revenues Total revenues for 2009 decreased $20 million as compared to total revenues for 2008 principally driven by a decrease of $25 million in commerce sales reflecting the transition of our commerce business to a licensing model in early 2009, a decrease in sound services, and a decline in sales of hardcopy education content. These decreases were partially offset by growth in our education online streaming distribution revenues as a result of the continued migration from hardcopy to online distribution of our education content. We expect the transition of our commerce business to a licensing model will result in a reduction in our year over year commerce revenues and direct operating costs through the first fiscal quarter of 2010. 41 Table of Contents Costs of Revenues Costs of revenues, which consist principally of production costs, royalty payments, and content amortization expense, decreased $13 million for 2009 as compared to costs of revenues for 2008 primarily due to a reduction in direct operating costs as a result of the transition of our commerce business to a licensing model in early 2009 and to a lesser extent reductions in production costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses, which are principally comprised of employee costs, occupancy expenses, and marketing costs, decreased $16 million for 2009 when compared to selling, general and administrative expenses for 2008 primarily due to cost reductions in the commerce business. The decline in expenses in the commerce business was attributable to lower employee costs as a result of the transition of our commerce business to a licensing model in early 2009. Adjusted OIBDA Adjusted OIBDA for 2009 increased $9 million as compared to Adjusted OIBDA for 2008. The increase principally reflects growth in education online streaming distribution revenues as users migrate from hard copy education content and cost reductions from the transition of our commerce business to a licensing model, partially offset by a decrease from the sound services business. Corporate and Intersegment Eliminations The following table presents, for our unallocated corporate amounts, revenues, certain operating expenses, Adjusted OIBDA, and a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to operating loss (in millions).

Corporate primarily consists of corporate functions, executive management, administrative support services, and ancillary revenues and expenses from a consolidated joint venture. Consistent with our segment reporting, corporate expenses are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate business segment performance based upon decisions made directly by business segment executives. Corporate revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $18 million, when compared with the corresponding period in 2008, primarily due to decreased ancillary revenues from a consolidated joint venture, whose primary sales were of the Planet Earth DVD. Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $17 million for 2009 driven by lower personnel and consulting costs as a result of cost savings initiatives. 42 Table of Contents 2008 vs. 2007 Consolidated Results of Operations The following discussion of our results of operations is presented in three parts to assist the reader in better understanding our operations. The table below reconciles our and DHCs prior year income statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP to the financial information discussed in our adjusted results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. The second section is an overall discussion of our consolidated operating results. The third section includes a more detailed discussion of revenue and expense activity of our three operating divisions: U.S. Networks, International Networks, and Commerce, Education, and Other. The following table represents the year ended December 31, 2007 on an as adjusted basis (in millions). The information in the DHC Historical and DCH Historical columns is derived from the historical statement of operations of DHC included elsewhere herein (and has been adjusted to conform to Discoverys presentation) and the historical statement of operations for DHC included in Part IV of the 2008 Form 10 K. The adjustments column reflects specific adjustments required to present the Discovery As Adjusted column as if the Newhouse Transaction occurred on January 1, 2007. We believe that the 2007 as adjusted presentation will assist the reader in better understanding our operations as this presentation is on a comparable basis with the 2008 Statement of Operations, therefore operating trends are more clearly presented. However, the actual results of operations for 2007 could have been significantly different than the 2007 as adjusted results had the Newhouse Transaction actually closed on January 1, 2007.

Distribution revenues increased $163 million during the year primarily due to International Networks subscriber growth combined with annual contract increases for the fully distributed U.S. Networks, offset by the disposition of Travel Channel. Advertising revenues increased $51 million for the period, and is primarily attributed to higher pricing and cash sellout rates in U.S. Networks. Other revenues increased $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007, as adjusted, primarily due to an increase in licensing revenues in the International Networks, increase in sales of the Planet Earth DVD through a joint venture, and increases in revenues from our representation of the Travel Channel through our U.S. Networks segment, offset by a decline in revenues from the direct to consumer business in our Commerce, Education, and Other business segment. Costs of Revenues Costs of revenues, which includes content amortization and other production related expenses in addition to distribution and merchandising costs, decreased $203 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared to 2007, as adjusted. The decrease in costs of revenues was primarily due to the effect of content impairment charges in the fourth quarter 2007 of $139 million primarily in U.S. Networks coupled with a $76 million decrease in related amortization expense. These decreases were partially offset by increases in costs of revenue in the International Networks and content impairment related to TLC. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses, which include certain personnel, marketing and other general and administrative expenses, decreased $203 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 2007, as adjusted, primarily attributable to a $210 million decrease in expenses arising from long term incentive plans, which were partially offset by slight increases in costs incurred in conjunction with DCH preparing to become a consolidated subsidiary of ours as a result of the Newhouse Transaction and an increase in personnel costs in International Networks. Expenses arising from long term incentive plans are largely related to DCHs unit based, long term incentive plan, the Discovery Appreciation Plan or the DAP, or LTIP, which was modified to reflect our capital structure following the Newhouse Transaction. Prior to the Newhouse Transaction, the value of units in the LTIP was indexed to the value of DHC Series A common stock. After the Newhouse Transaction, the units remained outstanding and were converted at the effective time of the Newhouse Transaction to track changes in the value of our Series A common stock. The change in unit value of LTIP awards outstanding is recorded as expenses arising from long term incentive plans over the period outstanding. Primarily due to the decrease in both the DHC Series A common stock and our Series A common stock price during the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a benefit of $69 million to expenses arising from long term incentive plans in 2008 compared to expenses arising from long term incentive plans of $141 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as adjusted. In the fourth quarter 2008, eligible new hires and promoted employees received stock options that vest in four equal installments, and those employees with LTIP units that vest between September 18, 2008 and March 14, 2009 will receive cash settled stock appreciation awards that expire in March 2010. We do not intend to make additional cash settled stock appreciation awards, except as may be required by contract or to employees in countries where stock option awards are not permitted. Depreciation and Amortization The increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2008 is due to an increase in intangible assets resulting from the reclassification of DHC intangibles following the Newhouse Transaction and the HowStuffWorks.com acquisition. Restructuring and Impairment Charges During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $31 million in restructuring charges, of which $11 million relates to the relocation and severance costs related to TLCs repositioning strategy, $6 million for the termination of a production group, and $6 million due to the closure of our commerce distribution center and our store headquarters offices along with the transition of the remaining commerce distribution services to third party service providers. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded restructuring charges of $20 million related to a number of organizational and strategic adjustments. The purpose of these adjustments was to better align our organizational structure with our new strategic priorities and to respond to continuing changes within the media industry. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a write off of intangible assets of $30 million related to our HowStuffWorks.com business. This write off of intangible assets was due to the decline in the cash flows projected to be generated by the HowStuffWorks.com business. During the second quarter of 2007, DCH recorded an asset impairment of $26 million which represents write offs of intangible assets related to the education business. 45 Table of Contents Gains on Dispositions In 2007, we exchanged the capital stock of a subsidiary that held the Travel Channel and travelchannel.com (collectively, the Travel Business) for Cox Communications Holdings, Inc.s 25% ownership interest in us and $1.3 billion in cash. The distribution of the Travel Business, which was valued at $575 million, resulted in a $135 million tax free gain. Interest Expense, Net On May 14, 2007, we entered into a $1.5 billion term loan in conjunction with the transaction with Cox Communications Holdings, Inc., offset by a $180 million payment for a senior note that matured. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007, as adjusted, is primarily a result of the term loan. Other Non Operating (Expense) Income, Net Other non operating (expense) income, net includes our equity in the operating results of unconsolidated affiliates, other non operating income net of non operating expenses, as well as unrealized losses from derivative instruments. Equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates in 2008 consisted primarily of a $57 million other than temporary decline in the value of our equity method investment in HSWi, coupled with $13 million in equity losses recorded during 2008, which is offset by equity in income from our joint ventures in Canada and Japan. In 2007, we recognized $9 million of equity in income primarily from our joint ventures in Canada and Japan. Other non operating income consisted of a $47 million reduction of a liability related to the value of shares in HSWi to be exchanged to its former shareholders, which was recorded in December 2008. Offsetting this non operating income is unrealized losses from derivative transactions. Unrealized losses from derivative transactions relate primarily to our use of derivative instruments to modify our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our debt. These instruments include a combination of swaps, caps, collars and other structured instruments. As a result of unrealized mark to market adjustments, we recognized unrealized losses of $31 million and $9 million during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The foreign exchange hedging instruments used by us are spot, forward and option contracts. Additionally, we enter into non designated forward contracts to hedge non dollar denominated cash flows and foreign currency balances. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was 47% and 36% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, as adjusted, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 differed from the federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to DHCs recognition of deferred tax expense related to its investment in DCH (net of tax benefit from intangible amortization related to the spin off of the Travel Channel in 2007), which is partially offset by the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of Ascent Media Sound, Inc. Other items impacting the effective tax rate include the following: our conversion from deducting foreign taxes to claiming foreign tax credits, foreign unrecognized tax positions, and other miscellaneous items. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007, as adjusted, was not materially different than the federal income tax rate of 35%. However, during this period we benefited from the tax free treatment of the gain recognized on the disposition of the Travel Channel and the release of Travel Channel deferred tax liabilities, offset by the tax impact of discontinued operations. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes Summarized financial information included in discontinued operations is set forth in the following table (in millions). Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 As Adjusted Revenues $ 484 $ 689 Loss from the operations of discontinued operations before income taxes $ (6 ) $ (250 ) Loss from the operations of discontinued operations, net of taxes $ (4 ) $ (219 ) Gains on dispositions, net of taxes $ 47 $ Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes $ 43 $ (219 ) Income (loss) per share from discontinued operations available to Discovery Communications, Inc. stockholders, basic and diluted $ 0.13 $ (0.78 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding: Basic 321 281 Diluted 322 281 46 Table of Contents On September 17, 2008, as part of the Newhouse Transaction, DHC completed the spin off to its shareholders of AMC, a subsidiary holding the cash and businesses of DHC, except for CSS, which provides sound, music, mixing, sound effects and other related services under brand names such as Sound One, POP Sound, Soundelux and Todd A O (which businesses remained with us following the completion of the Newhouse Transaction). The AMC spin off was structured such that there was no gain or loss related to the transaction. Just prior to the Newhouse Transaction, DHC sold its ownership interests in Ascent Media CANS, LLC (D/B/A AccentHealth) to AccentHealth Holdings LLC, an unaffiliated third party, for approximately $119 million in cash. It was determined that AccentHealth was a non core asset, and the sale of AccentHealth was consistent with DHCs strategy to divest non core assets. DHC recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $64 million in connection with the sale of AccentHealth, which is recorded as a component of discontinued operations. As there is no continuing involvement in the operations of AMC or AccentHealth, the financial results of their operations have been presented as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Following a comprehensive strategic review of our businesses, we closed 103 mall based and stand alone Discovery Stores in the third quarter of 2007. As there is no continuing involvement in the retail stores or significant migration of retail customers to e commerce, the results of the Retail business are accounted for as discontinued operations in the as adjusted results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. Net Loss (Income) Attributable to Non Controlling Interests Non controlling interests primarily represent our and consolidated entities portion of earnings which are allocable to the non controlling partners. The increase in net income attributable to non controlling interests during the year ended December 31, 2008 is primarily a result of our increased profits allocated to non controlling partners prior to the Newhouse Transaction and reporting of our financial results in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, Consolidations (ASC 810).

Accordingly, DCHs 2007 results of operations do not include Travel Channel after May 14, 2007. The disposal of Travel Channel does not meet the requirements for discontinued operations presentation. The following table represents U.S. Networks results of operations excluding Travel Channel for all periods. Although this presentation is not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe this presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the U.S. Networks results of operations and allows the reader to better understand the U.S. Networks ongoing operations. 48 Table of Contents U.S. Networks without Travel Channel Years Ended December 31, % ChangeFavorable/ (Unfavorable) 2008 2007 As Adjusted Revenues: Distribution $ 927 $ 840 10 % Advertising 1,058 975 9 % Other 77 64 20 % Total revenues 2,062 1,879 10 % Costs of revenues (509 ) (673 ) 24 % Selling, general and administrative (476 ) (447 ) (6 )% Add: Amortization of deferred launch incentives 34 51 (33 )% Adjusted OIBDA 1,111 810 37 % Amortization of deferred launch incentives (34 ) (51 ) 33 % Mark to market share based compensation (4 ) Depreciation and amortization (56 ) (28 ) (100 )% Restructuring and impairment charges (51 ) Operating income $ 966 $ 731 32 % Since the disposal of Travel Channel in 2007 did not meet the requirements of discontinued operations presentation, and the results of Travel Channel are not consolidated with DCH post transaction, the following discussion excludes the results of Travel Channel for all periods so as to facilitate comparability of the U.S. Networks segment data. Revenues Total revenues increased $183 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007. Distribution revenue increased $87 million over the period, driven by annual contractual rate increases for fully distributed networks combined with subscription units, principally from networks carried on the digital tier. Distribution revenue includes a one time $8 million adjustment resulting from improvements in our methodology of estimating accrued revenue for certain distribution operators. The adjustment was recorded in its entirety in the second quarter of 2008 and is not material to the current or prior periods. Contra revenue items included in distribution revenue, such as launch amortization and marketing consideration, decreased $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007. This decrease includes $3 million for replacement decoder boxes to support the digitization of an analog transponder recorded as contra revenue in the second quarter of 2007. Advertising revenue increased $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher pricing in the up front and scatter markets, as well as higher cash sellouts, which were partially offset by under delivery of committed audience levels, when compared with the corresponding prior year periods. Other revenue increased $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily from our representation of the Travel Channel, which increased $11 million during the period, coupled with an increase of $5 million in revenue from How Stuff Works, which was acquired in December 2007. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $6 million of international program sales revenue, which is now reported in the International Networks segment. Costs of Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2008, costs of revenues decreased $164 million when compared with 2007, primarily due to a decrease in content amortization expense of $156 million. The decrease in content amortization expense was primarily a result of the effect of the $129 million content impairment charge recorded in 2007 following a change in management and related changes in strategy. This charge coupled with the related $76 million decrease in content amortization expense was offset by $17 million of content impairment charges for TLC programs following a change in management and related changes in strategy in the second half of 2008, and content amortization expense for new programming on Discovery Channel, TLC, Planet Green and Science Channel. Selling, General and Administrative Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007, which was primarily a result of a $34 million increase in personnel costs, primarily driven by continued investment in digital media, including acquisitions made during the third and fourth quarters of 2007. This increase was partially offset by decreased marketing expense of $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with the corresponding prior year period. 49 Table of Contents Adjusted OIBDA The U.S. Networks segments operating performance improved as reflected by an increase in adjusted OIBDA of $301 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007. The improved performance is primarily due to revenue growth driven by subscriber growth coupled with higher pricing and lower costs of revenue due to declines in content amortization expense.

Distribution revenue increased $76 million in EMEA, Latin America, and Asia Pacific primarily as a result of a 16% increase in average paying subscription units. In addition, foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $13 million on distribution revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007. Advertising revenue increased $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007. Advertising revenue increased $42 million in EMEA and Latin America primarily due to higher viewership combined with an increased subscriber base in most markets worldwide. These increases were offset by a $35 million decrease in the U.K. due to an interpretation of a contract provision resulting in a limitation in our ability to monetize our audience in the U.K., as well as a deterioration in market conditions. Advertising revenue decreased $4 million due to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Other revenue increased $24 million mainly due to improvement in licensing and sales of programs primarily in the U.K. offset by a $2 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Costs of Revenues Costs of revenues increased $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007, driven by a $40 million increase in content amortization expense due to continued investment in original productions and language customization to support additional local feeds for growth in local ad sales partially offset by favorable foreign exchange of $10 million and a reduction in sales commissions of $5 million. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007. This decrease was driven by a $26 million reduction in marketing expenditures coupled with the favorable impact of $3 million from foreign exchange. 50 Table of Contents Adjusted OIBDA The International Networks segments operating performance improved as reflected in an increase in adjusted OIBDA of $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007. The improved performance reflects revenue growth driven by subscription growth in EMEA, Latin America and Asia Pacific and a reduction in marketing expenditures, partially offset by increased content amortization expense due to continued investment in original productions and language customization.

Revenues Commerce, Education, and Other total revenues decreased $29 million for the year ended 2008 when compared with the prior year. A challenging retail environment in 2008 coupled with the success of the Planet Earth DVD in 2007 contributed to a year over year decline of 48% in revenue from the direct to consumer business, which was partially offset by higher licensing revenue. Education revenue increased by $6 million as the core streaming business continued to grow. New revenue streams in licensing and sponsorships were slightly offset by the decline in the hardcopy business as customers shifted to our digital services. Revenues generated by the CSS business were relatively flat compared with 2007. Costs of Revenues Costs of revenues decreased $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, commensurate with the decrease in Commerces product revenue coupled with a decrease in Educations content amortization, which resulted from the fourth quarter 2007 write off of capitalized content costs that were not aligned with Educations product offerings. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower personnel and marketing costs incurred in Commerce and Education coupled with a $2 million legal expense in 2007 for a legal settlement. These decreases were partially offset by a slight increase in selling, general and administrative expense from the CSS business. Adjusted OIBDA Adjusted OIBDA increased $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared to 2007, which reflects our efforts to reduce costs in response to the challenging retail environment during the year, reflected by a decline in revenue. 51 Table of Contents Corporate and Intersegment Eliminations Years Ended December 31, % ChangeFavorable/(Unfavorable) 2008 2007 As Adjusted Revenues: Other $ 27 $ 7 NM Total revenues 27 7 NM Costs of revenues (5 ) (4 ) (25 )% Selling, general and administrative (223 ) (192 ) (16 )% Adjusted OIBDA (201 ) (189 ) (6 )% Market to market share based compensation 73 (141 ) NM Depreciation and amortization (78 ) (53 ) (47 )% Restructuring and impairment charges (2 ) (17 ) 88 % Gains on dispositions 136 (100 )% Operating loss $ (208 ) $ (264 ) 21 % NM not meaningful. Corporate is mainly comprised of ancillary revenue and expenses from a joint venture, corporate functions, executive management and administrative support services. Consistent with our segment reporting, corporate expenses are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate business segment performance based upon decisions made directly by business segment executives. Corporate revenues increased $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007, primarily due to increased ancillary revenue from a joint venture, whose primary sales were of the Planet Earth DVD; current sales volume is not expected to continue. Corporate costs increased $32 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008, driven by increased costs incurred in conjunction with our preparing to become a public entity as a result of the Newhouse Transaction and costs related to the start up of OWN. Liquidity and Capital Resources This section provides a description of our primary sources and uses of cash, as well as significant transactions affecting liquidity, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. The following table represents a comparison of the components of the statement of cash flows, as reported for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 with a reconciliation of historical DCH statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2007 (in millions). Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 (2) 2007 (1)(2) Cash provided by operating activities $ 608 $ 569 $ 300 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 266 $ 98 $ (446 ) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (356 ) $ (774 ) $ 187 (1) The 2007 amounts reflect the gross combined cash flow activities of both DHC and DCH as though the Newhouse Transaction was completed January 1, 2007. The 2007 amounts include net operating cash inflows of $58 million and $242 million from DHC and DCH, respectively, investing cash outflows of ($15) million and ($431) million from DHC and DCH, respectively, and financing cash inflows of $12 million for DHC and $175 million for DCH. (2) The cash flow activity also includes cash flows for AMC for both the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, including cash provided by operating activities of $28 million, cash provided by investing activities of $128 million, and cash used in financing 52 Table of Contents activities of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. AMC cash provided by operating activities was $61 million, cash used in investing activities was $15 million, and cash provided by financing activities was $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Sources of Cash Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations, proceeds from business dispositions, available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, and access to capital markets. We anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated by or available to the Company should be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $2.2 billion of total liquidity, comprised of $623 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and the ability to borrow approximately $1.6 billion under our revolving credit facility. Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2009, our cash provided by operating activities was $608 million, as compared to $569 million and $300 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, driven by a decrease in cash provided by working capital primarily due to cash paid for income taxes of $444 million, $194 million, and $75 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily due to higher operating income and $108 million in taxes paid related to the sale of our 50% interest in Discovery Kids. The amount for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes $17 million for taxes paid by discontinued operations. Investing Activities Cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $266 million compared to $98 million and $(446) million during the corresponding periods in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase primarily reflects $300 million we received from Hasbro in exchange for a 50% ownership interest in a new joint venture that operates the Discovery Kids business and a decrease in capital expenditures of $45 million and $71 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 2008 and 2007, respectively. Financing Activities At December 31, 2009, our committed debt facilities included two term loans, a revolving credit facility, and various senior notes. Total commitments under these facilities were $5.0 billion at December 31, 2009, of which $3.4 billion of indebtedness was outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2009, providing additional borrowing capacity of $1.6 billion. On August 19, 2009, DCL issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes maturing on August 15, 2019 (the August 2019 Notes). DCL received net proceeds of $492 million from the offering after deducting the issuance costs. DCL used the net proceeds of the offering to repay $428 million of indebtedness outstanding under its Term Loan A, prior to final maturity on October 31, 2010. The remaining proceeds are for general corporate purposes. The August 2019 Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with all of DCLs other unsecured senior indebtedness. The August 2019 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by Discovery. On May 14, 2009, DCH entered into Credit Agreement Supplement No. 1 (Term Loan C) to its Term Loan B. Pursuant to Term Loan C, DCH incurred $500 million of indebtedness, which matures on May 14, 2014. DCH received net proceeds of $478 million from the borrowing after deducting issuance costs. DCH used the net proceeds of the borrowing to repay $163 million and $315 million of indebtedness outstanding under DCLs Term Loan A and the revolving credit facility, respectively. The Term Loan C indebtedness is repayable in equal quarterly installments of $1.25 million beginning June 30, 2009 through March 31, 2014, with the balance due on the maturity date. Term Loan C bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 3.25%, with a LIBOR floor of 2.00%, which was 5.25% at December 31, 2009. From May 14, 2009 through December 31, 2009, the weighted average effective interest rate for Term Loan C was 6.03%. We currently hold fixed rate swaps that economically hedge the interest rate risk on all of our outstanding variable rate debt. The anticipated interest payments, together with the scheduled principal payments, due over the next year are within the available capacity on our committed facilities. Although we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations and to meet our debt service obligations over the next twelve months, we may seek to arrange new financing. 53 Table of Contents Term Loan B and Term Loan C are secured by DCHs assets, excluding assets held by its subsidiaries. The revolving credit facility and senior notes are unsecured. The debt facilities contain covenants that require the respective borrowers to meet certain financial ratios and place restrictions on the payment of dividends, sale of assets, additional borrowings, mergers, and purchases of capital stock, assets and investments. We were compliant with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2009 and have sufficient excess capacity to draw on existing debt commitments or incur additional debt. Uses of Cash Our primary uses of cash include the creation and acquisition of new content, commitments to equity affiliates, and debt and related interest payments. We expect our cash used to acquire content to continue to increase as we continue to invest in high quality programming. Investing Activities We and the BBC have formed several cable and satellite television network joint ventures to develop and distribute programming content. Under the terms of our agreements with the BBC, it has the right, every three years starting December 31, 2002, to require us to purchase its ownership interests in those joint ventures. Due to the complexities of the redemption formula, we have accrued the value of the redemption, or put right, at approximately $49 million as of December 31, 2009. We are currently discussing with the BBC potential revisions to all of our contractual relationships, including the ownership of the joint ventures. While there can be no assurance that these or other negotiations would result in a definitive agreement, we expect that the cost of a negotiated acquisition of the BBCs interests in the joint ventures could substantially exceed the value of the put right. On July 23, 2008, we formed a 50 50 joint venture with Oprah Winfrey and Harpo, Inc. Pursuant to the venture agreement, Discovery is committed to loan up to $100 million to the venture through September 30, 2011 to fund operations, of which $35 million has been funded as of December 31, 2009. We anticipate that sufficient funds will be available to meet funding needs under our obligation in 2010. To the extent that funding the joint venture in excess of $100 million is necessary, we may provide additional funds through a member loan or require the joint venture to seek third party financing. We expect to recoup the entire amount contributed in future periods provided that the joint venture is profitable and has sufficient funds to repay us. We are currently discussing with Harpo a number of matters regarding the OWN Network, including digital strategy, the programming and development pipeline, and increases in our funding commitment, which is currently $100 million. Financing Activities During the year ended December 31, 2009, $356 million of cash was used in financing activities as compared to $774 million used for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $187 million provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2007. Our primary use of cash for financing activities during 2009 was principal payments under our debt facilities totaling $1.3 billion. This outflow was partially offset by $970 million in net cash proceeds from Term Loan C and the August 2019 Notes discussed previously. During the year ended December 31, 2008, our primary uses of cash for financing activities were $356 million in cash disbursed in connection with the spinoff of Ascent Media Corporation and principal repayments of $382 million under our debt facilities. In 2010, we expect our uses of cash to include a minimum of $20 million for debt repayments, between $210 million and $240 million for interest expense, and approximately $50 million for capital expenditures. Additionally, we expect to make payments to settle vested employee cash settled equity awards. Actual amounts expensed and payable for cash settled equity awards are dependent on future calculations of fair value which are primarily affected by changes in our stock price, changes in the number of awards outstanding, and changes to the plan. The current portion accrued for these cash settled awards was $117 million as of December 31, 2009. Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources If we were to experience a significant decline in operating performance, or have to meet an unanticipated need for additional liquidity beyond our available commitments, there is no certainty that we would be able to access the needed liquidity. While we have established relationships with U.S. and international banks and investors which continue to participate in our various credit agreements, the current state of the credit markets may cause some lenders to have to reduce or withdraw their commitments if we were to seek to negotiate a refinancing or an increase in our total commitments. Covenants in existing debt agreements may constrain our capacity for additional debt or there may be significant increases in costs to refinance existing debt to access additional liquidity. As a public company, we may have access to other sources of capital such as the public bond and equity markets. However, access to sufficient liquidity in these markets is not assured given our substantial debt outstanding and the continued volatility in the equity and credit markets. On June 17, 2009, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S 3 (shelf registration) with the SEC in which we registered securities, including debt securities, common stock, and preferred stock. The August 2019 Notes were issued under this shelf registration. While we are not required to issue additional securities under this shelf registration, we may issue additional securities at a future date. Our access to capital markets can be affected by factors outside of our control. In addition, our cost to borrow is impacted by market conditions and our financial performance as measured by certain credit metrics defined in our credit agreements, including interest coverage and leverage ratios. 54 Table of Contents We expect to have sufficient cash flow from operations in 2010, combined with $623 million of cash on hand at December 31, 2009, to meet future needs including mandatory principal repayments of debt, interest payments, expected capital expenditures, and payments to settle vested employee cash settled equity awards. In addition, we have $1.6 billion of available capacity on our existing revolving credit facility if our cash flow from operations is less than anticipated. Our revolving credit facility expires in October 2010. We are currently assessing our options to extend or enter into a new facility. We were compliant with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2009 and have sufficient excess capacity to draw on existing debt commitments or incur additional debt. We have no indication that any of our lenders would be unable to perform under the requirements of our credit agreements should we seek additional funding. Although our leverage and interest coverage covenants limit the total amount of debt we might incur relative to our operating cash flow, we expect we would continue to maintain compliance with our debt covenants with a 50% reduction in our current operating performance. Contractual Obligations We have agreements for leases of satellite transponders, facilities and equipment. These agreements expire at various dates through 2028. We are obligated to license programming under agreements with content suppliers that expire over various dates. We also have other contractual commitments arising in the ordinary course of business. A summary of all of the expected payments for these commitments as well as future principal payments under the current debt arrangements and minimum payments under capital leases at December 31, 2009 is as follows (in millions). Payments Due by Period(1) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term debt $ 3,394 $ 20 $ 585 $ 1,899 $ 890 Interest payments(2) 976 205 358 257 156 Capital leases 153 27 49 27 50 Operating leases 337 70 105 70 92 Content 440 287 111 42 Other(3) 445 128 121 57 139 Total $ 5,745 $ 737 $ 1,329 $ 2,352 $ 1,327 (1) Table does not include certain long term obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as the timing of the payments cannot be predicted or the amounts will not be settled in cash. The most significant of these obligations include $148 million accrued under our cash settled equity awards and $71 million related to unrecognized tax benefits. (2) Amounts (i) are based on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2009, (ii) assume the interest rates on our floating rate debt and associated interest rate swaps remain constant at the December 31, 2009 rates, (iii) assume that our existing debt is repaid at maturity and (iv) excludes interest payments on capital leases which are included in Capital leases. (3) Represents our obligations to purchase goods and services whereby the underlying agreements are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. The more significant purchase obligations include: obligations to purchase goods and services, employment contracts, sponsorship agreements and transmission services. Amounts related to employment contracts include base compensation and do not include compensation contingent on future events. 55 Table of Contents We are subject to a contractual agreement that may require us to acquire the non controlling interest of certain of our subsidiaries. The amount and timing of such payments are not currently known and, accordingly, are not included in the table above. We have recorded a $49 million liability as of December 31, 2009 for this redemption right. Refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no material off balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S K) that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. Critical accounting policies impact the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates. An appreciation of our critical accounting policies facilitates an understanding of our financial results. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimates methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. For further information regarding these critical accounting policies and estimates, please see the Notes to our consolidated financial statements. For financial reporting purposes, we are the successor reporting entity to DHC. Because there is no effective change in ownership, in accordance with ASC 810, both DHC and DCH have been consolidated in our financial statements as if the transaction had occurred January 1, 2008. Our critical accounting policies were adopted from DCH following the Newhouse Transaction. For purposes of analyzing our critical accounting policies, we present associated 2008 financial information consistent with our financial statement presentation and present associated 2007 financial information consistent with the financial statement presentation of DCH. Revenues We derive revenues from (i) distribution revenues from cable systems, satellite operators and other distributors, (ii) advertising aired on our networks and websites, and (iii) other, which is largely educational sales, e commerce sales, and post production sound and service sales. Distribution Distributors generally pay a per subscriber fee for the right to distribute our programming under the terms of long term distribution contracts (distribution revenues). Distribution revenues are reported net of incentive costs or other consideration, if any, offered to system operators in exchange for long term distribution contracts. We recognize distribution revenues over the term of the contracts based on contracted monthly license fee provisions and reported subscriber levels. Network incentives have historically included upfront cash incentives referred to as launch incentive in connection with the launch of a network by the distributor within certain time frames. Any such amounts are capitalized as assets upon launch of our programming by the distributor and are amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction of revenue over the terms of the contracts. In instances where the distribution agreement is extended prior to the expiration of the original term, we evaluate the economics of the extended term and, if it is determined that the deferred launch asset continues to benefit us over the extended term, then we will adjust the launch amortization period accordingly. Other incentives are recognized as a reduction of revenue as incurred. The amount of distribution revenues due to us is reported by distributors based on actual subscriber levels. Such information is generally not received until after the close of the reporting period. Therefore, reported distribution revenues are based upon our estimates of the number of subscribers receiving our programming for the month, plus an adjustment for the prior month estimate. Our subscriber estimates are based on the most recent remittance or confirmation of subscribers received from the distributor. Advertising We record advertising revenues net of agency commissions and audience deficiency liabilities in the period advertising spots are broadcast. A substantial portion of the advertising sold in the United States includes guaranteed levels of audience that either the program or the advertisement will reach. Deferred revenue is recorded and adjusted as the guaranteed audience levels are achieved. 56 Table of Contents Audience guarantees are initially developed by our internal research group and actual audience and delivery information is provided by third party ratings services. In certain instances, the third party ratings information is not received until after the close of the reporting period. In these cases, reported advertising revenues and related deferred revenue are based on our estimates for any under delivery of contracted advertising ratings based on the most current data available from the third party ratings service. Differences between the estimated under delivery and the actual under delivery have historically been insignificant. Online advertising revenues are recognized as impressions are delivered. Certain of our advertising arrangements include deliverables in addition to commercial time, such as the advertisers product integration into the programming, customized vignettes, and billboards. These contracts that include other deliverables are evaluated as multiple element revenue arrangements under FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605). Other Other revenues primarily consist of revenues from our Education, CSS, advertising representation, and Commerce businesses. Educational service sales are generally recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. CSS services revenues are recognized when services are performed. Revenues from post production, advertising representation, and certain distribution related services are recognized when services are provided. Prepayments received for services to be performed at a later date are deferred. Commerce revenues are recognized upon product shipment, net of estimated returns, which are not material to our consolidated financial statements. Content Rights Costs incurred in the direct production, co production or licensing of content rights are capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost, fair value, or net realizable value. In accordance with FASBs position on accounting by producers or distributors of films, FASB ASC Topic 926, Entertainment Films (ASC 926), we amortize our content assets based upon the ratio of current revenue to total estimated revenue (ultimate revenue). To determine this ratio, we analyze historical and projected usage for similar programming and apply such usage factors to projected revenues by network, adjusted for any future significant programming strategy changes. The result of this policy is an accelerated amortization pattern for the fully distributed U.S. Networks segment (Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet) and Discovery Channel in the International Networks segment over a period of no more than four years. The accelerated amortization pattern results in the amortization of approximately 40% to 50% of the program cost during the first year. Topical or current events programming is amortized over shorter periods based on the nature of the programming and may be expensed upon its initial airing. All other networks in the U.S. Networks segment and International Networks segment utilize up to a five year useful life. For these networks, with programming investment levels lower than the established networks and higher reuse of programming, straight line amortization is considered a reasonable estimate of the use of content consistent with the pace of earning ultimate revenue. Ultimate revenue assessments include advertising and affiliate revenue streams. Ancillary revenue is considered immaterial to the assessment. Changes in managements assumptions, such as changes in expected use, could significantly alter our estimates for amortization. On a periodic basis, management evaluates the net realizable value of content in conjunction with our strategic review of the business. If we expect to alter the planned use of programming because of a change in network strategy, the unamortized balance is adjusted to net realizable value when we identify the need to alter the planned use. Changes in managements assumptions, such as changes in expected use, could significantly alter our estimates for write offs. Share Based Compensation We have incentive plans under which cash settled unit awards, stock appreciation rights (SARs), stock options, and restricted stock units (RSUs) were issued. We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for cash settled unit awards and SARs based on the fair value of the award less estimated forfeitures. Because unit awards and SARs are cash settled, we remeasure the fair value of outstanding unit awards and SARs each reporting period until settlement. Compensation expense, including changes in fair value, for unit awards and SARs is recognized during the vesting period in proportion to the requisite service that has been rendered at the reporting date. For grants of unit awards with graded vesting, we measure fair value and record compensation expense for the grant as a single award. For grants of SARs with graded vesting, we measure fair value and record compensation expense separately for each tranche. Changes in the fair value of outstanding unit awards and SARs that occur subsequent to the vesting period are recorded as adjustments to compensation costs in the period in which the changes occur. We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock options and RSUs based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant less estimated forfeitures. For awards that vest based on service, compensation expense is recognized ratably during the vesting period. Vesting of certain RSUs is also subject to satisfying operating performance conditions. At the time that we determine that it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved, compensation expense is recorded for such awards. When recording compensation cost for share based awards, we are required to estimate the number of awards granted that are expected to be forfeited. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant based on historical forfeiture rates. On an ongoing basis, we adjust compensation expense based on actual forfeitures and revise the forfeiture rate as necessary. The fair value of unvested cash settled unit awards, unvested SARs, and all stock options are estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Because the Black Scholes option pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of awards. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the award. For cash settled award units and RSUs, the expected term is the period from the grant date to the vesting date of the award. For SARs, the expected term is estimated to be the contractual term of the award. For stock options, the expected term is estimated to be the period from the date of grant through the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the award. Expected volatility is based on a combination of implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical realized volatility of our common stock, and considers other factors deemed relevant. The dividend yield is assumed to be 0% because we have no present intention to pay dividends. The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the fair value of our common stock as of the grant date. Share based compensation expense is recorded as a component of Selling, general and administrative expense. We classify as a current liability the intrinsic value of cash settled award units and SARs that are vested or will become vested within one year. Excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock options are reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid in cash flow from operations on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 57 Table of Contents Goodwill and Indefinite lived Intangible Assets 2009 Impairment Testing The majority of our goodwill balance is the result of the Newhouse Transaction in 2008 and a transaction with Advance/Newhouse and Cox Communications Holdings, Inc. in 2007 (the Cox Transaction). As a result of the Newhouse Transaction, we allocated $1.8 billion of goodwill previously allocated to DHCs equity investment in DCH and $251 million of goodwill for the basis differential between the carrying value of DHCs and Advance/Newhouses investments in DCH to our reporting units. The formation of DCH as part of the Cox Transaction required pushdown accounting of each shareholders basis in DCH. The result was the pushdown of $4.6 billion of additional goodwill previously recorded on the investors books to DCH reporting units. We performed our annual goodwill impairment testing in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (ASC 350) on November 30, 2009. Under the guidelines established by FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting (ASC 280), we have aggregated our operating segments into the following three reportable segments: U.S. Networks, International Networks, and Commerce, Education, and Other. However, the goodwill impairment analysis, under the requirements of ASC 350, is performed at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is the same as, or one level below, an operating segment as defined in ASC 280. The following table presents our goodwill balances, by reporting unit, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in millions). As ofDecember 31, 2009 2008 Discovery Channel $ 2,284 $ 2,284 TLC 1,551 1,551 Animal Planet 313 313 Other U.S. Networks 967 1,421 Total U.S. Networks 5,115 5,569 U.K. 181 181 EMEA 695 693 Latin America 231 230 Asia Pacific 164 164 Antenna Audio 5 Total International Networks 1,271 1,273 Commerce 20 22 Education 16 16 Creative Sound Services 11 11 Total Commerce, Education, and Other 47 49 Total Goodwill $ 6,433 $ 6,891 We utilized a discounted cash flow (DCF) model and market approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. The DCF model utilizes projected financial results for each reporting unit. The projected financial results are created from critical assumptions and estimates which are based on managements business plans and historical trends. The market approach relies on data from publicly traded guideline companies. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, and relevant comparable company earnings multiples. A summary of the critical assumptions utilized for our annual impairment tests in 2009 and 2008 are outlined below. We believe this information coupled with our sensitivity analysis considering reporting units whose fair value would not exceed carrying value following a hypothetical reduction in fair value of 10% and 20% provide relevant information to understand our goodwill impairment testing and evaluate our goodwill balances. 58 Table of Contents During 2009, we did not change our reporting units. However, Discovery Kids, a component of the Other U.S. Networks reporting unit, was deconsolidated in 2009 and was not included in the 2009 impairment testing. For the annual goodwill impairment test performed on November 30, 2009, we did not significantly change the methodology from 2008 to determine the fair value of our reporting units. Due to the improvement in the global economic environment, we made changes to certain of the assumptions utilized in the DCF model for 2009 compared with the prior year. Generally we decreased discount rates in our 2009 DCF calculations. Our assumed growth rates in 2009 were generally consistent with growth rates used in 2008. The following is a summary analysis of the significant assumptions used in our DCF model, as well as a sensitivity analysis on the impact of changes in certain assumptions to our overall conclusion concerning impairment of our goodwill balances. Discount rate: The discount rate represents the expected return on capital. Each of the U.S. Networks reporting units used a discount rate of 11% for 2009, which represents a decrease from a rate of 12% utilized in 2008. The International Networks reporting units discount rates were a weighted average of 14% and 16% for the years 2009 and 2008, respectively. For our remaining reporting units, discount rates were a weighted average of 15% for the years 2009 and 2008. We used the average interest rate of a 20 year government security over a one year period to determine the risk free rate in our weighted average cost of capital calculation. The difference between our discount rate and the risk free rate was 7% and 8% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Growth assumptions: Projected annual growth is primarily driven by assumed advertising sales and cable subscriber trends offset by expected expenses. Other considerations include historical performance and anticipated economic conditions for the current period and long term. We use a five year period of assumed cash flows to assess short term company net free cash flow for our DCF calculation. The projected revenue growth for the U.S. Networks reporting units was a weighted average of 5% for both the 2009 and 2008 DCF calculations. U.S. Networks experienced actual revenue growth of 4% and 10% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The projected expense growth for the U.S. Networks reporting units was a weighted average of 1% in 2009, compared with 5% in 2008. The projected revenue growth for the International Networks reporting units was a weighted average of 7% for both the 2009 and 2008 DCF calculations. International Networks experienced actual revenue growth of 10% and 12% in 2009 and 2008, respectively, when excluding the impacts of foreign exchange. The projected expense growth for the International Networks reporting units was a weighted average of 3% in 2009, compared with 6% in 2008. The projected revenue growth for our other reporting units was a weighted average of 5% for the 2009 DCF calculation, compared with 4% in 2008. Other reporting units experienced actual revenue decreases of 10% and 19% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The historical revenue declines for our other reporting units are not relevant due to the transition of our commerce business to a licensing model in 2009 and the closure of retail stores in the second half of 2007. The projected expense growth for other reporting units was 2% in 2009, compared with a decrease of 1% in 2008. We used a weighted average terminal value growth rate of 4% for the U.S. Networks reporting units in both our 2009 and 2008 DCF calculations. We used a weighted average terminal value growth rate of 4% and 5% for the International Networks reporting units in our 2009 and 2008 DCF calculations, respectively. We used a weighted average terminal value growth rate of 6% and 7% for our other reporting units in our 2009 and 2008 DCF calculations, respectively. The terminal values used in our DCF model are calculated using the dividend discount model. As a result, the terminal values used for our reporting units are a function of their respective discount rates and terminal value growth rates. Market approach assumptions: We used Earnings Before Interest Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), revenue, and price per subscriber multiples to estimate fair value using a market approach. The U.S. Networks reporting units weighted average EBITDA multiples were 13 and 10 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The International Networks reporting units weighted average EBITDA multiples were 13 and 12 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The U.S. Networks reporting units made up 75% of the fair value of our Company in both 2009 and 2008. At the date of impairment testing, the carrying value of our U.S. Networks reporting units made up 74% and 77% of the carrying value of net assets allocated for purposes of goodwill impairment testing in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The International Networks reporting units made up 24% and 23% of the fair value of our Company in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The carrying value of the International Networks reporting units made up 25% and 22% of the carrying value of net assets allocated for purposes of goodwill impairment testing in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The fair value of our other reporting units made up 1% and 2% of the fair value of our Company in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The carrying value of our other reporting units made up 1% of the carrying value of net assets allocated for purposes of goodwill impairment testing in both 2009 and 2008. Impairment: As of November 30, 2009, the fair value of our CSS and Antenna Audio reporting units did not exceed their carrying values due to declines in operating cash flows as a result of adverse market conditions. We performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test as required by ASC 350, which requires calculation of the reporting units implied goodwill and comparing to the book value of goodwill, and determined that $6 million of goodwill of the Antenna Audio reporting unit was impaired. The change in the goodwill balance from December 31, 2008 to the date of the 2009 impairment test was due to foreign exchange. The impairment was recorded as a component of Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 59 Table of Contents Sensitivity Analysis: In order to analyze the sensitivity our assumptions have on our overall impairment assessment, we determined the impact that a hypothetical 10% and 20% reduction in fair value would have on our conclusions. The fair value of the CSS reporting unit does not exceed its carrying value. After performing the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we did not record an impairment for CSS. However, a further 20% decline in fair value would result in a goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2009, the carrying value of goodwill for the CSS reporting unit is $11 million. There were no other reporting units for which a 20% decline in fair value would result in the reporting units carrying value to be in excess of its fair value. Reductions of approximately 47% and 51% in the fair value of our largest reporting units, Discovery Channel and TLC, respectively, would result in their carrying values exceeding their fair values. Given the reductions required and the assumptions used in our fair value modeling at the time of our impairment review, there did not appear to be any likely changes or trigger events that would indicate an impairment of these reporting units. If changes in the fair value of our reporting units caused the carrying value of a reporting unit to exceed its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be required to be performed to determine the ultimate amount of impairment loss to record. 2010 Impairment Testing We will perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill as of November 30, 2010, unless there is a triggering event, which would require the performance of impairment testing before our annual impairment testing date. We monitor our anticipated operating performance to ensure that no event has occurred requiring goodwill impairment testing. As part of our annual impairment testing or any interim impairment test deemed necessary, we will evaluate whether our assumptions and methodologies require changes as a result of the current global economic environment. The determination of recoverability of goodwill requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future cash flows and fair values. Such estimates are subject to change and could result in impairment losses being recognized in the future. If different reporting units or different valuation methodologies had been used, the impairment test results could have differed. Long lived Assets Long lived assets (e.g., amortizing trademarks, customer lists, other intangibles and property, plant and equipment) do not require that an annual impairment test be performed; instead, long lived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Triggering events include the likely (i.e., more likely than not) disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. If the intent is to hold the asset for continued use, the impairment test first requires a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows against the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset would be deemed to not be recoverable. Impairment would then be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by discounting the future cash flows associated with that asset. If the intent is to hold the asset for sale and certain other criteria are met (e.g., the asset can be disposed of currently, appropriate levels of authority have approved the sale, and there is an active program to locate a buyer), the impairment test involves comparing the assets carrying value to its fair value. To the extent the carrying value is greater than the assets fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred, determining the future cash flows for the assets involved and determining the proper discount rate to be applied in determining fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded long lived asset impairments of $26 million primarily related to our HowStuffWorks.com business, a component of the Other U.S. Networks reporting unit, due to declines in expected operating performance. The determination of recoverability of long lived assets requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future cash flows, fair values, and the appropriate grouping of assets. Such estimates are subject to change and could result in impairment losses being recognized in the future. If different asset groupings or different valuation methodologies had been used, the impairment test results could have differed. 60 Table of Contents Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will be unrealized. Recently Issued Accounting and Reporting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk and can be affected by, among other things, economic conditions, interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of investments. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. We use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Interest Rates The nature and amount of our long term debt are expected to vary as a result of future requirements, market conditions and other factors. Our interest expense is exposed to movements in short term interest rates. Of our $3.4 billion of debt excluding capital leases, $2.0 billion was floating rate debt at December 31, 2009. We use derivative instruments, including variable to fixed and fixed to variable interest rate instruments, to modify this exposure. The variable to fixed interest rate instruments had a notional amount of $1.8 billion and $2.3 billion and had a weighted average interest rate of 4.27% and 4.68% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The fixed to variable interest rate agreements had a notional amount of $50 million and had a weighted average interest rate of 4.67% and 7.90% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, we have a notional amount of $300 million of forward starting variable to fixed interest rate swaps, which will start in June 2010. The fair value of our interest rate derivative contracts, adjusted for our credit risk and our counterparties credit risk, aggregate a net loss position of $33 million and $107 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of the total notional amount of $2.2 billion in interest rate derivatives, $1.8 billion of these derivative instruments are highly effective cash flow hedges. The fair value of these hedges at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was a net loss position of $17 million and $71 million, respectively, with changes in the mark to market value recorded as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss). We do not expect material hedge ineffectiveness in the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2009, a parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve equal to one percentage point would change the fair value of our interest rate derivative portfolio by approximately $40 million. In addition, a change of one percentage point in interest rates on our variable rate debt would impact interest expense by approximately $3 million on an annual basis. We continually monitor our positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our derivative instruments and do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. In addition, we limit the amount of derivative counterparty credit exposure with any one institution. Refer to Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our interest rate derivative instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We continually monitor our economic exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may enter into foreign exchange agreements when appropriate. Substantially all of our foreign transactions are denominated in foreign currencies, including the liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our foreign currency exposure is to the British pound and the Euro. Although our foreign transactions are not generally subject to significant foreign exchange transaction gains or losses, the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars as part of our consolidated financial reporting. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations. Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows. Accordingly, we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments that change in value as foreign exchange rates change. We did not hold significant foreign currency derivative instruments at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments was $75 million and the fair value was $5 million. Refer to Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivative instruments. 62 Table of Contents
