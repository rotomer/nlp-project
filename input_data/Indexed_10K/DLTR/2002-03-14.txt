Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Key Events and Recent Developments Several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations. You should keep in mind that: o In January 2002, we completed the expansion and automation of our California distribution center, which increased the size to 525,000 square feet. o In August 2001, we opened a new 600,000 square foot automated distribution center in Pennsylvania. This new facility replaced our former distribution facilities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. o In January 2001, we opened a new 600,000 square foot automated distribution center in Georgia. o In May 2000, we merged with Dollar Express and issued or reserved 9,000,000 shares of our common stock in exchange for Dollar Expresss outstanding stock and options. Dollar Express operated 132 stores primarily in the Mid Atlantic region. o In January 2000, we opened a new 317,000 square foot distribution center in California, which replaced our Sacramento, California facility. o In June 1999, we merged with Only $One, issuing 752,400 shares of our common stock in exchange for Only $Ones outstanding stock. Only $One operated 24 stores in central and upstate New York. o In January 1999, we opened a new 425,000 square foot distribution center in Mississippi, which replaced our Memphis, Tennessee facility. We accounted for the Dollar Express and Only $One mergers as poolings of interest. As a result, all financial and operational data assume that Dollar Express and Only $One had each been a part of Dollar Tree throughout all periods presented. For each period presented, the outstanding Dollar Express and Only $One shares of stock have been converted into Dollar Tree shares based on the exchange ratios used in each merger. Results of Operations Our net sales derive from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions. Second, sales may vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. We refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales, because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared. We include expanded stores in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. The term expanded also includes stores that are relocated. Most retailers have the ability to increase the price of their merchandise in order to increase their comparable store net sales. As a fixed price retailer, we do not have the ability to raise our prices. Generally, our comparable store net sales will increase only if we sell more merchandise. Our plans for 2002 operations are based on comparable store net sales increases between 0% and 2%, but we are unable to predict actual comparable store net sales. In addition, we expect net sales to increase approximately 18% in 2002. We expect the substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come from square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of existing stores. In 2002, we plan to increase our selling square footage approximately 25%, or approximately 2.3 million square feet, by adding 300 net new stores and 0.4 million square feet by expanding approximately 100 stores. We expect the average size of new stores opened in 2002 to average approximately 7,250 selling square feet per store. In 2002 and beyond, we plan to predominately open stores that are approximately 7,000 to 10,000 selling square feet. We will also continue to open stores ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 selling square feet as opportunities arise. Stores of this size continue to offer strong store level economics and allow us to optimize our strategic approach for a particular market. While our newer, larger stores have lower sales per square foot than older, smaller stores, they generate higher sales and operating income per store and create an improved shopping environment that invites customers to shop longer and buy more. We must control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses. Increases in expenses could negatively impact our operating results because we cannot pass on increased expenses to our customers by increasing our merchandise price above the $1.00 price point. 11 We will continue to experience pressure on our gross profit margins in future years as we refine our merchandise mix to include a higher proportion of consumable merchandise, which typically carries a lower gross profit margin, open larger stores and continue to absorb higher costs. We do expect to partially offset the effect of the above factors with improved domestic freight costs created by the addition of our two new distribution centers in 2001. Even with our changing merchandise mix, we expect our gross profit margin will range between 36.0% and 37.0% in the foreseeable future because we can vary the mix among our consumable products and variety categories to impact our gross margin. In addition, consumable merchandise typically sells more quickly than our other merchandise, resulting in increased sales. Leveraging our selling, general and administrative expenses is difficult because a substantial majority of our future sales growth is expected to come primarily from new store openings, rather than comparable store net sales. The following table expresses items from our income statement as a percentage of net sales: Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net sales.................................................. 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of sales.............................................. 64.0 63.0 63.2 Merger related costs....................................... 0.1 Gross profit............................................... 36.0 36.9 36.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses: Operating expenses................................... 23.0 22.2 21.5 Merger related expenses.............................. 0.2 Depreciation and amortization........................ 2.7 2.5 2.3 Total............................................ 25.7 24.9 23.8 Operating income........................................... 10.3 12.0 13.0 Interest income............................................ 0.2 0.3 0.1 Interest expense........................................... (0.3) (0.5) (0.5) Other, net................................................. (0.1) Income before income taxes................................. 10.1 11.8 12.6 Provision for income taxes................................. 3.9 4.6 4.7 Net income................................................. 6.2% 7.2% 7.9% 2001 Compared to 2000 Net Sales. Net sales increased 17.7% in 2001 compared to 2000. We attribute this $299.2 increase in net sales primarily to our new stores opened in 2001 and 2000, which are not included in our comparable store net sales results. Comparable store net sales increased 0.1% in 2001. We believe comparable store net sales remained relatively flat in 2001 because the retail environment in 2001 was unusually difficult in light of the economic downturn and the events of September 11, 2001. In addition, our Easter selling season was shorter in 2001 compared to 2000 because Easter was approximately one week earlier in 2001 than 2000. We opened 276 new stores and closed 30 stores during 2001, compared to 233 new stores opened and 11 stores closed in 2000. We added 29.6% to our selling square footage in 2001 compared to 27.9% in 2000. Of the 2.3 million, or 29.6%, increase in selling square footage in 2001, approximately 0.4 million selling square feet was added by expanding 111 existing stores. Gross Profit. Excluding $1.1 million of merger related costs, gross profit margin decreased to 36.0% in 2001 compared to 37.0% in 2000. This decrease in gross profit margin in 2001 was primarily due to loss of leverage on occupancy costs and increases in shrink in the now closed Philadelphia distribution facilities. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Excluding $3.3 million of merger related expenses in 2000, selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to 25.7% compared to 24.7% in 2000. This increase is primarily the result of increases in payroll related costs, including insurance; certain store operating expenses; and charges recorded in connection with our closed distribution facilities in Philadelphia. The increase in payroll related costs and store operating expenses was primarily due to the loss of leverage. Expressed as a percentage of net sales, depreciation and amortization increased to 2.7% in 2001 from 2.5% in 2000, a total increase of $11.8 million. The increase as a percent of net sales was due primarily to loss of leverage. The $11.8 million increase is due primarily to new stores and expansions in 2001 and to stores opened in 2000 being opened a full year in 2001. 12 Operating Income. Due to the reasons discussed above, excluding $4.4 million of merger related items in 2000, operating income decreased to $203.9 million in 2001 from $207.4 million in 2000 and decreased as a percentage of net sales to 10.3% from 12.3%. Interest Income and Expense. Interest income decreased $0.7 million in 2001 compared to 2000. The decrease resulted primarily because of decreased interest rates throughout 2001. Interest expense decreased $2.4 million in 2001 compared to 2000. This decrease was primarily due to the payoff of a revolving credit facility and term loan in May 2000. We benefited slightly from the decrease in variable interest rates in 2001 because of our variable rate operating leases and variable rate debt. However, this benefit was partially offset as a result of the interest rate swaps in effect during 2001. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate decreased to 38.5% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 38.8% for the year ended December 31, 2000 because 2000 included certain non deductible merger related expenses related to Dollar Express. 2000 Compared to 1999 Net Sales. Net sales increased 24.9% in 2000 compared to 1999. We attribute this $336.3 million increase in net sales to two factors: o Approximately 79% of the increase came from stores opened in 2000 and 1999, which are not included in our comparable store net sales calculation. o Approximately 21% of the increase came from comparable store net sales increases. Comparable store net sales increased 5.7% during 2000. We believe comparable store net sales increased in 2000 because we improved our merchandise mix to offer more consumable products as a component of our domestic merchandise and the Easter selling season was longer in 2000 compared to 1999. We opened 233 new stores and closed 11 stores during 2000, compared to 227 new stores opened and five stores closed in 1999. We added 27.9% to our selling square footage in 2000 compared to 25.6% in 1999. Of the 1.7 million, or 27.9%, increase in selling square footage in 2000, approximately 0.3 million selling square feet was added by expanding 98 existing stores. Gross Profit. Excluding $1.1 million of merger related costs in 2000, gross profit margin increased to 37.0% in 2000 compared to 36.8% in 1999. The increase in gross margin in 2000 was primarily due to decreased merchandise costs primarily as a result of our increased purchasing power and a slightly higher percentage of import merchandise. These savings were partially offset by increased freight costs caused by increased domestic fuel costs and the higher mix of consumable products as a percentage of our domestic merchandise. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Excluding $3.3 million of expenses related to the Dollar Express merger in 2000, selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to 24.7% compared to 23.8% in 1999. This increase is primarily the result of a loss of leverage during the important fourth quarter selling season, non recurring Dollar Express expenses of approximately $3.3 million and an increase in our workers compensation and general liability accruals resulting from a change in our estimates. The $3.3 million in non recurring Dollar Express expenses primarily includes: o accrual of tax liabilities; o training Dollar Express store personnel on new systems, policies and procedures; o conducting physical inventories of Dollar Express stores; and o improving benefits and paying transitional salaries. Expressed as a percentage of net sales, depreciation and amortization increased to 2.5% in 2000 from 2.3% in 1999, a total increase of $11.2 million. The increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to approximately $1.4 million of accelerated depreciation related to Dollar Expresss store equipment and warehouse management system. We replaced the Dollar Express warehouse management system in January 2001 with our own, which we believe increased the visibility of merchandise in our Philadelphia distribution center and improved merchandise flow and our store ordering system. We estimate that Dollar Express was approximately $0.04 dilutive to our diluted earnings per share in 2000, excluding merger related items. Operating Income. Due to the reasons discussed above, excluding $4.4 million of merger related items in 2000, operating income decreased as a percentage of net sales to 12.3% from 13.1%. 13 Interest Income and Expense. Interest income increased $2.6 million in 2000 compared to 1999. The increase resulted from higher levels of cash and cash equivalents in 2000 compared to 1999. Interest expense increased $0.4 million in 2000 compared to 1999. Interest expense increased because we incurred interest on the sale leaseback transaction for the entire year in 2000 compared to only three months in 1999. This increase was partially offset by the decrease in interest on the revolving credit facility and term loan paid off in May 2000. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate increased to 38.8% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 37.3% for the year ended December 31, 1999 because the 1999 rate included a benefit of approximately 1.3%, as a percentage of income before taxes, related to Dollar Expresss conversion from an S to C corporation and 0.3% related to the non taxable S corporation income of Only $One in the first half of 1999. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our business requires capital to open new stores and operate existing stores. Our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in September and October. Historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and funded our store opening and expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities. The following table compares cash related information for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999: Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities..................................... $ 178.7 $ 107.3 $ 128.6 Investing activities..................................... (121.5) (94.8) (55.2) Financing activities..................................... (1.8) (12.9) 23.5 The $71.4 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2001 was caused primarily by an approximate $72.8 million increase in working capital. Cash used in investing activities is generally expended to open new stores. The $26.7 million increase in 2001 compared to 2000 in investing activities was primarily due to the following: o We increased the number of new stores opened and the average size of those stores in 2001. o We expanded 111 stores in 2001 compared to 98 stores in 2000 while also increasing the size of those expanded stores. o We invested in technology to improve our supply chain processes. The $11.1 million decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of the following: o We made a $6.0 million principal payment on the senior notes in 2001. In 2000, we made net repayments of approximately $34.2 million due to repayment of Dollar Expresss term loan and revolving credit facility and the first principal payment on the senior notes. o We received $12.8 million less cash pursuant to stock based compensation plans in 2001 compared to 2000 because of a decrease in the amount of stock option exercises, which we believe resulted from the decreased stock price throughout 2001. o We paid $3.8 million in 2001 to repurchase shares in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Emergency Relief Order, which has since expired. At December 31, 2001, our long term borrowings were $37.0 million. We had $50.0 million available through a revolving credit facility. We also have $125.0 million available under the Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, of which approximately $68.1 million was committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise. 14 Funding Requirements Overview We plan to add approximately 300 net new stores in 2002. In 2001, the average investment per new store, including capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre opening costs, was approximately $360,000. We expect our cash needs for opening new stores in 2002 to total approximately $112.6 million, which includes approximately $67.6 million for capital expenditures and $45.0 million for initial inventory and pre opening costs. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $25.1 million to expand 100 stores in 2002. Our total planned capital expenditures for 2002 are approximately $135.0 to $140.0 million, including planned expenditures for new and expanded stores, investments in our supply chain processes and additional equipment for the distribution centers. We believe that we can adequately fund our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. The following tables summarize our material contractual obligations, including both on and off balance sheet arrangements, and our commitments (in millions) at December 31, 2001: Contractual Obligations Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Lease Financing Operating lease obligations $658.0 $126.2 $118.1 $104.0 $ 82.8 $141.1 $ 85.8 (including distribution center operating lease facility) Capital lease obligations 32.0 6.0 5.9 6.4 7.9 5.8 (including sale leaseback) Long term Borrowings Long term debt 37.0 25.0 6.0 6.0 Total obligations $727.0 $157.2 $130.0 $116.4 $ 90.7 $146.9 $ 85.8 Expiring Expiring Expiring Expiring Expiring Commitments Total in 2002 in 2003 in 2004 in 2005 in 2006 Thereafter Revolving credit facility $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 107.4 87.4 20.0 Other commitments 27.2 21.8 5.4 Total commitments $134.6 $109.2 $25.4 $ $ $ $ Commitments Bank Credit Facilities. Effective March 12, 2001, we entered into a revolving credit facility with our banks, which provides for a $50.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for working capital bearing interest at the agent banks prime rate or LIBOR plus a spread, at our option. The credit agreement, among other things, requires the maintenance of specified ratios, restricts the payments of certain distributions and limits certain types of debt we can incur. The facility was scheduled to terminate on March 11, 2002. Effective March 7, 2002, we extended the revolving credit facility to May 31, 2002. Also, effective March 12, 2001, we entered into a Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, which provides $125.0 million for letters of credit, which are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise. Approximately $68.1 million was committed to letters of credit at December 31, 2001. Financial Guarantee. We have issued a guarantee for $20.0 million that is used by one of our suppliers as collateral. The guarantee is secured by letters of credit totaling $20.0 million that expire in 2003. Freight Contracts. We have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through August 2003. The total amount of these commitments is approximately $12.6 million. Surety Bonds. We have issued various surety bonds totaling approximately $14.6 million that expire at various dates through 2003. The surety bonds primarily serve as collateral on our large deductible insurance programs. 15 Lease Facilities Distribution Center Operating Lease Facility. We have entered into operating leases known as synthetic leases for three of our distribution centers. Effective March 12, 2001, we entered into an operating lease facility with a group of financial institutions for $165.0 million, of which approximately $113.0 million is committed to our existing Stockton, Briar Creek and Savannah distribution centers. The distribution centers are owned by a special purpose entity. Under this type of agreement, an unrelated third party borrows funds under a construction agreement, purchases the property, pays for the construction costs and subsequently leases the facility to us. Because these arrangements are accounted for as operating leases, the related fixed assets and lease liabilities are not included on our balance sheet. The termination date of this operating lease facility is March 2006. At termination, we must select from one of the following alternatives: o We may purchase any or all of the distribution centers for the sum of the amounts due and outstanding under the lease and any costs and expenses incurred to exercise the purchase option (approximately $113.0 million to purchase all distribution centers). o We may sell any or all of the distribution centers to a third party, subject to a guarantee that the lessor will receive no less than 83% of the property cost plus any unpaid interest and rents under the lease agreement. (This obligation, which could total as much as $92.8 million, is included in future operating lease commitments in 2006). We have not yet determined what course of action we will take upon termination of the existing facility; however, we believe it is unlikely that we will vacate those distribution centers upon termination in 2006. We believe that we will have sufficient cash or financing capabilities to execute one of the available alternatives. In addition, we may be able to negotiate a new lease term based on fair market values at the time of termination. The lease facility, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and limits certain types of debt we can incur. Changes are currently being proposed to the current accounting for synthetic leases, which may make them less desirable in the future. The proposed changes in the required accounting for these transactions may adversely affect our results of operations and our consolidated balance sheets. Sale Leaseback Transaction. In September 1999, we sold some retail store leasehold improvements to an unrelated third party and leased them back for seven years. We have an option to repurchase the leasehold improvements in September 2004 and September 2006 at amounts approximating their fair market values at the time the option is exercised. The transaction is treated as a financing arrangement for financial accounting purposes. The total amount of the lease obligation is $23.4 million. We are required to make monthly lease payments of $438,000 in the first five years and $638,000 in the sixth and seventh years. As a result of the transaction, we received net cash of $20.9 million and an $8.1 million 11.0% note receivable, which matures in September 2006. The amount of the lease obligation will equal the amount outstanding under the note receivable in September 2006. Long Term Borrowings Revenue Bond Financing. In May 1998, we entered into an agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation under which it issued $19.0 million of variable rate demand revenue bonds. We borrowed the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition, construction and installation of land, buildings, machinery and equipment for our new distribution facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi. At December 31, 2001, the balance outstanding on the bonds was $19.0 million. We begin repayment of the principal amount of the bonds in June 2006, with a portion maturing each June 1 until the final portion matures in June 2018. The bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable. The bonds contain a demand provision and, therefore, outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities. We pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate, which was 2.2% at December 31, 2001. The bonds are secured by a $19.3 million letter of credit issued by one of our existing lending banks. The letter of credit is renewable annually. The letter of credit and reimbursement agreement require that we maintain specified financial ratios and restrict our ability to pay cash dividends. Debt Securities. In April 1997, we issued $30.0 million of 7.29% unsecured senior notes. We used the proceeds to pay down a portion of the revolving credit facility, which enabled us to use that credit facility to fund capital expenditures for the Chesapeake corporate headquarters and distribution center. We pay interest on the notes semiannually on April 30 and October 30 each year and we pay principal in five equal annual installments of $6.0 million, which began April 30, 2000. The note holders have the right to require us to prepay the notes in full without premium upon a change of control or upon specified asset dispositions or other transactions we may make. The note agreements prohibit specified mergers and consolidations in which our company is not the surviving company, require that we maintain specified financial ratios, require that the notes rank on par with other debt and limit the amount of debt we can incur. In the event of default or a prepayment at our option, we must pay a penalty to the note holder. 16 Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative Financial Instruments. We are party to four interest rate swaps, which allow us to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds and a portion of our variable rate operating leases. The swaps are based on notional amounts of $19.0 million, $10.0 million, $5.0 million and $25.0 million. Under the $19.0 million, $10.0 million and $5.0 million agreements, as amended, we pay interest to the banks that provided the swaps at a fixed rate. In exchange, the financial institution pays us at variable interest rates, which are similar to the rates on the demand revenue bonds and our variable rate operating leases. The variable interest rates on the interest rate swaps are set monthly. No payments are made by either party under the swaps for monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than a predetermined rate (the knock out rate). The swaps may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates. The $25.0 million interest rate swap agreement is used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our variable rate operating leases. Under this agreement, we pay interest to a financial institution at a fixed rate of 5.43%. In exchange, the financial institution pays us at a variable interest rate, which approximates the floating rate on the lease agreement, excluding the credit spread. The interest rate on the swap is subject to adjustment monthly. The swap is effective through March 2006, but it may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates. Because of the knock out provision in the $19.0 million, $10.0 million and $5.0 million interest rate swaps, changes in the fair value of those swaps are recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value on our $25.0 million interest rate swap are recorded as a component of "accumulated other comprehensive income" in the consolidated balance sheets because the swap qualifies for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138. The amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the related interest affects earnings. For more information on the interest rate swaps, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk" on page 20. Critical Accounting Policies Inventory Valuation As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a FIFO basis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. The retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis. Inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments. These include estimates of merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. The averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns may, under certain circumstances, result in inaccurate cost figures. Inaccurate inventory cost may be caused by applying the retail inventory method to a group of products that have differing characteristics related to gross margin and turnover. We estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or carryover seasonal merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of markdowns compared with actual results. Our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. The majority of our counts are taken in the first and second quarters of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at December 31, 2001 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2001, including the fourth quarter. We have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates in our Dollar Tree stores. However, we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition, as was experienced in the former Dollar Express distribution facilities and stores in 2001. We periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent. Our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market. 17 Accrued Expenses On a monthly basis, we estimate certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred. Our most material estimates relate to domestic freight, insurance related expenses and certain store level operating expenses, such as property taxes and utilities. Our freight and store level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical results. Our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuation methods performed by third party actuaries. These actuarial valuations are estimates based on historical loss development factors. Differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual. Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales, comparable store net sales, operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue. Our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including: o shifts in the timing of certain holidays, especially Easter, which may fall in different quarters from year to year; o the timing of new store openings; o the net sales contributed by new stores; o changes in our merchandise mix; and o competition. Our highest sales periods are the Christmas and Easter seasons. Easter was observed on April 15, 2001 and will be observed on March 31, 2002. In addition, there will be six fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2002 as compared to 2001. The decrease in the selling season results because of the shift of Thanksgiving from November 22, 2001 to November 28, 2002. We generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter. In anticipation of increased sales activity during these months, we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our permanent store staff. Our operating results, particularly operating and net income, could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or Easter season for any reason, including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems. Historically, net sales, operating income and net income have been weakest during the first quarter. We expect this trend to continue. Our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in Footnote 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Inflation and Other Economic Factors Our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors that we cannot control, including inflation in shipping rates, wage rates and other operating costs. Shipping Costs. In the past, we have experienced annual increases of as much as 33% in our trans Pacific shipping rates due primarily to rate increases imposed by the trans Pacific shipping cartel. Currently, trans Pacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers. As a result, our trans Pacific shipping rates may increase when we renegotiate our import shipping rates effective May 2002. During 2000, we experienced a $1.2 million increase in our domestic freight costs because of increased domestic fuel costs. During 2001, we experienced a $0.4 million increase in freight costs compared to 2000 resulting from increased domestic fuel costs. Given the stabilization of fuel costs throughout 2001, we do not expect fuel surcharges to materially affect our domestic freight costs in 2002. We may experience disruptions in receiving shipments at our West coast ports because of the possibility of a strike by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union beginning July 1, 2002, the date their current labor agreement expires. We are formulating appropriate contingency plans to minimize the impact that a strike could have on our receiving and distribution operations. 18 Minimum Wage. Although our average hourly wage rate is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage, an increase in the mandated minimum wage could significantly increase our payroll costs. In February 2000, the U.S. Senate approved a proposal increasing the federal minimum wage by $1.00 per hour over three years. In March 2000, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a proposal increasing the federal minimum wage by $1.00 per hour over two years. No bill was passed into law and the status of this issue in the 2002 Congress is uncertain. If the federal minimum wage were to increase by $1.00 per hour, we believe that our annual payroll expenses would increase by approximately 2.0% to 2.5% of operating expenses unless we realize offsetting cost reductions. Leases for Replaced Distribution Centers. We are liable for rent and pass through costs under leases for now closed distribution centers whose leases expire at various dates through December 2009. Annual rent and pass through costs on these facilities are approximately $3.2 million in 2002, $2.2 million in 2003 and 2004, $2.0 in 2005, $1.3 million in 2006 and 2007, $1.0 million in 2008 and $0.7 million in 2009. Certain of these distribution facilities have been subleased under agreements expiring at various dates through June 2008. We have recorded charges for these future obligations for certain of the facilities considering current market conditions and probable sublease income at each location. Unless offsetting cost savings are realized, adverse economic factors, including inflation in operating costs, could harm our financial condition and results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 and 142 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, "Business Combinations," requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," establishes accounting standards for intangible assets and goodwill and is effective January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Application of the non amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142 is expected to result in a reduction in amortization expense of approximately $2.0 million per year. We performed the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill as of January 1, 2002, to evaluate existing goodwill for impairment upon adoption of SFAS No. 142. Based on the transition impairment tests performed on recorded goodwill and other intangibles, we will not record a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in connection with the adoption of the provisions of this standard. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and or normal use of the asset. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Our management does not believe the implementation of this standard will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," which requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. SFAS No. 144 requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of (by sale, abandonment, or in a distribution to owners) or is classified as held for sale. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of." SFAS No. 144 is effective beginning January 1, 2002. Our management does not believe the implementation of this standard will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 19 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency rate fluctuations. We may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes, and we may employ other risk management strategies, including the use of foreign currency forward contracts. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, consisting of debt and lease obligations issued at variable and fixed rates. Based on amounts outstanding on our fixed rate debt obligations at December 31, 2001, we do not consider our exposure to interest rate risk to be material. We use variable rate debt and variable rate operating leases to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements. These obligations expose us to variability in interest and rent payments due to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, interest and or rent expense increase. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, interest and or rent expense also decrease. We believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest and rent payments. To meet this objective, we entered into derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variable interest rates on the obligations. The interest rate swaps reduce the interest rate exposure on these variable rate obligations. Under the interest rate swap, we pay the bank at a fixed rate and receive variable interest at a rate approximating the variable rate on the obligation, thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed rate obligation. Under the $19.0 million, $10.0 million and $5.0 million interest rate swaps, no payments are made by parties under the swaps for monthly periods in which the variable interest rate is greater than the predetermined knock out rate. The following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap agreements and the fair value of each interest rate swap at December 31, 2001: Hedging Receive Pay Knockout Fair Instrument Variable Fixed Rate Expiration Value $19.0 million LIBOR 4.88% 7.75% 4/1/09 ($0.7 million) interest rate swap $10.0 million LIBOR 6.45% 7.41% 6/2/04 ($0.7 million) interest rate swap $5.0 million LIBOR 5.83% 7.41% 6/2/04 ($0.3 million) interest rate swap $25.0 million LIBOR 5.43% N/A 3/12/06 ($0.7 million) interest rate swap Hypothetically, a 1% change in interest rates results in approximately a $0.6 million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements on an annual basis. Due to many factors, management is not able to predict the changes in fair value of our interest rate swaps. The fair values are the estimated amounts we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements as of the reporting date. These fair values are obtained from an outside financial institution. Foreign Currency Risk Although we purchase most of our imported goods with U.S. dollars, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to payments to suppliers in Euros (formerly Italian lire). When favorable exchange rates exist, we may hedge foreign currency commitments of future payments by purchasing foreign currency forward contracts. On December 31, 2001, we had no contracts outstanding. Less than 1% of our purchases are contracted in Euros, and the market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rate fluctuations is not material. 20
