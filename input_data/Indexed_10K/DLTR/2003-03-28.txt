Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company, including: o what factors affect our business; o what our earnings and costs were in 2002 and 2001; o why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; o how all of this affects our overall financial condition; o what our expenditures for capital projects were in 2002 and what we expect them to be in 2003; and o where funds will come from to pay for future expenditures. As you read Managements Discussion and Analysis, please refer to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, which present the results of operations for 2002, 2001 and 2000. In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements. Key Events and Recent Developments Several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations. You should keep in mind that: o In February 2003, we opened a new 603,000 square foot automated distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma. o In January 2003, we changed our fiscal year from a calendar year to a retail fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Our first fiscal year reported will be fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 is the period beginning February 2, 2003 and ending January 31, 2004. o In April 2002, we implemented a new supply chain management system. o In January 2002, we completed the expansion and automation of our Stockton, California distribution center, which increased the size to 525,000 square feet. This distribution center opened in January 2000 and replaced the former 98 Cent Clearance Center facility in Sacramento, California. o In August 2001, we opened a new 600,000 square foot automated distribution center in Briar Creek, Pennsylvania. This new facility replaced the former Dollar Express distribution facilities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. o In January 2001, we opened a new 600,000 square foot automated distribution center in Savannah, Georgia. o In May 2000, we merged with Dollar Express and issued or reserved 9,000,000 shares of our common stock in exchange for Dollar Express outstanding stock and options. Dollar Express operated 132 stores primarily in the Mid Atlantic region. We accounted for the Dollar Express merger as a pooling of interests. As a result, all financial and operational data assume that Dollar Express had been a part of Dollar Tree throughout all periods presented. For each period presented, the outstanding Dollar Express shares of stock have been converted into Dollar Tree shares based on the exchange ratio used in the merger. 12 Results of Operations Our net sales derive from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions. Second, sales may vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. We refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales, because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared. We include expanded stores in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. The term expanded also includes stores that are relocated. Most retailers have the ability to increase their merchandise prices or alter the mix of their merchandise to favor higher priced items in order to increase their comparable store net sales. As a fixed price retailer, we do not have the ability to raise our prices. Generally, our comparable store net sales will increase only if we sell more merchandise. Our plans for fiscal 2003 operations anticipate comparable store net sales increases of 0% to 1% and net sales and earnings increases of at least 15% based on fiscal 2002 earnings of $1.27 per share. We may be unable to predict our actual operating results accurately. We expect the substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come from square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of existing stores. In fiscal 2003, we plan to increase our selling square footage approximately 22%, or approximately 2.9 million square feet, 0.9 million of which will come from expansions. We expect the average size of new stores opened in fiscal 2003 to be approximately 9,000 selling square feet per store. In fiscal 2003 and beyond, we plan to predominately open stores that are approximately 8,000 to 10,000 selling square feet. We believe this size range allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand. Larger stores take longer to negotiate, build out and open and generally have lower net sales per square foot than our smaller stores. While our newer, larger stores have lower sales per square foot than older, smaller stores, they generate higher sales and operating income per store and create an improved shopping environment that invites customers to shop longer and buy more. We must control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses. Increases in expenses could negatively impact our operating results because we cannot pass on increased expenses to our customers by increasing our merchandise price above the $1.00 price point. We will continue to experience pressure on our gross profit margins in future years as we refine our merchandise mix to include a higher proportion of consumable merchandise, which typically carries a lower gross profit margin, open larger stores and continue to absorb higher costs. We do expect to partially offset the effect of the above factors with improved domestic freight costs created by the addition of our new distribution center in 2003. Even with our changing merchandise mix, we expect our gross profit margin will approximate 36% in the foreseeable future because we can vary the mix among our consumable products and variety categories to impact our gross margin. In addition, consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores, resulting in increased sales. Leveraging our selling, general and administrative expenses is difficult because a substantial majority of our future sales growth is expected to come primarily from new store openings, rather than from comparable store net sales. The following table expresses items from our income statement as a percentage of net sales: Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net sales.................................................. 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of sales.............................................. 63.6 64.0 63.0 Merger related costs....................................... 0.1 Gross profit............................................... 36.4 36.0 36.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses: Operating expenses................................... 25.5 25.7 24.7 Merger related expenses.............................. 0.2 Total............................................ 25.5 25.7 24.9 Operating income........................................... 10.9 10.3 12.0 Interest income............................................ 0.2 0.2 0.3 Interest expense........................................... (0.2) (0.3) (0.5) Changes in fair value of non hedging interest rate swaps..................................... (0.1) (0.1) Income before income taxes................................. 10.8 10.1 11.8 Provision for income taxes................................. 4.2 3.9 4.6 Net income................................................. 6.6% 6.2% 7.2% 13 2002 Compared to 2001 Net Sales. Net sales increased 17.2% in 2002 compared to 2001. We attribute this $341.9 million increase in net sales primarily to our new stores opened in 2002 and 2001, which are not included in our comparable store net sales increase, and to a comparable store net sales increase of 1.0% in 2002. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores. We opened 318 new stores and closed 30 stores during 2002, compared to 276 new stores opened and 30 stores closed in 2001. During 2002, we opened larger stores than originally planned, which required us to shift our store openings to later in the third quarter and shift some store openings into the fourth quarter. We added 28.8% to our selling square footage in 2002 compared to 29.6% in 2001. Of the 2.9 million in selling square footage increase in 2002, approximately 0.5 million selling square feet was added by expanding 111 existing stores. Our square footage growth in the future will come primarily from larger stores. Gross Profit. Gross profit margin increased to 36.4% in 2002 compared to 36.0% in 2001. This increase in gross profit margin in 2002 was primarily due to improved inventory shrink. This improvement is primarily attributed to lower shrink in our Dollar Express stores and our Philadelphia distribution network and adjustments to our distribution center shrink in connection with our supply chain management system implementation. In addition, merchandise costs increased, but were partially offset by improvements in freight costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to 25.5% compared to 25.7% in 2001. This decrease is primarily the result of savings achieved from our implementation of various expense management initiatives, particularly with regard to payroll related expenses, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in depreciation expense resulted primarily from depreciation costs associated with our new inventory management system, our store relocation and expansion program, and the opening of new larger stores. In addition, effective January 1, 2002, we ceased amortization of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. We recorded approximately $2.0 million of goodwill amortization in 2001. Operating Income. Due to the reasons discussed above, operating income increased to $253.9 million in 2002 from $203.9 million in 2001 and increased as a percentage of net sales to 10.9% from 10.3%. Interest Income and Expense. Interest income in 2002 was consistent with 2001. Decreased interest rates throughout 2002 were offset by increased levels of cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense decreased $0.9 million in 2002 compared to 2001 due to repayments of our long term debt and a decrease in interest on our capitalized leases. We benefited slightly from the decrease in variable interest rates in 2002; however, this benefit was partially offset as a result of the interest rate swaps in effect during 2002. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 38.5% in 2002 and 2001 and we expect the rate to remain the same in fiscal 2003. 2001 Compared to 2000 Net Sales. Net sales increased 17.7% in 2001 compared to 2000. We attribute this $299.2 increase in net sales primarily to our new stores opened in 2001 and 2000, which are not included in our comparable store net sales results. Comparable store net sales increased 0.1% in 2001. We believe comparable store net sales remained relatively flat in 2001 because the retail environment in 2001 was unusually difficult in light of the economic downturn and the events of September 11, 2001. In addition, our Easter selling season was shorter in 2001 compared to 2000 because Easter was approximately one week earlier in 2001 than 2000. We opened 276 new stores and closed 30 stores during 2001, compared to 233 new stores opened and 11 stores closed in 2000. We added 29.6% to our selling square footage in 2001 compared to 27.9% in 2000. Of the 2.3 million selling square footage increase in 2001, approximately 0.4 million selling square feet was added by expanding 111 existing stores. Gross Profit. Excluding $1.1 million of merger related costs recorded in 2000, gross profit margin decreased to 36.0% in 2001 compared to 37.0% in 2000. This decrease in gross profit margin in 2001 was primarily due to loss of leverage on occupancy costs and increases in shrink in the now closed Philadelphia distribution facilities. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Excluding $3.3 million of merger related expenses in 2000, selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to 25.7% compared to 24.7% in 2000. This increase is primarily the result of increases in payroll related costs, including insurance; certain store operating expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and charges recorded in connection with our closed distribution facilities in Philadelphia. The increases in payroll related costs, store operating expenses and depreciation and amortization were primarily due to loss of leverage. 14 Operating Income. Due to the reasons discussed above, excluding $4.4 million of merger related items in 2000, operating income decreased to $203.9 million in 2001 from $207.4 million in 2000 and decreased as a percentage of net sales to 10.3% from 12.3%. Interest Income and Expense. Interest income decreased $0.7 million in 2001 compared to 2000. The decrease resulted primarily from decreased interest rates throughout 2001. Interest expense decreased $2.4 million in 2001 compared to 2000. This decrease was primarily due to the repayment of a revolving credit facility and term loan in May 2000. We benefited slightly from the decrease in variable interest rates in 2001 because of our variable rate operating leases and variable rate debt. However, this benefit was partially offset as a result of the interest rate swaps in effect during 2001. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate decreased to 38.5% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 38.8% for the year ended December 31, 2000 because 2000 included certain non deductible merger related expenses related to Dollar Express. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our business requires capital to open new stores, expand our distribution network and operate existing stores. Our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in September and October. Historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and expansion programs from internally generated funds and seasonal borrowings under our credit facilities. The following table compares cash related information for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000: Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities..................................... $ 206.9 $ 178.7 $ 107.3 Investing activities..................................... (173.8) (121.5) (94.8) Financing activities..................................... 22.5 (1.8) (12.9) The $28.2 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2002 was due primarily to net income before depreciation expense. This increase was offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes due primarily to the timing of payments. Cash used in investing activities is generally expended to open new stores. The $52.3 million increase in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to the following: o Our increased profitability in 2002 provided us with additional cash, which we invested in short term securities. o We increased the number of new stores opened and the average size of those stores in 2002. We also increased the size of our expanded stores. o We invested in technology to improve our supply chain processes. The $24.3 million increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2002 compared with 2001 was primarily the result of the following: o We received $20.7 million more cash pursuant to stock based compensation plans in 2002 compared to 2001 because of an increase in the amount of stock option exercises, which we believe resulted from the increased stock price in the first half of 2002. o We paid $3.8 million in 2001 to repurchase shares in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Emergency Relief Order, which has since expired. We did not repurchase any common stock in 2002. o We made a $6.0 million principal payment on the senior notes in 2002 and 2001. In 2000, we made net repayments of approximately $34.2 million due to repayment of Dollar Express term loan and revolving credit facility and the first principal payment on the senior notes. At December 31, 2002, our long term borrowings were $31.0 million and our capital lease commitments were $28.0 million. We had $50.0 million available through a revolving credit facility. We also have $125.0 million available under the Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, of which approximately $73.0 million was committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise. 15 We adopted the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" early, effective January 1, 2003. As a result, we consolidated the variable interest entity used to finance the construction of four of our distribution centers. Our long term borrowings, including debt related to the variable interest entity, at February 1, 2003 were $171.6 million. Funding Requirements Overview We plan to increase our selling square footage by approximately 22% in fiscal 2003. In 2002, the average investment per new store, including capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre opening costs, was approximately $351,000. We expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2003 to total approximately $156.3 million, which includes approximately $112.7 million for capital expenditures and $43.6 million for initial inventory and pre opening costs. Our total planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2003 are approximately $275.5 million, including planned expenditures for new and expanded stores, new and relocated distribution centers and investments in technology. We believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures, except for the new and relocated distribution centers, for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. We believe that we will be able to obtain adequate funding to construct our new distribution centers. The following tables summarize our material contractual obligations, including both on and off balance sheet arrangements, and our commitments (in millions) at December 31, 2002: Contractual Obligations Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Lease Financing Operating lease obligations $648.3 $149.8 $138.8 $117.3 $87.8 $58.6 $96.0 (excluding distribution center operating lease facility) Capital lease obligations 28.0 7.6 6.5 8.0 5.9 (primarily sale leaseback) Variable interest entity (long term debt as of February 140.6 140.6 1, 2003) Long term Borrowings Long term debt(including 31.0 25.0 6.0 current portion) Total obligations $847.9 $182.4 $151.3 $125.3 $234.3 $58.6 $96.0 Expiring Expiring Expiring Expiring Expiring Commitments Total in 2003 in 2004 in 2005 in 2006 in 2007 Thereafter Unsecured revolving credit $ $ $ $ $ $ $ facility Letters of credit and surety 133.6 133.6 bonds Freight contracts 35.0 24.9 8.2 1.9 Total commitments $168.6 $158.5 $ 8.2 $ 1.9 $ $ $ Lease Financing Operating Lease Obligations. Our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases. The commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to December 31, 2002 for stores that were not yet open on December 31, 2002. Capital Lease Obligations (primarily sale leaseback). In September 1999, we sold certain retail store leasehold improvements to an unrelated third party and leased them back for seven years. We have an option to repurchase the leasehold improvements in September 2004 and September 2006 at amounts approximating their fair market values at the time the option is exercised. The transaction is treated as a financing arrangement for financial accounting purposes. The total amount of the lease obligation is $23.4 million. We are required to make monthly lease payments 16 of $438,000 in the first five years and $638,000 in the sixth and seventh years. As a result of the transaction, we received net cash of $20.9 million and an $8.1 million 11.0% note receivable, which matures in September 2006. The amount of the lease obligation will equal the amount outstanding under the note receivable in September 2006. Variable Interest Entity. In March 2001, we entered into an operating lease known as a synthetic lease to finance the construction of several of our distribution centers. At December 31, 2002, approximately $154.5 million of the $165.0 million facility was committed to the Stockton, Savannah, Briar Creek and Marietta facilities. Because we accounted for this transaction as an operating lease prior to January 1, 2003, the related fixed assets and lease liabilities were not included in our balance sheets and payments under the lease were included in rent expense. In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 46. After evaluating this new standard, our Board of Directors and management determined that we would maintain the existing terms of the facility and include the variable interest entity in our consolidated financial statements effective January 1, 2003. As a result of the implementation, the distribution center assets, the financing related costs and the debt incurred by the variable interest entity to purchase and construct the assets are included on our balance sheets for periods after January 1, 2003. Interest is payable monthly and the principal amount is payable upon maturity of the debt in March 2006. The debt, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and limits certain types of debt we can incur. Estimated payments under this facility at February 1, 2003 are included in the table above. As a result of consolidating the entity, we expect our non cash annual costs to increase $8.6 million ($5.3 million, net of tax). We also expect our return on assets ratio to decrease because of the consolidation of the variable interest entity. For more information on the variable interest entity, see Footnote 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Long Term Borrowings Revenue Bond Financing. In May 1998, we entered into an agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation under which it issued $19.0 million of variable rate demand revenue bonds. We borrowed the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition, construction and installation of land, buildings, machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi. At December 31, 2002, the balance outstanding on the bonds was $19.0 million. We begin repayment of the principal amount of the bonds in June 2006, with a portion maturing each June 1 until the final portion matures in June 2018. The bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable. The bonds contain a demand provision and, therefore, outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities. We pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate, which was 1.5% at December 31, 2002. The bonds are secured by a $19.3 million letter of credit issued by one of our existing lending banks. The letter of credit is renewable annually. The letter of credit and reimbursement agreement require that we maintain specified financial ratios and it restricts our ability to pay cash dividends. Debt Securities. In April 1997, we issued $30.0 million of 7.29% unsecured senior notes, proceeds from which indirectly financed a portion of our Chesapeake distribution center and corporate headquarters. We pay interest on the notes semiannually on April 30 and October 30 each year and we pay principal in five equal annual installments of $6.0 million, which began April 30, 2000. The note holders have the right to require us to prepay the notes in full without premium upon a change of control or upon specified asset dispositions or other transactions we may make. The note agreements prohibit specified mergers and consolidations in which our company is not the surviving company, require that we maintain specified financial ratios, require that the notes rank on par with other debt and limit the amount of debt we can incur. In the event of default or a prepayment at our option, we must pay a penalty to the note holder. Commitments Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. Effective March 12, 2001, we entered into a revolving credit facility with our banks, which provides for a $50.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for working capital bearing interest at the agent banks prime rate or LIBOR plus a spread, at our option. The credit agreement, among other things, requires the maintenance of specified ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and limits certain types of debt we can incur. The facility was originally scheduled to terminate on March 11, 2002; however, we have extended it to May 30, 2003 and expect to extend it on or prior to its expiration. Letters of Credit. Effective March 12, 2001, we entered into a Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, which provides $125.0 million for letters of credit, which are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise. Approximately $73.0 million was committed to letters of credit at December 31, 2002. The facility expires on May 30, 2003; however, we expect it to be extended. We also have letters of credit or surety bonds outstanding for our revenue bond financing, our high deductible insurance program and utility 17 payments at our stores. In addition, we have issued a guarantee for $20.0 million that is used by one of our suppliers as collateral. The guarantee is secured by letters of credit totaling $20.0 million that expire in 2003. Freight Contracts. We have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through August 2003. The total amount of these commitments is approximately $35.0 million. Derivative Financial Instruments We are party to four interest rate swaps, which allow us to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds and a portion of our variable rate variable interest entity debt. The swaps are based on notional amounts of $19.0 million, $10.0 million, $5.0 million and $25.0 million. Under the $19.0 million, $10.0 million and $5.0 million agreements, as amended, we pay interest to the banks that provided the swaps at a fixed rate. In exchange, the financial institution pays us at variable interest rates, which are similar to the rates on the demand revenue bonds and our variable rate operating leases. The variable interest rates on the interest rate swaps are set monthly. No payments are made by either party under the swaps for monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than a predetermined rate (the knock out rate). The swaps may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates. The $25.0 million interest rate swap agreement is used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our variable interest entity debt. Under this agreement, we pay interest to a financial institution at a fixed rate of 5.43%. In exchange, the financial institution pays us at a variable interest rate, which approximates the floating rate on the debt, excluding the credit spread. The interest rate on the swap is subject to adjustment monthly. The swap is effective through March 2006, but it may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates. Because of the knock out provision in the $19.0 million, $10.0 million and $5.0 million interest rate swaps, changes in the fair value of those swaps are recorded in earnings. Changes in fair value on our $25.0 million interest rate swap are recorded as a component of "accumulated other comprehensive income" in the consolidated balance sheets because the swap qualifies for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138. The amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the related interest affects earnings. For more information on the interest rate swaps, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk" on page 21. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. Certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates. Following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical. Inventory Valuation As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted average basis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. The retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis. Inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments, including estimates of merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. The averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period. We estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or carryover seasonal merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of markdowns compared with actual results. Our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. The majority of our counts are taken between January and May of each year; 18 therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at December 31, 2002 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2002, including the fourth quarter. We have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates in our Dollar Tree stores. However, we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition, as was experienced in the former Dollar Express distribution facilities and stores in 2001. We periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent. Our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market. Accrued Expenses On a monthly basis, we estimate certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred. Our most material estimates relate to domestic freight, insurance related expenses, certain store level operating expenses, such as property taxes and utilities, and other expenses. Our freight and store level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical results. Our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuation methods performed by third party actuaries. These actuarial valuations are estimates based on historical loss development factors. Other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them. The related accruals are adjusted as managements estimates change. Differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual. Our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low. Historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Income Taxes On a monthly basis, we estimate our required tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Our taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates, including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently. Management assesses the realizability of our deferred tax asset based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and managements projections for future taxable income. We cannot guarantee that we will generate income in future years. Historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual. Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales, comparable store net sales, operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue. Our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including: o shifts in the timing of certain holidays, especially Easter; o the timing of new store openings; o the net sales contributed by new stores; o changes in our merchandise mix; and o competition. Our highest sales periods are the Christmas and Easter seasons. Easter was observed on March 31, 2002 and will be observed on April 20, 2003. In addition, there were six fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2002 as compared to 2001. The decrease in the selling season resulted from the shift of Thanksgiving from November 22, 2001 to November 28, 2002. We generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter. In anticipation of increased sales activity during these months, we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our permanent store staff. Our operating results, particularly operating and net income, could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the Easter season for any reason, including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems. Our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in Footnote 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Inflation and Other Economic Factors Our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control. The outbreak of war or other national or international events, including terrorism, could lead to disruptions in the economy that could result in decreased consumer spending and increases in costs that are critical to our operations, including inflation in shipping rates, wage rates and other operating costs. 19 Shipping Costs. In the past, we have experienced annual increases of as much as 33% in our trans Pacific shipping rates due primarily to rate increases imposed by the trans Pacific shipping cartel. Currently, trans Pacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers. As a result, our trans Pacific shipping rates may increase when we renegotiate our import shipping rates effective May 2003. During 2000, we experienced a $1.2 million increase in our domestic freight costs because of increased domestic fuel costs. During 2001, we experienced a $0.4 million increase in freight costs compared to 2000 resulting from increased domestic fuel costs. Because of rising fuel costs in 2003, we expect to experience larger increases in freight costs than in past years. Minimum Wage. Although our average hourly wage rate is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage, an increase in the mandated minimum wage could significantly increase our payroll costs. In February 2000, the U.S. Senate approved a proposal increasing the federal minimum wage by $1.00 per hour over three years. In March 2000, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a proposal increasing the federal minimum wage by $1.00 per hour over two years. No bill was passed into law and the status of this issue in the 2003 Congress is uncertain. If the federal minimum wage were to increase by $1.00 per hour, we believe that our annual payroll expenses would increase by approximately 1.0% to 1.5% of operating expenses unless we realize offsetting cost reductions. Leases for Replaced Distribution Centers. We are liable for rent and pass through costs under two leases for now closed distribution centers whose leases expire at various dates through June 2008. Annual rent and pass through costs on these facilities are approximately $1.5 million in fiscal 2003 and 2004, $1.2 million in fiscal 2005, $0.6 million in fiscal 2006 and 2007 and $0.3 million in fiscal 2008. Certain of these distribution facilities have been subleased under agreements expiring at various dates through June 2008. We have recorded charges for these future obligations for certain of the facilities considering current market conditions and probable sublease income at each location. Unless offsetting cost savings are realized, adverse economic factors, including inflation in operating costs, could harm our financial condition and results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and or normal use of the asset. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Our management does not believe the implementation of this standard will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," which addresses the financial accounting and reporting of costs associated with an exit activity (including restructuring) or with a disposal of long lived assets. The standard requires an entity to record a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value, and to subsequently adjust the recorded liability for changes in estimated cash flows. SFAS No. 146 is effective prospectively after December 31, 2002. Our management does not believe the implementation of this standard will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of SFAS No. 123." This statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements. Certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and are included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. FASB Interpretation No. 45 In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an Interpretation of SFAS Nos. 5, 57 and 107 and a recission of FASB Interpretation No. 34." FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued. FIN 45 also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken. The initial recognition and 20 measurement provisions are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements. The disclosure requirements are effective for periods ending after December 15, 2002 and are included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. FASB Interpretation No. 46 In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." Under the terms of this standard, certain variable interest entities, such as the entity that holds our distribution center lease facility, are required to be consolidated. We implemented this standard effective January 1, 2003 and, as a result, the distribution center assets and the $140.6 million of debt incurred by the variable interest entity to purchase and construct the assets are included in balance sheets for periods after January 1, 2003. EITF Issue 02 16 The FASBs EITF Issue 02 16, "Accounting By A Customer (Including A Reseller) For Cash Consideration Received From A Vendor," addresses the accounting treatment for vendor allowances. We have only insignificant allowance agreements with our vendors; therefore, we do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Potential Future Accounting Pronouncements During fiscal 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board is expected to address accounting for stock based compensation. Changes to the existing rules could require companies to recognize compensation expense for stock option grants. If new rules are enacted, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency rate fluctuations. We may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes, and we may employ other risk management strategies, including the use of foreign currency forward contracts. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, consisting of debt and lease obligations issued at variable and fixed rates. Based on amounts outstanding on our fixed rate debt obligations at December 31, 2002, we do not consider our exposure to interest rate risk to be material. We use variable rate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements. These obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, interest expense increases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, interest expense also decreases. We believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments. To meet this objective, we entered into derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variable interest rates on the obligations. The interest rate swaps reduce the interest rate exposure on these variable rate obligations. Under the interest rate swap, we pay the bank at a fixed rate and receive variable interest at a rate approximating the variable rate on the obligation, thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed rate obligation. Under the $19.0 million, $10.0 million and $5.0 million interest rate swaps, no payments are made by parties under the swaps for monthly periods in which the variable interest rate is greater than the predetermined knock out rate. The following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap agreements and the fair value of each interest rate swap at December 31, 2002: Hedging Receive Pay Knock out Expiration Fair Instrument Variable Fixed Rate Value $19.0 million LIBOR 4.88% 7.75% 4/1/09 ($2.1 million) interest rate swap $10.0 million LIBOR 6.45% 7.41% 6/2/04 ($0.7 million) interest rate swap $5.0 million LIBOR 5.83% 7.41% 6/2/04 ($0.3 million) interest rate swap $25.0 million LIBOR 5.43% N/A 3/12/06 ($2.4 million) interest rate swap 21 Hypothetically, a 1% change in interest rates results in approximately a $0.6 million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements on an annual basis. Due to many factors, management is not able to predict the changes in fair value of our interest rate swaps. The fair values are the estimated amounts we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements as of the reporting date. These fair values are obtained from an outside financial institution. Foreign Currency Risk Although we purchase most of our imported goods with U.S. dollars, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to payments to suppliers in Euros (formerly Italian lire). When favorable exchange rates exist, we may hedge foreign currency commitments of future payments by purchasing foreign currency forward contracts. On December 31, 2002, we had no contracts outstanding. Less than 1% of our purchases are contracted in Euros, and the market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rate fluctuations is not material. 22
