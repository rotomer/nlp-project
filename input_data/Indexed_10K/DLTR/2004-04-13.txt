Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company, including: o what factors affect our business; o what our earnings and costs were in 2003 and 2002; o why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; o how all of this affects our overall financial condition; o what our expenditures for capital projects were in 2003 and what we expect them to be in 2004; and o where funds will come from to pay for future expenditures. As you read Managements Discussion and Analysis, please refer to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, which present the results of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004, the one month period ended February 1, 2003, and the calendar years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2003 compared to the comparable fiscal year 2002, the one month period ended February 1, 2003 compared to the one month period ended January 31, 2002 and the calendar year 2002 compared to calendar year 2001. Key Events and Recent Developments Several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations. You should keep in mind that: o In March 2004, we entered into a five year $450.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. We used availability under this facility to repay the $142.6 million of variable rate debt related to our variable interest entity. This facility also replaced the $150.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. o In January 2004, we completed construction on our Ridgefield, Washington distribution center, which is a 665,000 square foot facility that can be expanded in the future to accommodate our growth needs. We began shipping merchandise from this distribution center in February 2004. o In June 2003, we completed our acquisition of Greenbacks, Inc., based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Greenbacks operated 100 stores in 10 western states and an expandable 252,000 square foot distribution center in Salt Lake City. We accounted for this acquisition under the purchase method of accounting and as a result, Greenbacks is included in our results since the date of acquisition, June 29, 2003. o In May 2003, we began construction on a new distribution center in Joliet, Illinois. The Joliet distribution center will be a fully automated 1.2 million square foot facility and will replace our existing Chicago distribution center. It is scheduled to open by mid year 2004. o In February 2003, we opened a new 603,000 square foot automated distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma. o In January 2003, we changed our fiscal year from a calendar year to a retail fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Our first fiscal year reported is fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 is the period beginning February 2, 2003 and ending January 31, 2004. 13 Overview Our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions. Second, sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. We refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales, because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared. We include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. The term expanded also includes stores that are relocated. In fiscal 2003, we increased our selling square footage by 27.5%. Of this 3.6 million selling square foot increase, approximately 0.9 million was added by expanding existing stores. In fiscal 2004, we plan to increase our selling square footage by approximately 20%. Most retailers have the ability to increase their merchandise prices or alter the mix of their merchandise to favor higher priced items in order to increase their comparable store net sales. As a fixed price point retailer, we do not have the ability to raise our prices. Generally, our comparable store net sales will increase only if we sell more merchandise. We expect the substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come from square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of existing stores. We expect the average size of new stores opened in fiscal 2004 to be approximately 10,000 selling square feet per store. In fiscal 2004 and beyond, we plan to predominantly open stores that are approximately 10,000 to 15,000 selling square feet. We believe this size range allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand. Larger stores take longer to negotiate, build out and open and generally have lower net sales per square foot than our smaller stores. While our newer, larger stores have lower sales per square foot than older, smaller stores, they generate higher sales and operating income per store and create an improved shopping environment that invites customers to shop longer and buy more. When our larger stores become the majority of our store base, which we expect to occur by the end of 2005, we believe our net sales per square foot will begin to rise. Our plans for fiscal 2004 operations anticipate comparable store net sales increases of slightly positive to 3%, net sales in the $3.2 to $3.3 billion range and earnings increases of at least 14%. We continue to expect annual gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, to be between 36.0% and 36.5%. We also expect to experience pressure on our gross profit margins in future years as we refine our merchandise mix to include a higher proportion of consumable merchandise, which typically carries a lower gross profit margin, open larger stores and continue to absorb higher costs. We must control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses. Increases in these expenses could negatively impact our operating results because we cannot pass on increased expenses to our customers by increasing our merchandise price above the $1.00 price point. We plan to continue to improve operating expenses, other than depreciation, as a percentage of net sales; however, we expect our depreciation expense to increase by more than 20 basis points in 2004 compared to 2003. As a result, we believe that maintaining our operating margin in 2004 will be a challenge. Depreciation expense is expected to increase as a result of our continued investments in opening larger stores and in technology assets, such as point of sale systems, particularly as we convert existing stores to point of sale. As these assets become fully depreciated, we expect a decrease in our depreciation expense, as a percentage of net sales, beginning in 2006. We expect a shift in the seasonality of our earnings in 2004. Compared to 2003, we expect a smaller portion of our total annual earnings to be realized in the first quarter of 2004 while we believe a larger portion will be realized in the fourth quarter of 2004. This shift is primarily due to the nine day shorter Easter selling season and two additional selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2004 compared to 2003. 14 Results of Operations The following table expresses items from our statements of operations, as a percentage of net sales: Year Month Year Month Ended Ended Ended Ended Year ended January 31, February 1, January 31 December 31, 2004 2003 2003 2002 2002 2001 Net sales.................................... 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of sales................................ 63.8 70.9 63.8 69.3 63.6 64.0 Gross profit........................... 36.2 29.1 36.2 30.7 36.4 36.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses.................................. 25.7 34.3 25.7 32.1 25.5 25.7 Operating income (loss)................ 10.5 (5.2) 10.5 (1.4) 10.9 10.3 Interest income.............................. 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.4 0.2 0.2 Interest expense.............................

Amounts for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003 are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on page 28.

(5,285) Net income............................. $ 177,583 $ 145,219 15 Net Sales. Net sales increased 18.7% in 2003 compared to 2002. We attribute this $442.0 million increase in net sales primarily to new and acquired stores in 2003 and 2002 which are not included in our comparable store net sales calculation and to a comparable store net sales increase of 2.9% in 2003. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores. Our comparable store net sales increase was due to our expanded and relocated stores. Net sales in our larger, newer stores, particularly the 10,000 to 15,000 square foot stores, have been stronger than those in our smaller, older stores. The following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store size and count for fiscal years ended January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003. Fiscal years ended January 31, 2004 February 1, 2003 New stores 183 314 Acquired stores (Greenbacks) 100 0 Expanded or relocated stores 124 110 Closed stores (42) (36) Of the 3.6 million selling square foot increase in 2003, approximately 0.9 million selling square feet was added by expanding existing stores. Gross Profit. Gross profit margin was 36.2% in 2003 and 2002. An approximate 20 basis point decrease in markdowns was offset by an approximate 20 basis point increase in occupancy costs. Our improved markdowns are primarily due to better seasonal sell through, use of point of sale data to better manage the buying process and better allocate merchandise across store classes through use of our supply chain systems. Our increase in occupancy costs was primarily attributed to the loss of leverage as a result of two fewer selling days in 2003 compared to 2002 and increased occupancy rates in our smaller stores which generally experience lower comparable store net sales. In addition, during 2003, gross profit margin was affected by approximately $3.8 million of additional non cash depreciation expense in cost of sales associated with the adoption of FASB Interpretation 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. By adopting FIN 46, four of our distribution centers, previously accounted for as operating leases, were consolidated in our financial statements effective January 1, 2003. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, remained unchanged at 25.7% in 2003. Increased depreciation expense of approximately 50 basis points was primarily offset by a decrease of approximately 40 basis points in payroll related and store operating expenses. The increase in depreciation expense was associated with our larger new and expanded stores and the continued installation of our point of sale systems and other technology assets. Continued improvements in store level labor productivity and store supply expenses were the primary drivers to our lower payroll related and store operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales. Operating Income. Due to the reasons discussed above, operating income margin was consistent at 10.5% for 2003 and 2002. Interest Income and Expense. Interest income, as a percentage of net sales, was consistent at 0.1% in 2003 and 2002. Interest expense increased $3.6 million primarily due to the consolidation of our variable interest entity effective January 1, 2003. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 38.5% in 2003 and 2002. 16 Month Ended February 1, 2003 Compared to Month Ended January 31, 2002 The following table is presented to compare statements of operations amounts for the fiscal month ended February 1, 2003 to the fiscal month ended January 31, 2002. Amounts for the fiscal month ended January 31, 2002 are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on page 28. Month ended February 1, January 31, 2003 2002 (in thousands) Net sales..................................... $ 160,789 $ 132,141 Cost of sales................................. 113,980 91,600 Gross profit............................ 46,809 40,541 Selling, general and administrative expenses................................... 55,237 42,436 Operating loss..........................

(5,240) (1,097) Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax benefit.................................... (5,285) Net loss................................ $ (10,525) $ (1,097) Net Sales. Net sales for the month ended February 1, 2003 increased 21.7% compared to the month ended January 31, 2002. This increase was primarily due to increased sales in our new and expanded stores and one additional selling day in the month ended February 1, 2003 compared to the month ended January 31, 2002. These increases were slightly offset by a 5.1% decrease in comparable store net sales. Gross Profit. Gross profit margin decreased 160 basis points in the month ended February 1, 2003 compared to the month ended January 31, 2002, primarily due to a change in our merchandise mix toward lower margin merchandise. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased 2.3% primarily as a result of a 100 basis point increase in payroll related costs and a 40 basis point increase in depreciation costs. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle. The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle represents, net of tax, the effect of consolidation of our variable interest entity in accordance with the implementation of FIN 46 effective January 1, 2003. The variable interest entity holds the assets and related debt of four of our distribution centers. Calendar Year 2002 Compared to Calendar Year 2001 Net Sales. Net sales increased 17.2% in 2002 compared to 2001. We attribute this $341.9 million increase in net sales primarily to our new stores opened in 2002 and 2001 which are not included in our comparable store net sales increase, and to a comparable store net sales increase of 1.0% in 2002. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores. We opened 318 new stores and closed 30 stores during 2002, compared to 276 new stores opened and 30 stores closed in 2001. During 2002, we opened larger stores than originally planned, which required us to shift our store openings to later in the third quarter and shift some store openings into the fourth quarter. We added 28.8% to our selling square footage in 2002 compared to 29.6% in 2001. Of the 2.9 million in selling square footage increase in 2002, approximately 0.5 million selling square feet was added by expanding 111 existing stores. 17 Gross Profit. Gross profit margin increased to 36.4% in 2002 compared to 36.0% in 2001. This increase in gross profit margin in 2002 was primarily due to a 50 basis point improvement in inventory shrink. This improvement is primarily attributed to lower shrink in our Dollar Express stores and our Philadelphia distribution network and adjustments to our distribution center shrink in connection with our supply chain management system implementation. In addition, merchandise costs increased 50 basis points, but this increase was offset by a 50 basis point improvement in freight costs. The increase in our merchandise costs resulted from a change in our merchandise mix toward lower margin merchandise as we increased the sales of these items in our newer, larger stores. Negotiation of favorable import and domestic freight rates coupled with better management of routing of our merchandise shipments during 2002 compared to 2001 led to the improvements in our freight costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to 25.5% compared to 25.7% in 2001. This decrease is primarily the result of savings achieved from our implementation of various expense management initiatives, particularly with regard to payroll related expenses, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense. Our payroll related expenses decreased 60 basis points in 2002 compared to 2001, while our depreciation and amortization increased 30 basis points for the same period. The increase in depreciation expense resulted primarily from increased depreciation costs associated with our square footage growth and increased depreciation costs resulting from the continued rollout of our point of sale systems. In addition, effective January 1, 2002, we ceased amortization of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We recorded approximately $2.0 million of goodwill amortization in 2001. Operating Income. Due to the reasons discussed above, operating income increased to $253.9 million in 2002 from $203.9 million in 2001 and increased as a percentage of net sales to 10.9% from 10.3%. Interest Income and Expense. Interest income in 2002 was consistent with 2001. Decreased interest rates throughout 2002 were offset by increased levels of cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense decreased $0.9 million in 2002 compared to 2001 due to repayments of our long term debt and a decrease in interest on our capitalized leases. We benefited slightly from the decrease in variable interest rates in 2002; however, this benefit was partially offset as a result of the interest rate swaps in effect during 2002. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 38.5% in 2002 and 2001. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our business requires capital to open new stores, expand our distribution network and operate existing stores. Our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in September and October. Historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and expansion programs from internally generated funds and seasonal borrowings under our credit facilities. The following table compares cash related information for the years ended January 31, 2004, December 31, 2002 and 2001: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, January 31, 2004 2002 2001 (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities............... $ 234.3 $ 206.9 $ 178.7 Investing activities............... (267.4) (173.8) (121.5) Financing activities............... (35.5) 22.5 (1.8) The $27.4 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2003 was due primarily to increased profitability before non cash depreciation and amortization expense. Non cash depreciation expense was primarily attributed to our square footage growth in 2003 and our continued installation of our point of sale systems and other technology assets. These increases were partially offset by the timing and volume of domestic merchandise receipts in January 2004 compared to December 2002. Our outstanding payable days were approximately 30 days in both periods. Cash used in investing activities is generally expended to open new stores and to expand or relocate existing stores. The $93.6 million increase in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to the following: o we acquired Greenbacks for approximately $100 million; o we internally financed the construction of our distribution centers in 2003; and 18 o we increased the number of point of sale installations as well as invested in additional technology assets. These increases were partially offset by $63.5 million in proceeds from net sales of our short term investments. The $58.0 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2003 compared with calendar year 2002 was primarily the result of the following: o We paid approximately $38.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 to repurchase shares under a $200 million authorization granted by our Board of Directors in November 2002. o We received $10.3 million less cash pursuant to stock based compensation plans in 2003 compared to 2002 because of a decrease in the amount of stock option exercises, which we believe resulted from the decreased stock price in 2003 compared to 2002. At January 31, 2004, our long term borrowings were $167.6 million and our capital lease commitments were $20.3 million. We had $150.0 million available through a revolving credit facility. We also have a $125.0 million Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, under which approximately $67.0 million was committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise. In March 2004, we entered into a five year $450.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. This facility bears interest at LIBOR, plus 0.475% spread. We used availability under this facility to repay $142.6 million of variable rate debt related to our variable interest entity and to invest in certain money market securities. As of April 1, 2004, we had $200.0 million available under this facility. This facility replaced the $150.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Funding Requirements Overview In 2003, the average investment per new store, including capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre opening costs, was approximately $442,000. We expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2004 to total approximately $178.0 million, which includes approximately $129.5 million for capital expenditures and $48.5 million for initial inventory and pre opening costs. Our total planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2004 are approximately $199.0 million, including planned expenditures for new and expanded stores, new and relocated distribution centers and investments in technology. We believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and borrowings under our existing credit facilities, including the new facility entered into in March 2004. We believe that we will be able to obtain adequate funding to construct our new distribution centers. The following tables summarize our material contractual obligations, including both on and off balance sheet arrangements, and our commitments (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Lease Financing Operating lease obligations $801.0 $186.9 $169.7 $138.7 $107.1 $71.5 $127.1 Capital lease obligations 20.3 6.8 8.0 5.3 0.1 0.1 (primarily sale leaseback) Long term Borrowings Variable interest entity 142.6 142.6 Long term debt(including 25.0 25.0 current portion) Total obligations $988.9 $218.7 $177.7 $286.6 $107.2 $71.6 $127.1 19 Expiring Expiring Expiring Expiring Expiring Commitments Total in 2004 in 2005 in 2006 in 2007 in 2008 Thereafter Unsecured revolving credit $ $ $ $ $ $ $ facility Letters of credit and bonds 114.6 114.6 Freight contracts 29.7 3.7 7.2 18.8 Technology assets 24.1 24.1 Total commitments $168.4 $142.4 $7.2 $ 18.8 $ $ $ Lease Financing Operating Lease Obligations. Amounts presented are as of December 31, 2003 for leases signed prior to that date. In addition, amounts presented have been updated for new leases entered into during the month of January 2004. Our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases. The commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to January 31, 2004 for stores that were not yet open on January 31, 2004. Capital Lease Obligations (primarily sale leaseback). In September 1999, we sold certain retail store leasehold improvements to an unrelated third party and leased them back for seven years. We have an option to repurchase the leasehold improvements in September 2004 and September 2006 at amounts approximating their fair market values at the time the option is exercised. The transaction is treated as a financing arrangement for financial accounting purposes. The total amount of the lease obligation is $23.4 million. We are required to make monthly lease payments of $438,000 in the first five years and $638,000 in the sixth and seventh years. As a result of the transaction, we received net cash of $20.9 million and an $8.1 million 11.0% note receivable, which matures in September 2006. The amount of the repurchase option under the lease will equal the amount outstanding under the note receivable in September 2006. Long Term Borrowings Variable Interest Entity. In March 2001, we entered into an operating lease, known as a synthetic lease, to finance the construction of several of our distribution centers. At December 31, 2002, approximately $154.5 million of the $165.0 million facility was committed to the Stockton, Savannah, Briar Creek and Marietta facilities. Because we accounted for this transaction as an operating lease prior to January 1, 2003, the related fixed assets and lease liabilities were not included in our balance sheets and payments under the lease were included in rent expense prior to this date. In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 46. After evaluating this new standard, our Board of Directors and management determined that we would maintain the existing terms of the facility and include the variable interest entity in our consolidated financial statements effective January 1, 2003. As a result of the implementation, the distribution center assets, the financing related costs and the debt incurred by the variable interest entity to purchase and construct the assets are included on our balance sheets for periods after January 1, 2003. Interest is payable monthly and the principal amount is payable upon maturity of the debt in March 2006. The debt, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness. In March 2004, we repaid this debt with borrowings from the $450.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. For more information on the variable interest entity, see Notes 6 and 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Revenue Bond Financing. In May 1998, we entered into an agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation under which it issued $19.0 million of variable rate demand revenue bonds. We borrowed the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition, construction and installation of land, buildings, machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi. At January 31, 2004, the balance outstanding on the bonds was $19.0 million. We begin repayment of the principal amount of the bonds in June 2006, with a portion maturing each June 1 until the final portion matures in June 2018. The bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable. The bonds contain a demand provision and, therefore, outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities. We pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate, which was 1.12% at January 31, 2004. The bonds are secured by a $19.3 million letter of credit issued by one of our existing lending banks. The letter of credit is renewable annually. The letter of credit and reimbursement agreement requires that we maintain specified financial ratios and restricts our ability to pay cash dividends. Debt Securities. In April 1997, we issued $30.0 million of 7.29% unsecured senior notes, proceeds from which indirectly financed a portion of our Chesapeake distribution center and corporate headquarters. We pay interest on the notes semiannually on April 30 and October 30 each 20 year and we have been paying principal in equal annual installments of $6.0 million since April 30, 2000. We will make the final payment on April 30, 2004. The note holders have the right to require us to prepay the notes in full without premium upon a change of control or upon specified asset dispositions or other transactions we may make. The note agreements prohibit specified mergers and consolidations in which our company is not the surviving company, require that we maintain specified financial ratios, require that the notes rank on par with other debt and limit the amount of debt we can incur. In the event of default or a prepayment at our option, we must pay a penalty to the note holder. Commitments Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. Effective May 30, 2003, we entered into a $150.0 million revolving credit facility. This facility bears interest at LIBOR, plus a spread. The revolving credit facility, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness. There was no amount outstanding on this facility at January 31, 2004. See a discussion of our new $450.0 million credit facility entered into in March 2004 in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" on page 18. Letters of Credit and Bonds. Effective March 12, 2001, we entered into a Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, which provides $125.0 million for letters of credit, which are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise. Approximately $67.0 million was committed to letters of credit at January 31, 2004. We also have letters of credit or surety bonds outstanding for our revenue bond financing, our high deductible insurance program and utility payments at our stores. Freight Contracts. We have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through January 2007. The total amount of these commitments is approximately $29.7 million. Technology Assets. We have commitments totaling approximately $24.1 million to purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2004. Derivative Financial Instruments We are party to four interest rate swaps, which allow us to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds and a portion of our variable rate, variable interest entity debt. The swaps are based on notional amounts of $19.0 million, $10.0 million, $5.0 million and $25.0 million. Under the $19.0 million, $10.0 million and $5.0 million agreements, as amended, we pay interest to the banks that provided the swaps at a fixed rate. In exchange, the financial institution pays us at variable interest rates, which are similar to the rates on the demand revenue bonds and our variable rate operating leases. The variable interest rates on the interest rate swaps are set monthly. No payments are made by either party under the swaps for monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than a predetermined rate (the knock out rate). The swaps may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates. The $25.0 million interest rate swap agreement is used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our variable interest entity debt. Under this agreement, we pay interest to a financial institution at a fixed rate of 5.43%. In exchange, the financial institution pays us at a variable interest rate, which approximates the floating rate on the debt, excluding the credit spread. The interest rate on the swap is subject to adjustment monthly. The swap is effective through March 2006, but it may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates. Because of the knock out provision in the $19.0 million, $10.0 million and $5.0 million interest rate swaps, changes in the fair value of those swaps are recorded in earnings. Changes in fair value on our $25.0 million interest rate swap are recorded as a component of "accumulated other comprehensive income" in the consolidated balance sheets because the swap qualifies for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138. The amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the related interest affects earnings. In March 2004, we repaid the variable interest entity debt with borrowings from our $450.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. The $25.0 million, $10.0 million and $5.0 million interest rate swaps designated to the variable interest rate debt were redesignated to our borrowings under the $450.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. This redesignation does not effect the accounting method used for the individual interest rate swaps. For more information on the interest rate swaps, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk" on page 24. 21 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. Certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates. Following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical. Inventory Valuation As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted average basis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. The retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis. Inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments, including estimates of merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. The averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period. We estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or carryover seasonal merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of markdowns compared with actual results. Our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. The majority of our counts are taken between January and May of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at January 31, 2004 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2003, including the fourth quarter. We have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates in our Dollar Tree stores. However, we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition, as was experienced in the former Dollar Express distribution facilities and stores in 2001. We periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent. Our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market. Accrued Expenses On a monthly basis, we estimate certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred. Our most material estimates relate to domestic freight, insurance related expenses, certain store level operating expenses, such as property taxes and utilities, and other expenses. Our freight and store level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical results. Our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuation methods performed by third party actuaries. These actuarial valuations are estimates based on historical loss development factors. Other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them. The related accruals are adjusted as managements estimates change. Differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual. Our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low. Historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, we estimate our required tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Our taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates, including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently. Management assesses the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and managements projections for future taxable income. We cannot guarantee that we will generate income in future years. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual. Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales, comparable store net sales, operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue. Our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including: 22 o shifts in the timing of certain holidays, especially Easter; o the timing of new store openings; o the net sales contributed by new stores; o changes in our merchandise mix; and o competition. Our highest sales periods are the Christmas and Easter seasons. Easter was observed on March 31, 2002, April 20, 2003 and will be observed on April 11, 2004. We generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter. In anticipation of increased sales activity during these months, we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our permanent store staff. Our operating results, particularly operating and net income, could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the Easter season for any reason, including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems. Our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in Footnote 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Inflation and Other Economic Factors Our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control. National or international events, including war or terrorism, could lead to disruptions in economies in the United States or in foreign countries where we purchase much of our merchandise. These and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations, such as shipping and wage rates. Consumer spending could also decline because of economic pressures. Shipping Costs. In the past, we have experienced annual increases of as much as 33% in our trans Pacific shipping rates due primarily to rate increases imposed by the trans Pacific shipping cartel. Currently, trans Pacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs. As a result, our trans Pacific shipping costs in fiscal 2004 may increase by $5.0 million or more compared with fiscal 2003 when we renegotiate our import shipping rates effective May 2004. We can give no assurances as to the amount of the increase, as we are in the early stages of our negotiations. Because of rising fuel costs in 2004, we could experience increases in mileage costs as charged by our domestic contract carriers compared with past years. However, we do not expect these increases, if any, to have a material effect on our results of operations, in part, because the opening of two new distribution centers in 2004 is expected to reduce the average distance between our distribution centers and the stores that they service. Minimum Wage. Although our average hourly wage rate is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage, an increase in the mandated minimum wage could significantly increase our payroll costs. In prior years, proposals increasing the federal minimum wage by $1.00 per hour have narrowly failed to pass both houses of Congress. However, if the federal minimum wage were to increase by $1.00 per hour, we believe that our annual payroll expenses would increase by approximately 40 basis points, unless we realize offsetting cost reductions. Leases for Replaced Distribution Centers. We are liable for rent and pass through costs under a lease for a now closed distribution center whose lease expires in September 2005. We have recorded charges for these future obligations considering current market conditions and probable sublease income and do not anticipate recording additional charges under this lease. The lease on our Chicago distribution center expires in June 2005. We are making an effort to find a tenant to sublease the facility when we vacate it later this year to move to our new facility in Joliet; however, if we are unable to locate a suitable tenant, we would have to record a charge for our future obligations under this lease of approximately $1.0 million. Unless offsetting cost savings are realized, adverse economic factors, including inflation in operating costs, could harm our financial condition and results of operations. Potential Future Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an exposure draft addressing the accounting for stock based compensation. A final standard is expected by the end of 2004. Proposed changes to the existing rules require companies to recognize compensation expense for stock option grants. When the new rules are enacted, we expect our results of operations to be materially adversely affected; however, our cash flow and the underlying economics of our financial condition are not expected to be materially affected. We will continue to monitor the development of the new standard and review our stock based compensation plans accordingly. 23 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency rate fluctuations. We may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes, and we may employ other risk management strategies, including the use of foreign currency forward contracts. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, consisting of debt and lease obligations issued at variable and fixed rates. Based on amounts outstanding on our fixed rate debt obligations at January 31, 2004, we do not consider our exposure to interest rate risk to be material. We use variable rate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements. These obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, interest expense increases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, interest expense also decreases. We believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments. To meet this objective, we entered into derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variable interest rates on the obligations. The interest rate swaps reduce the interest rate exposure on these variable rate obligations. Under the interest rate swap, we pay the bank at a fixed rate and receive variable interest at a rate approximating the variable rate on the obligation, thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed rate obligation. Under the $19.0 million, $10.0 million and $5.0 million interest rate swaps, no payments are made by parties under the swaps for monthly periods in which the variable interest rate is greater than the predetermined knock out rate. The following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap agreements and the fair value of each interest rate swap at January 31, 2004: Hedging Receive Pay Knock out Fair Instrument Variable Fixed Rate Expiration Value $19.0 million LIBOR 4.88% 7.75% 4/1/09 ($1.7 million) interest rate swap $10.0 million LIBOR 6.45% 7.41% 6/2/04 ($0.2 million) interest rate swap $5.0 million LIBOR 5.83% 7.41% 6/2/04 ($0.1 million) interest rate swap $25.0 million LIBOR 5.43% N/A 3/12/06 ($1.8 million) interest rate swap Hypothetically, a 1% change in interest rates results in approximately a $0.6 million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements on an annual basis. Due to many factors, management is not able to predict the changes in fair value of our interest rate swaps. The fair values are the estimated amounts we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements as of the reporting date. These fair values are obtained from an outside financial institution. 24
