Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company, including: what factors affect our business; what our earnings and costs were in 2004 and 2003; why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; how all of this affects our overall financial condition; what our expenditures for capital projects were in 2004 and what we expect them to be in 2005; and where funds will come from to pay for future expenditures. As you read Managements Discussion and Analysis, please refer to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, the one month period ended February 1, 2003, and the calendar year ended December 31, 2002. In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2004 compared to the comparable fiscal year 2003 and the fiscal year 2003 compared to the fiscal year 2002. Key Events and Recent Developments Several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations. You should keep in mind that: In March 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of our common stock during the next three years. This authorization superceded the previous repurchase program authorized by the Board in November 2002. In 2004, we completed construction and began operations in two new distribution centers. In June 2004, we began operations in our new distribution center in Joliet, Illinois. The Joliet distribution center is a 1.2 million square foot, fully automated facility that replaced our Chicago distribution center. In February 2004, we began operations in our Ridgefield, Washington distribution center. The Ridgefield distribution center is a 665,000 square foot facility that can be expanded to accommodate future growth needs. With the completion of these two distribution centers, we now have nine distribution centers that will support approximately $4.5 billion in sales annually. We do not plan to expand our distribution center capacity until at least fiscal 2006. In March 2004, we entered into a five year $450.0 million Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (Facility). We used availability under this Facility to repay the $142.6 million of variable rate debt related to our variable interest entity. This Facility also replaced our $150.0 million revolving credit facility. In June 2003, we completed our acquisition of Greenbacks, Inc., based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Greenbacks operated 100 stores in 10 western states and an expandable 252,000 square foot distribution center in Salt Lake City. We accounted for this acquisition under the purchase method of accounting and as a result, Greenbacks is included in our results since the date of acquisition, which was June 29, 2003. In January 2003, we changed our fiscal year from a calendar year to a retail fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Our first fiscal year reported is fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 is the period beginning February 2, 2003 and ending January 31, 2004. 13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Overview Our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions. Second, sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. We refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales, because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared. We include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. The term expanded also includes stores that are relocated. In fiscal 2004, we increased our selling square footage by approximately 21%. Of this 3.6 million selling square foot increase, approximately 0.9 million was added by expanding existing stores. While we met our square footage growth target in 2004, many of these stores opened later than planned during the year, resulting in lower overall sales than planned. Our net comparable store net sales increase for fiscal 2004 was 0.5%, which was lower than planned. If not for the positive effect of relocated stores, our comparable store net sales results would have been negative. In 2005, we will focus on reengineering our real estate process, which includes timely opening of new stores and relocated stores and have therefore planned for square footage growth of 14% 16%. Most retailers have the ability to increase their merchandise prices or alter the mix of their merchandise to favor higher priced items in order to increase their comparable store net sales. As a fixed price point retailer, we do not have the ability to raise our prices. Generally, our comparable store net sales will increase only if we sell more units per transaction or experience an increase in transactions. We expect the substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come from square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of existing stores. We expect the average size of new stores opened in fiscal 2005 to be approximately 10,000 selling square feet per store (or about 12,500 gross square feet). We believe this size allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand. Larger stores take longer to negotiate, build out and open and generally have lower net sales per square foot than our smaller stores. While our newer, larger stores have lower sales per square foot than older, smaller stores, they generate higher sales and operating income per store and create an improved shopping environment that invites customers to shop longer and buy more. When our larger stores become the majority of our store base, which we expect to occur by the end of 2005, we believe our net sales per square foot will begin to rise. We must control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses. Increases in these expenses could negatively impact our operating results because we cannot pass on increased expenses to our customers by increasing our merchandise selling price above the $1.00 price point. Our point of sale technology provides us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and to improve merchandise allocation to the stores. We believe that it will enable us to better control our inventory, which will result in more efficient distribution and store operations. During the first half of fiscal 2004, we completed the rollout of our point of sale systems to most of our stores. Due to the fact that this rollout is now substantially complete, we expect our depreciation expense as a percentage of sales to be about flat for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. Our plans for fiscal 2005 operations anticipate comparable store net sales increases of flat to slightly positive, net sales in the $3.4 to $3.5 billion range and diluted earnings per share of $1.77 to $1.87. We also expect a shift in the seasonality of our earnings in 2005. For example, the Easter selling season is 16 days shorter in the current year, impacting the first quarter of 2005, and there is an extra day between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which will impact the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year. 14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We recognized a one time non cash, after tax adjustment of approximately $5.7 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2004 to reflect the cumulative impact of a correction of our accounting practices related to leased properties. Of the aforementioned amount approximately $1.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, relates to the current year. This adjustment was made in light of the views, of the office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission, expressed in a letter of February 7, 2005, to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles to operating lease accounting matters. Consistent with industry practices, in prior periods, we had reported straight line expenses for leases beginning on the earlier of the store opening date or the commencement date of the lease. This had the effect of excluding the pre opening or build out period of our stores (generally 60 days) from the calculation of the period over which we expense rent. In addition, amounts received as tenant allowances or rent abatements were reflected in the balance sheet as a reduction to store leasehold improvement costs instead of being classified as deferred lease credits. The adjustment made to correct these practices does not affect historical or future net cash flows or the timing of payments under related leases. Rather, this change affected the classification of costs on the statement of operations and cash flows by increasing depreciation and decreasing rent expense, which is included as cost of sales. In addition, fixed assets and deferred liabilities increased due to the net cumulative unamortized allowances and abatements. We believe that the new lease accounting practices will have a $0.01 per diluted share effect on 2005 earnings. Results of Operations The following table expresses items from our statements of operations, as a percentage of net sales: Year Ended January 29, 2005 Year Ended January 31, 2004 Year Ended February 1, 2003 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 64.4 % 63.6 % 63.6 % Gross profit 35.6 % 36.4 % 36.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 26.2 % 25.9 % 25.9 % Operating income 9.4 % 10.5 % 10.5 % Interest income 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.1 % Interest expense (0.3 %) (0.3 %) (0.2 %) Income before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 9.2 % 10.3 % 10.4 % Provision for income taxes (3.4 %) (4.0 %) (4.0 %) Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 5.8 % 6.3 % 6.4 % Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax benefit of $3,309 0.0 % 0.0 % (0.2 %) Net income 5.8 % 6.3 % 6.2 % Fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 compared to fiscal year ended January 31, 2004 Net Sales. Net sales increased 11.6% in 2004 compared to 2003. We attribute this $326.1 million increase in net sales primarily to new stores in 2004 and 2003 which are not included in our comparable store net sales calculation and to a slight increase in comparable store net sales of 0.5% in 2004. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores. If not for the positive effect of relocated stores, our comparable store net sales results would have been negative in 2004. Our stores larger than 10,000 square feet continue to produce our best comparable store net sales results. 15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store size and count for fiscal years ended January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004. January 29,2005 January 31,2004 New stores 209 183 Acquired stores 42 100 Expanded or relocated stores 129 124 Closed stores (29 ) (42 ) Of the 3.6 million selling square foot increase in 2004, approximately 0.9 million in selling square feet was added by expanding existing stores. Gross Profit. Gross profit margin decreased to 35.6% in 2004 compared to 36.4% in 2003. The decrease is primarily due to the following: Merchandise cost, including inbound freight, increased approximately 20 basis points, primarily due to increases in inbound freight costs. Inbound freight costs increased due to higher fuel costs and higher import rates. Markdown expense increased approximately 15 basis points due primarily to hurricane related markdowns in the third quarter of 2004, markdowns taken on lower than planned seasonal sell through of Christmas merchandise and a longer after Christmas holiday sale than in the prior year resulting in higher promotional markdowns. Occupancy costs increased approximately 65 basis points due to deleveraging associated with the low comparable store net sales increase and the increase in rent expenses in 2004 due to the lease accounting changes noted in the Overview. Partially offsetting these increases was an approximate 20 basis point decrease in shrink expense due to the overall improvement in the shrink rate in the current year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 26.2% in 2004 compared to 25.9% in 2003. The increase is primarily due to the following: Depreciation expense increased approximately 30 basis points as a result of our larger new and expanded stores and the continued installation of our point of sales systems and other technology assets. Advertising costs increased approximately 15 basis points due to increased electronic media and print advertising in certain markets in the current year. Insurance and benefits expense increased approximately 10 basis points due to increased healthcare and workers compensation expenses in the current year. Partially offsetting these rate increases was an approximate 15 basis point decrease in store payroll costs in the current year due to continued improvements in store level labor productivity. Operating Income. Due to the reasons discussed above, operating income margin decreased to 9.4% in 2004 compared to 10.5% for 2003. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $1.9 million in 2004 as compared to 2003. This increase is due to increased debt in the current year and $0.7 million of deferred financing costs that were charged to interest expense as a result of the refinancing of the $150.0 million credit facility and the repayment of the $142.6 million of variable rate debt in March 2004. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 37.5% in 2004 compared to 38.5% in 2003. The decreased tax rate for 2004 was due primarily to a one time tax benefit of $2.3 million, or 80 basis points, related to the resolution of a tax uncertainty and approximately $0.6 million, or 20 basis points, related to tax exempt interest on our investments. 16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Fiscal year ended January 31, 2004 compared to fiscal year ended February 1, 2003 The following table is presented to compare statements of operations amounts for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004 to the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003. Amounts for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003 are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on page 28. (In thousands) Year Ended January 31, 2004 Year Ended February 1, 2003 Net sales $ 2,799,872 $ 2,357,836 Cost of sales 1,781,459 1,499,594 Gross profit 1,018,413 858,242 Selling, general and administrative expenses 724,816 610,854 Operating income 293,597 247,388 Interest income 2,648 3,445 Interest expense (8,382 ) (4,812 ) Changes in fair value of non hedging interest rate swaps 889 (1,297 ) Income before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 288,752 244,724 Provision for income taxes 111,169 94,220 Income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 177,583 150,504 Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax benefit (5,285 ) Net income $ 177,583 $ 145,219 Net Sales. Net sales increased 18.7% in 2003 compared to 2002. We attribute this $442.0 million increase in net sales primarily to new stores in 2003 and 2002 which are not included in our comparable store net sales calculation and to a comparable store net sales increase of 2.9% in 2003. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores. Our comparable store net sales increase was due to our expanded and relocated stores. Net sales in our larger, newer stores, particularly the stores over 10,000 square feet, have been stronger than those in our smaller, older stores. The following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store size and count for fiscal years ended January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003. Fiscal years ended January 31,2004 February 1,2003 New stores 183 314 Acquired stores 100 Expanded or relocated stores 124 110 Closed stores (42 ) (36 ) Of the 3.6 million selling square foot increase in 2003, approximately 0.9 million selling square feet was added by expanding existing stores. Gross Profit. Gross profit margin was 36.4% in 2003 and 2002. While gross profit margin remained consistent year to year, the changes in the components of gross margin are detailed below: Markdown expense decreased approximately 20 basis points due to better seasonal sell through, use of point of sale data to better manage the buying process and better allocated merchandise across store classes; 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Offsetting the markdown improvement was a 20 basis point increase in occupancy costs. This increase was the result of two fewer selling days in 2003 compared to 2002 and increased occupancy rates in our smaller stores which generally experience lower comparable store net sales; In addition, during 2003, gross profit margin was affected by approximately $3.8 million of additional non cash depreciation expense in cost of sales associated with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. By adopting FIN 46, four of our distribution centers, previously accounted for as operating leases, were consolidated in our financial statements effective January 1, 2003. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, remained unchanged at 25.9% in 2003; the changes in the components of selling, general and administrative expenses are detailed below: Depreciation expense increased approximately 50 basis points due to our larger new and expanded stores and the continued installation of our new point of sale systems and other technology assets. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately 40 basis points in payroll related and store operating expenses. Continued improvements in store level labor productivity and store supply expenses were the primary drivers of our lower payroll related and store operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales. Operating Income. Due to the reasons discussed above, operating income margin was consistent at 10.5% for 2003 and 2002. Interest Income and Expense. Interest income, as a percentage of net sales, was consistent at 0.1% in 2003 and 2002. Interest expense increased $3.6 million primarily due to the consolidation of our variable interest entity effective January 1, 2003. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 38.5% in 2003 and 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our business requires capital to build and open new stores, expand our distribution network and operate existing stores. Our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in September and October. Historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and expansion programs from internally generated funds and seasonal borrowings under our credit facilities. The following table compares cash related information for the years ended January 29, 2005 and, January 31, 2004: (in millions) Year Ended January 29, 2005 Year Ended January 31, 2004 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 276.5 $ 243.7 Investing activities (315.4 ) (282.4 ) Financing activities 61.3 (35.5 ) The $32.8 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was primarily due to increased profitability before non cash depreciation and amortization expense. Increased non cash depreciation expense was primarily attributed to our square footage growth in 2004, two new distribution centers in the current year and our continued installation of our point of sale systems and other technology assets. Cash used in investing activities is generally expended to open new stores and to expand or relocate existing stores. The $33.0 million increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to the following: increased investment of cash from borrowings under our Facility in the current year; 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements this increase was partially offset by the acquisition of Greenbacks for approximately $100.5 million in 2003; and decreased capital expenditures due to higher expenditures in the prior year on our distribution center projects that were completed in the first half of 2004. The $96.8 million change in cash provided by financing activities in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily the result of the following: increased borrowings under our Facility, net of the repayment of our variable rate debt for our distribution centers; partially offsetting this increase in cash is a $10.6 million increase in stock repurchases in the current year under a $200.0 million authorization granted by our Board of Directors in November 2002 and $7.1 million decrease in cash proceeds from stock issued under stock based compensation plans In March 2004, we entered into a five year $450.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. This facility bears interest at LIBOR, plus 0.475% spread. We used availability under this facility to repay $142.6 million of variable rate debt related to our variable interest entity and to invest in certain short term securities. As of January 29, 2005, we had $200.0 million available under this facility. At January 29, 2005, our long term borrowings were $269.0 million and our capital lease commitments were $12.7 million. We also have a $125.0 million Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, under which approximately $88.9 million was committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise. In March 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of our common stock during the next three years. This new authorization terminated the previous November 2002 authorization. As of the termination date, we had repurchased 5,065,495 shares for approximately $142.0 million under the November 2002 authorization. As of April 13, 2005, we had repurchased 2,048,900 shares for approximately $55.6 million under the March 2005 authorization. 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Funding Requirements Overview In 2004, the average investment per new store, including capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre opening costs, was approximately $469,000. We expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2005 to total approximately $138.6 million, which includes capital expenditures and initial inventory and pre opening costs. Our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 are between $125.0 and $140.0 million, including planned expenditures for new and expanded stores and investments in technology. We believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. The following tables summarize our material contractual obligations, including both on and off balance sheet arrangements, and our commitments (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Lease Financing Operating lease obligations $ 914.9 $ 216.9 $ 188.6 $ 156.3 $ 119.2 $ 83.6 $ 150.3 Capital lease obligations (primarily sale leaseback) 13.7 13.1 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 Long term Borrowings Revolving credit facility 250.0 250.0 Revenue bond financing 19.0 19.0 Total obligations $ 1,197.6 $ 249.0 $ 188.9 $ 156.5 $ 119.3 $ 333.6 $ 150.3 Commitments Total Expiringin 2005 Expiringin 2006 Expiringin 2007 Expiringin 2008 Expiringin 2009 Thereafter Letters of credit and surety bonds $ 129.0 $ 129.0 $ $ $ $ $ Freight contracts 35.5 25.5 10.0 Technology assets 5.8 5.8 Total commitments $ 170.3 $ 160.3 $ 10.0 $ $ $ $ Lease Financing Operating Lease Obligations. Our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases. The commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to January 29, 2005 for stores that were not yet open on January 29, 2005. Capital Lease Obligations (primarily sale leaseback). In September 1999, we sold certain retail store leasehold improvements to an unrelated third party and leased them back for seven years. As a result of the transaction, we received net cash of $20.9 million and an $8.1 million 11.0% note receivable, which matures in October 2005. In 2004, we exercised the right to repurchase the leasehold improvements at October 31, 2005. In order to exercise this right, our lease obligation related to these improvements increased by $0.2 million. The total amount of the lease obligation at January 29, 2005 was $11.7 million. The obligation and the note receivable will both be satisfied at the buyout date of October 31, 2005. Long Term Borrowings Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2004, we entered into a five year Revolving Credit Facility (the Facility). The Facility provides for a $450.0 million line of credit, including up to $50.0 million in available letters of credit, bearing interest at LIBOR, plus 0.475%. The Facility, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness. We used availability under this Facility to repay the $142.6 million of variable rate debt and to purchase short term investments. As of January 29, 2005, we had $250.0 million outstanding on this Facility. 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revenue Bond Financing. In May 1998, we entered into an agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation under which it issued $19.0 million of variable rate demand revenue bonds. We borrowed the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition, construction and installation of land, buildings, machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi. At January 29, 2005, the balance outstanding on the bonds was $19.0 million. We begin repayment of the principal amount of the bonds in June 2006, with a portion maturing each June 1 until the final portion matures in June 2018. The bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable. The bonds contain a demand provision and, therefore, outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities. We pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate, which was 2.57% at January 29, 2005. The bonds are secured by a $19.3 million letter of credit issued by one of our existing lending banks. The letter of credit is renewable annually. The letter of credit and reimbursement agreement requires that we maintain specified financial ratios and restricts our ability to pay cash dividends. Commitments Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds. Effective March 12, 2001, we entered into a Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, which provides $125.0 million for letters of credit, which are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise. Approximately $88.9 million was committed to letters of credit at January 29, 2005. We also have letters of credit or surety bonds outstanding for our revenue bond financing, our insurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores. Freight Contracts. We have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through January 2007. The total amount of these commitments is approximately $35.5 million. Technology Assets. We have commitments totaling approximately $5.8 million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2005. Derivative Financial Instruments We are party to two interest rate swaps, which allow us to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds and a portion of our revolving credit facility. The swaps are based on notional amounts of $19.0 million and $25.0 million. Under the $19.0 million agreement, as amended, we pay interest to the bank that provided the swap at a fixed rate. In exchange, the financial institution pays us at a variable interest rate, which is similar to the rate on the demand revenue bonds. The variable interest rate on the interest rate swap is set monthly. No payments are made by either party under the swap for monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than a predetermined rate (the knock out rate). The swap may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates. The $25.0 million interest rate swap agreement is used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our revolving credit facility. Under this agreement, we pay interest to a financial institution at a fixed rate of 5.43%. In exchange, the financial institution pays us at a variable interest rate, which approximates the floating rate on the debt, excluding the credit spread. The interest rate on the swap is subject to adjustment monthly. The swap is effective through March 2006, but it may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates. Because of the knock out provision in the $19.0 million swap, changes in the fair value of that swap are recorded in earnings. Changes in fair value on our $25.0 million interest rate swap are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets because the swap qualifies for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138. The amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the related interest affects earnings. For more information on the interest rate swaps, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. Certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates. Following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical. Inventory Valuation As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted average basis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. The retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis. Inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments, including estimates of merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. The averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period. We estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or carryover seasonal merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of markdowns compared with actual results. Our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. The majority of our counts are taken between January and May of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at January 29, 2005 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2004, including the fourth quarter. We have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates in our Dollar Tree stores. However, we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition. We periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent. Our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market. Accrued Expenses On a monthly basis, we estimate certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred. Our most material estimates relate to domestic freight, expenses related to our self insurance programs, certain store level operating expenses, such as property taxes and utilities, and other expenses. Our freight and store level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical results. Our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuation methods which are adjusted annually based on a review performed by a third party actuary. These actuarial valuations are estimates based on historical loss development factors. Other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them. The related accruals are adjusted as managements estimates change. Differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual. Our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low. Historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, we estimate our required tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Our taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates, including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently. The current tax liability includes a liability for resolution of tax uncertainties. Management assesses the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements managements projections for future taxable income. We cannot guarantee that we will generate income in future years. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual. However, in 2004 we recognized a one time tax benefit related to the resolution of a tax uncertainty. Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales, comparable store net sales, operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue. Our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including: shifts in the timing of certain holidays, especially Easter; the timing of new store openings; the net sales contributed by new stores; changes in our merchandise mix; and competition. Our highest sales periods are the Christmas and Easter seasons. Easter was observed on April 20, 2003, April 11, 2004 and will be observed on March 27, 2005. Due to the 16 day shorter Easter selling season in 2005, we expect a smaller portion of our annual earnings to be realized in the first quarter of 2005 as compared to 2004. We generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter. In anticipation of increased sales activity during these months, we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff. Our operating results, particularly operating and net income, could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the Easter season for any reason, including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems or consumer sentiment. Our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in Footnote 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Inflation and Other Economic Factors Our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control. Consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures, including rising gas prices. Reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales. National or international events, including war or terrorism, could lead to disruptions in economies in the United States or in foreign countries where we purchase some of our merchandise. These and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations, such as shipping and wage rates. Shipping Costs. In the past, we have experienced annual increases of as much as 33% in our trans Pacific shipping rates due primarily to rate increases imposed by the trans Pacific shipping cartel. Currently, trans Pacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs. We imported 19,612 forty foot equivalent containers in 2004 and expect this number to increase in fiscal 2005 proportionately to sales growth. As a result, our trans Pacific shipping costs in fiscal 2005 may increase compared with fiscal 2004 when we renegotiate our import shipping rates effective May 2005. We can give no assurances as to the amount of the increase, as we are in the early stages of our negotiations. Because of the increase in fuel costs throughout 2004 and the threat of continued increases in 2005, we expect increased fuel surcharges from our domestic contract carriers compared with past years. Based on current fuel prices, we estimate that the costs resulting from increased fuel surcharges may approximate $4.0 to $5.0 million in 2005. We expect to offset a portion of this potential increase with improved operational efficiencies, including improved routing and reduced distance between distribution centers and the stores that they service. Minimum Wage. Although our average hourly wage rate is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage, an increase in the mandated minimum wage could significantly increase our payroll costs. In prior years, proposals increasing the federal minimum wage by $1.00 per hour have narrowly failed to pass both houses of Congress. However, if the federal minimum wage were to 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements increase by $1.00 per hour, we believe that our annual payroll expenses would increase by approximately 40 basis points, unless we realize offsetting cost reductions. Leases for Replaced Distribution Centers. We are liable for rent and pass through costs under two leases for now closed distribution centers whose leases expire in June 2005 and September 2005. We have recorded charges to settle these estimated future obligations. Unless offsetting cost savings are realized, adverse economic factors, including inflation in operating costs, could harm our financial condition and results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). This statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. Under the provisions of this statement, we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption. The transition alternatives include retrospective and prospective adoption methods. Under the retrospective method, prior periods may be restated based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No. 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements) either for all periods presented or as of the beginning of the year of adoption. The prospective method requires that compensation expense be recognized beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements of this statement, for all share based payments granted after the effective date, and based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123, for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of this statement that remain unvested on the effective date. The provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal 2006 and we are currently evaluating the requirements of this revision and have not determined our method of adoption. 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency rate fluctuations. We may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes, and we may employ other risk management strategies, including the use of foreign currency forward contracts. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk We use variable rate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements. These obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, interest expense increases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, interest expense also decreases. We believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments. To meet this objective, we entered into derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variable interest rates on the obligations. The interest rate swaps reduce the interest rate exposure on these variable rate obligations. Under the interest rate swap, we pay the bank at a fixed rate and receive variable interest at a rate approximating the variable rate on the obligation, thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed rate obligation. Under the $19.0 million interest rate swap, no payments are made by parties under the swap for monthly periods in which the variable interest rate is greater than the predetermined knock out rate. The following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap agreements and the fair value of each interest rate swap at January 29, 2005: Hedging Instrument ReceiveVariable Pay Fixed Knock out Rate Expiration Fair Value $19.0 million interest rate swap LIBOR 4.88 % 7.75 % 4/1/09 $ (0.9 million ) $25.0 million interest rate swap LIBOR 5.43 % N/A 3/12/06 $ (0.6 million ) Hypothetically, a 1% change in interest rates results in approximately a $0.4 million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements on an annual basis. Due to many factors, management is not able to predict the changes in fair value of our interest rate swaps. The fair values are the estimated amounts we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements as of the reporting date. These fair values are obtained from an outside financial institution. 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
