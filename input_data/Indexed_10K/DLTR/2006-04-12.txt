Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company, including: what factors affect our business; what our earnings, gross margins and costs were in 2005 and 2004; why those earnings, gross margins and costs were different from the year before; how all of this affects our overall financial condition; what our expenditures for capital projects were in 2005 and what we expect them to be in 2006; and where funds will come from to pay for future expenditures. As you read Managements Discussion and Analysis, please refer to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004. In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2005 compared to the comparable fiscal year 2004 and the fiscal year 2004 compared to the comparable fiscal year 2003. Key Events and Recent Developments Several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations. You should keep in mind that: In March 2006, we completed our acquisition of 138 Deal$ stores and related assets. We paid approximately $30.5 million for store related assets and $22.2 million for store and distribution center inventory. These amounts are subject to post closing adjustments based on the results of physical inventory counts. On December 15, 2005, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting date of all previously issued, outstanding and unvested options under all current stock option plans, effective as of December 15, 2005. This decision eliminated non cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods following our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Share Based Payment (revised 2004) (FAS 123R), on January 29, 2006. Future compensation expense has been reduced by approximately $14.9 million over a period of four years during which the options would have vested, as a result of the option acceleration program. In March 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of our common stock during the next three years. This authorization superseded the previous repurchase program authorized by the Board in November 2002. As of January 28, 2006, we had $174.9 million remaining under this authorization. In 2004, we completed construction and began operations in two new distribution centers. In June 2004, we began operations in our new distribution center in Joliet, Illinois. The Joliet distribution center is a 1.2 million square foot, fully automated facility that replaced our Chicago distribution center. In February 2004, we began operations in our Ridgefield, Washington distribution center. The Ridgefield distribution center is a 665,000 square foot facility that can be expanded to accommodate future growth needs. With the completion of these two distribution centers, we now have nine distribution centers that will support approximately $4.5 billion in sales annually. We do not plan to expand our distribution center capacity until at least fiscal 2007. In March 2004, we entered into a five year $450.0 million Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (Facility). We used availability under this Facility to repay the $142.6 million of variable rate debt. This Facility also replaced our previous $150.0 million revolving credit facility. In June 2003, we completed our acquisition of Greenbacks, Inc., based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Greenbacks operated 100 stores in 10 western states and an expandable 252,000 square foot distribution center in Salt Lake City. We accounted for this acquisition under the purchase method of accounting and as a result, Greenbacks is included in our results since the date of acquisition, which was June 29, 2003. 17 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Overview Our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions. Second, sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. We refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales, because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared. We include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. The term expanded also includes stores that are relocated. In fiscal 2005, we increased our selling square footage by approximately 13%. Of the 2.6 million selling square foot increase in 2005, approximately 0.5 million was added by expanding existing stores. The increase in selling square footage fell slightly below our planned square footage growth of 14% 16% as we closed more stores than planned in fiscal 2005 and our average new store size was slightly below target. The average size of our stores opened in 2005 was approximately 10,000 selling square feet (or about 12,400 gross square feet). In 2006, we expect to open stores slightly smaller than in 2005. These stores generate higher sales and operating income per store than our smaller stores and we believe that they create an improved shopping environment that invites customers to shop longer and buy more. For fiscal 2005, we experienced a decrease in comparable store net sales of 0.8%. This had a negative effect on sales as we had planned to have comparable store net sales to be flat or slightly positive for 2005. Our comparable store net sales results were positively affected by the addition of 0.5 million selling square feet due to expanded and relocated stores during the year. The decrease in comparable store net sales was the result of a decline of 2.6% in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase of 1.9% in transaction size. We believe comparable store net sales were primarily affected by the impact of higher fuel costs, which leave our customers with less disposable income, causing them to make fewer shopping trips and the shift in the timing of Easter from April 11 in 2004 to March 27 in 2005. Most retailers have the ability to increase their merchandise prices or alter the mix of their merchandise to favor higher priced items in order to increase their comparable store net sales. As a fixed price point retailer, we do not have the ability to raise our prices. Generally, our comparable store net sales will increase only if we sell more units per transaction or experience an increase in the number of transactions. In 2005, we put initiatives in place that we believe are helping to offset some of the effect that higher fuel costs are having on our sales, including increased advertising of featured products and continued expansion of forms of payment accepted by our stores. Currently, over 2,300 of our stores accept debit cards, including over 1,400 stores which began accepting debit cards beginning with the roll out in May 2005. We began to see positive effects from these initiatives in the second half of 2005 and believe that they will help increase comparable store net sales, despite continued high fuel costs. We experienced a slight shift in the mix of merchandise sold to more consumables, which have lower margin, in 2005. We believe that higher fuel costs in 2005, which left our customers with less disposable income, contributed to the shift to more consumables as our customers bought more consumable and everyday items as opposed to our other merchandise categories. The shift in mix to more consumables is also the result of the roll out of freezers and coolers to approximately 200 stores in 2005. As we continue to roll out freezers and coolers to approximately 250 more stores in 2006, we expect to continue to see the pressure on margins in 2006. However, we believe that this will enable us to increase sales and earnings in the future by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers. We expect the substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come from square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of existing stores. We expect the average size of new stores opened in fiscal 2006 to be approximately 9,200 selling square feet per store (or about 11,400 gross square feet). We believe this size allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand. Larger stores take longer to negotiate, build out and open and generally have lower net sales per square foot than our smaller stores. While our newer, larger stores have lower sales per square foot than older, smaller stores, they generate higher sales and operating income dollars per store and create an improved shopping environment that invites customers to shop longer and buy more. We must control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses. Increases in these expenses could negatively impact our operating results because we cannot pass on increased expenses to our customers by increasing our merchandise selling price above the $1.00 price point in our Dollar Tree stores. 18 During the first half of fiscal 2004, we completed the rollout of our point of sale systems to most of our stores. Our point of sale technology provides us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and to improve merchandise allocation to the stores. We believe that it has enabled us to better control our inventory, which has resulted in more efficient distribution and store operations. Using the data from this system to better plan our inventory purchases has helped us reduce inventory per store by almost 12% as of January 28, 2006 and increase inventory turnover in the current year. Our plans for fiscal 2006 anticipate comparable store net sales increases of about flat to slightly positive yielding net sales in the $3.845 to $3.940 billion range and diluted earnings per share of $1.68 to $1.80. We also expect a shift in the seasonality of our earnings in 2006. Easter is 20 days later in the current year, positively impacting the first quarter of 2006, and there is an extra shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which will impact the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year. Also, the retail calendar provides us with one extra week of sales in fiscal 2006. This guidance for 2006 is based on 12% 14% selling square footage growth, which includes the acquisition of 138 Deal$ stores, or about 5% of the overall increase (See Deal$ discussion below). On March 26, 2006, we completed our acquisition of 138 Deal$ stores for approximately $30.5 million of store related assets and $22.2 million of store and distribution center related inventory. These amounts are subject to post closing adjustments based on the results of physical inventory counts. These stores are primarily in the Midwest part of the United States and we have existing logistics capacity to service these stores with no additional capital expenditure required. This acquisition also includes a few combo stores that offer an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than $1. Substantially all Deal$ stores acquired will continue to operate under the Deal$ banner while providing us an opportunity to leverage our Dollar Tree infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts, including higher price points without disrupting the single price point model in our Dollar Tree stores. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recognized a one time non cash, after tax adjustment of approximately $5.7 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, to reflect the cumulative impact of a correction of our accounting practices related to leased properties. Of the aforementioned amount, approximately $1.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, related to 2004. This adjustment was made in light of the views of the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission, expressed in a letter of February 7, 2005, to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles to operating lease accounting matters. Consistent with the then current industry practices, we had reported straight line expenses for leases beginning on the earlier of the store opening date or the commencement date of the lease in prior periods. This had the effect of excluding the pre opening or build out period of our stores (generally 60 days) from the calculation of the period over which we expense rent. In addition, amounts received as tenant allowances or rent abatements were reflected in the balance sheet as a reduction to store leasehold improvement costs instead of being classified as deferred lease credits. The adjustment made to correct these practices does not affect historical or future net cash flows or the timing of payments under related leases. Rather, this change affected the classification of costs on the consolidated statement of operations and cash flows by increasing depreciation and decreasing rent expense, which is included as cost of sales. In addition, fixed assets and deferred liabilities increased due to the net cumulative unamortized allowances and abatements. These new lease accounting practices had an approximate $0.02 per diluted share negative effect on 2005 earnings. 19 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Results of Operations The following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations, as a percentage of net sales: Year Ended Year Ended Year Ended January 28, January 29, January 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 65.5 % 64.4 % 63.6 % Gross profit 34.5 % 35.6 % 36.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 26.2 % 26.2 % 25.9 % Operating income 8.3 % 9.4 % 10.5 % Interest income 0.2 % 0.1 % 0.1 % Interest expense (0.4 %) (0.3 %) (0.3 %) Income before income taxes 8.1 % 9.2 % 10.3 % Provision for income taxes (3.0 %) (3.4 %) (4.0 %) Net income 5.1 % 5.8 % 6.3 % Fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 compared to fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 Net Sales. Net sales increased 8.6% in 2005 compared to 2004. We attribute this $267.9 million increase in net sales primarily to new stores in 2005 and 2004 (which are not included in our comparable store net sales calculation) partially offset by a slight decrease in comparable store net sales of 0.8% in 2005. Our comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores. Our stores larger than 10,000 gross square feet continue to produce our best comparable store net sales results. The following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005. January 28, 2006 January 29, 2005 New stores 197 209 Acquired leases 35 42 Expanded or relocated stores 93 129 Closed stores (53 ) (29 ) Of the 2.6 million selling square foot increase in 2005, approximately 0.5 million in selling square feet was added by expanding existing stores. Gross Profit. Gross profit margin decreased to 34.5% in 2005 compared to 35.6% in 2004. The decrease is primarily due to the following: Merchandise cost, including inbound freight, increased approximately 55 basis points, due to a slight shift in mix to more consumables, which have a lower margin and increased inbound freight costs due to higher fuel costs. Occupancy costs increased approximately 45 basis points due primarily to deleveraging associated with the negative comparable store net sales for the year. 20 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 26.2% for 2005 and 2004. However, several components had increases or decreases as noted below: Operating and corporate expenses decreased approximately 25 basis points primarily due to decreased store supplies expense as a result of better pricing, decreased professional fees and the receipt of insurance proceeds resulting from a fire at one of our locations, partially offset by increased interchange fees resulting from the rollout of our debit card program in 2005. Payroll related costs decreased approximately 10 basis points due to a reduction in incentive compensation accruals that are based on 2005 earnings and lower workers compensation and health care claims in the current year. These decreases were partially offset by an approximate 25 basis point increase in store operating costs primarily due to higher utility costs due to higher rates and consumption in the current year. Depreciation expense for stores also increased 10 basis points primarily due to the deleveraging associated with negative comparable store net sales for the current year. Operating Income. Due to the reasons discussed above, operating income margin decreased to 8.3% in 2005 compared to 9.4% for 2004. Interest Income. Interest income increased $2.2 million in 2005 compared to 2004 because of higher investment balances in the current year and increased interest rates. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $4.8 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. This increase is primarily due to increased rates on our revolver in the current year. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 36.8% in 2005 compared to 37.5% in 2004. The decreased tax rate for 2005 was due primarily to the resolution of tax uncertainties in the current year and increased tax exempt interest on certain of our investments. Fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 compared to fiscal year ended January 31, 2004 Net Sales. Net sales increased 11.6% in 2004 compared to 2003. We attribute this $326.1 million increase in net sales primarily to new stores in 2004 and 2003 which are not included in our comparable store net sales calculation and to a slight increase in comparable store net sales of 0.5% in 2004. Our comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores. If not for the positive effect of relocated stores, our comparable store net sales results would have been negative in 2004. The following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004. January 29, 2005 January 31, 2004 New stores 209 183 Acquired stores 100 Acquired leases 42 Expanded or relocated stores 129 124 Closed stores (29 ) (42 ) Of the 3.6 million selling square foot increase in 2004, approximately 0.9 million in selling square feet was added by expanding existing stores. 21 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Gross Profit. Gross profit margin decreased to 35.6% in 2004 compared to 36.4% in 2003. The decrease is primarily due to the following: Merchandise cost, including inbound freight, increased approximately 20 basis points, primarily due to increases in inbound freight costs. Inbound freight costs increased due to higher fuel costs and higher import rates. Markdown expense increased approximately 15 basis points due primarily to hurricane related markdowns in the third quarter of 2004. Also, markdowns taken on lower than planned seasonal sell through of Christmas merchandise and a longer post Christmas holiday sale than in 2003 resulted in higher promotional markdowns. Occupancy costs increased approximately 65 basis points due to deleveraging associated with the low comparable store net sales increase and the increase in rent expense in 2004 due to lease accounting changes noted in the Overview. Partially offsetting these increases was an approximate 20 basis point decrease in shrink expense due to the overall improvement in the shrink rate in 2004. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 26.2% in 2004 compared to 25.9% in 2003. The increase is primarily due to the following: Depreciation expense increased approximately 30 basis points as a result of our larger new and expanded stores and the continued installation of our point of sales systems and other technology assets. Advertising costs increased approximately 15 basis points due to increased electronic media and print advertising in certain markets in 2004. Insurance and benefits expense increased approximately 10 basis points due to increased health care and workers compensation expenses in 2004. Partially offsetting these rate increases was an approximate 15 basis point decrease in store payroll costs in 2004 due to continued improvements in store level labor productivity. Operating Income. Due to the reasons discussed above, operating income margin decreased to 9.4% in 2004 compared to 10.5% for 2003. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $1.9 million in 2004 as compared to 2003. This increase is due to increased debt in the current year and $0.7 million of deferred financing costs that were charged to interest expense as a result of the refinancing of the $150.0 million credit facility and the repayment of the $142.6 million of variable rate debt in March 2004. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 37.5% in 2004 compared to 38.5% in 2003. The decreased tax rate for 2004 was due primarily to a tax benefit of $2.3 million, or 80 basis points, related to the resolution of a tax uncertainty and approximately $0.6 million, or 20 basis points, related to tax exempt interest on our investments. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our business requires capital to build and open new stores, expand our distribution network and operate existing stores. Our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in September and October. Historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities. The following table compares cash related information for the years ended January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005, and January 31, 2004: Year Ended Year Ended Year Ended January 28, January 29, January 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 365.1 $ 276.5 $ 243.7 Investing activities (235.5 ) (315.4 ) (282.4 ) Financing activities (170.3 ) 61.3 (35.5 ) 22 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements The $88.6 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was primarily due to an approximate 12% decrease in inventory per store at January 28, 2006 compared to January 29, 2005. The inventory per store decrease is the result of an initiative to lower backroom inventory levels and increase inventory turns through a reduction in current year purchases. The aforementioned net cash provided was partially offset by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities chiefly as a result of the elimination of bonus depreciation. The $79.9 million decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2005 compared to 2004 was the result of a $34.2 million decrease in net purchases of investments resulting from more cash used to repurchase stock in the current year. The net purchases of investments in the current year include $29.9 million of investments that are in a restricted account to collateralize certain long term insurance obligations. These investments replaced higher cost stand by letters of credit and surety bonds. Capital expenditures also decreased $42.5 million in the current year after two distribution center projects and point of sale installations were completed in 2004. The $231.6 million change in cash used in financing activities in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily resulted from $180.4 million in stock repurchases in the current year compared to $48.6 million in the prior year. Also in the prior year, we entered into a five year $450.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, under which we received proceeds of $250.0 million. We used a portion of these proceeds to repay $142.6 million of variable rate debt for our distribution centers and invested the balance in short term tax exempt municipal bonds. As of January 28, 2006, we had $250.0 million outstanding and $200.0 million available under this facility. This facility bears interest at LIBOR, plus 0.475% spread. The $32.8 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was primarily due to increased profitability before non cash depreciation and amortization expense. Increased non cash depreciation expense was primarily attributed to our square footage growth in 2004, two new distribution centers in 2004 and our continued installation of our point of sale systems and other technology assets. Cash used in investing activities is generally expended to open new stores and to expand or relocate existing stores. The $33.0 million increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to the following: increased investment of cash from borrowings under our Facility in 2004; this increase was partially offset by the acquisition of Greenbacks for approximately $100.5 million in 2003; and decreased capital expenditures due to higher expenditures in 2003 on our distribution center projects that were completed in the first half of 2004 The $96.8 million change in cash provided by financing activities in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily the result of the following: increased borrowings under our Facility, net of the repayment of our variable rate debt for our distribution centers; partially offsetting this increase in cash is a $10.6 million increase in stock repurchases in 2004 under a $200.0 million authorization granted by our Board of Directors in November 2002 and a $7.1 million decrease in cash proceeds from stock issued under stock based compensation plans At January 28, 2006, our long term borrowings were $269.0 million and our capital lease commitments were $0.9 million. We also have a $125.0 million and a $50.0 million Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, under which approximately $81.6 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at January 28, 2006. In March 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of our common stock during the next three years. This authorization terminated the previous November 2002, $200.0 million authorization. For 2005 and 2004, we repurchased 7,024,450 shares and 1,809,953 shares, respectively, for approximately $180.4 million and $48.6 million, respectively. As of January 28, 2006, we have approximately $174.9 million remaining under the March 2005 authorization. From January 29, 2006 through March 31, 2006, we have repurchased additional shares totaling $22.6 million under this authorization. 23 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Funding Requirements Overview In 2005, the average investment per new store, including capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre opening costs, was approximately $508,000. We expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2006 to total approximately $136.0 million, which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre opening costs. Our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 are between $145.0 and $155.0 million, including planned expenditures for our new and expanded Dollar Tree stores, improvements to the acquired Deal$ stores and investments in technology. We believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. The following tables summarize our material contractual obligations, including both on and off balance sheet arrangements, and our commitments (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Lease Financing Operating lease obligations $ 1,015.1 $ 243.2 $ 212.9 $ 174.5 $ 138.5 $ 96.2 $ 149.8 Capital lease obligations 1.1 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.1 Long term Borrowings Revolving credit facility 250.0 250.0 Revenue bond financing 19.0 19.0 Total obligations $ 1,285.2 $ 262.6 $ 213.2 $ 174.7 $ 388.6 $ 96.3 $ 149.8 Commitments Total Expiring in 2006 Expiring in 2007 Expiring in 2008 Expiring in 2009 Expiring in 2010 Thereafter Letters of credit and surety bonds $ 124.7 $ 122.7 $ 2.0 $ $ $ $ Freight contracts 47.2 31.8 13.5 1.9 Technology assets 6.5 6.5 Total commitments $ 178.4 $ 161.0 $ 15.5 $ 1.9 $ $ $ Lease Financing Operating Lease Obligations. Our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases. The commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to January 28, 2006 for stores that were not yet open on January 28, 2006. Capital Lease Obligations. Our capital lease obligations are primarily for payments for distribution center equipment and computer equipment at the store support center. Long Term Borrowings Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2004, we entered into a five year Revolving Credit Facility (the Facility). The Facility provides for a $450.0 million line of credit, including up to $50.0 million in available letters of credit, bearing interest at LIBOR, plus 0.475%. The Facility, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness. We used availability under this Facility to repay the $142.6 million of variable rate debt and to purchase short term investments. As of January 28, 2006, we had $250.0 million outstanding on this Facility. Revenue Bond Financing. In May 1998, we entered into an agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation under which it issued $19.0 million of variable rate demand revenue bonds. We used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition, construction and installation of land, buildings, machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi. At January 28, 2006, the balance outstanding on the bonds was $19.0 million. These bonds are due to be repaid in June 2018. The bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable. The bonds contain a demand provision and, therefore, outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities. We pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate, which was 4.6% at January 28, 2006. 24 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds. In March 2001, we entered into a Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, which provides $125.0 million for letters of credit. In December 2004, we entered into an additional Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, which provides $50.0 million for letters of credit. Both of these letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise. Approximately $81.6 million was committed to letters of credit at January 28, 2006. We also have letters of credit or surety bonds outstanding for our insurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores. Freight Contracts. We have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through April 2008. The total amount of these commitments is approximately $47.2 million. Technology Assets. We have commitments totaling approximately $6.5 million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2006. Derivative Financial Instruments We are party to two interest rate swaps, which allow us to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds and a portion of our revolving credit facility. The swaps are based on notional amounts of $19.0 million and $25.0 million. Under the $19.0 million agreement, as amended, we pay interest to the bank that provided the swap at a fixed rate. In exchange, the financial institution pays us at a variable interest rate, which is similar to the rate on the demand revenue bonds. The variable interest rate on the interest rate swap is set monthly. No payments are made by either party under the swap for monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than a predetermined rate (the knock out rate). The swap may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates and expires in 2009. The $25.0 million interest rate swap agreement is used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our revolving credit facility. Under this agreement, we pay interest to a financial institution at a fixed rate of 5.43%. In exchange, the financial institution pays us at a variable interest rate, which approximates the floating rate on the debt, excluding the credit spread. The interest rate on the swap is subject to adjustment monthly. The swap is effective through March 2006, but it may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates. Because of the knock out provision in the $19.0 million swap, changes in the fair value of that swap are recorded in earnings. Changes in fair value on our $25.0 million interest rate swap are recorded as a component of "accumulated other comprehensive income" in the consolidated balance sheets because the swap qualifies for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138. The amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the related interest affects earnings. For more information on the interest rate swaps, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk." Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. Certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates. Following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical. Inventory Valuation As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted average basis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. The retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis. Inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. The averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period. 25 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements We estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or carryover seasonal merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results. Our accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. Our physical inventory counts are generally taken between January and August of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at January 28, 2006 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2005, including the fourth quarter. We have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates in our Dollar Tree stores for the last two years. However, we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition. We periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent. Our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market on a year to year and consistent basis. Accrued Expenses On a monthly basis, we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred. Our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses, self insurance programs, store level operating expenses, such as property taxes and utilities, and certain other expenses. Our freight and store level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical results. Our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted annually based on a review performed by a third party actuary. These actuarial valuations are estimates based on historical loss development factors. Certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them. The related accruals are adjusted as managements estimates change. Differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual. Our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low. Historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates, including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently. The current tax liability includes a liability for resolution of tax uncertainties. Management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and managements projections for future taxable income. We cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual. However, in 2005 and 2004, we recognized approximately $1.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively, of tax benefits related to the resolution of tax uncertainties. 26 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales, comparable store net sales, operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue. Our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including: shifts in the timing of certain holidays, especially Easter; the timing of new store openings; the net sales contributed by new stores; changes in our merchandise mix; and competition. Our highest sales periods are the Christmas and Easter seasons. Easter was observed on April 11, 2004, March 27, 2005 and will be observed on April 16, 2006. Due to the 20 day longer Easter selling season in 2006, we expect a larger portion of our annual earnings to be realized in the first quarter of 2006 as compared to 2005. We generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter. In anticipation of increased sales activity during these months, we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff. Our operating results, particularly operating and net income, could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the Easter season for any reason, including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems or consumer sentiment. Our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in Footnote 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Inflation and Other Economic Factors Our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control. Consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures, including rising fuel prices. Reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales. National or international events, including war or terrorism, could lead to disruptions in economies in the United States or in foreign countries where we purchase some of our merchandise. These and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations, such as shipping and wage rates. Shipping Costs. In the past, we have experienced annual increases of as much as 33% in our trans Pacific shipping rates due primarily to rate increases imposed by the trans Pacific ocean carriers. Currently, trans Pacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs. We imported 18,838 forty foot equivalent containers in 2005 and expect this number to increase in fiscal 2006 proportionately to sales growth. As a result, our trans Pacific shipping costs in fiscal 2006 may increase compared with fiscal 2005 when we renegotiate our import shipping rates effective May 2006. We can give no assurances as to the amount of the increase, as we are in the early stages of our negotiations. Because of the increase in fuel costs throughout 2005 and the threat of continued increases in 2006, we expect increased fuel surcharges from our domestic contract carriers compared with past years. Based on current fuel prices, we estimate that the costs resulting from increased fuel surcharges may approximate $2.0 to $3.0 million in 2006. We expect to offset a portion of this potential increase with improved operational efficiencies. Minimum Wage. Although our average hourly wage rate is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage, an increase in the mandated minimum wage could significantly increase our payroll costs. In prior years, proposals increasing the federal minimum wage by $1.00 per hour have narrowly failed to pass both houses of Congress. However, if the federal minimum wage were to increase by $1.00 per hour, we believe that our annual payroll expenses would increase by approximately 40 basis points, unless we realize offsetting cost reductions. 27 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements New Accounting Pronouncements Effective January 29, 2006 (the first day of fiscal 2006), the Company adopted FAS 123R. This statement is a revision of FAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. FAS 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. The Company adopted FAS 123R using the modified prospective method, which requires expensing of all share based payments granted on or after January 29, 2006 and for all awards granted to employees that were unvested as of January 29, 2006. On December 15, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the acceleration of the vesting date of all previously issued, outstanding and unvested options under all current stock option plans, including the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2004 Executive Officer Equity Plan, effective as of December 15, 2005. At the effective date, almost all of these options had exercise prices higher than the actual stock price. The Company made the decision to accelerate vesting of these options to give employees increased performance incentives and to enhance current retention. This decision also eliminated non cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods following the Companys adoption of FAS 123R on January 29, 2006. Future compensation expense has been reduced by $14.9 million, over a period of four years during which the options would have vested, as a result of the option acceleration program. This amount is net of compensation expense of $150,000 recognized in fiscal 2005 for estimated forfeiture of certain (in the money) options. In March 2006, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted approximately 317,500 options. The grant date for these options is March 31, 2006. The fair value of these options of approximately $3.5 million will be recognized over the three year vesting period. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency rate fluctuations. We may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes, and we may employ other risk management strategies, including the use of foreign currency forward contracts. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk We use variable rate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements. These obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, interest expense increases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, interest expense also decreases. We believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments. To meet this objective, we entered into derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variable interest rates on the obligations. The interest rate swaps reduce the interest rate exposure on these variable rate obligations. Under the interest rate swap, we pay the bank at a fixed rate and receive variable interest at a rate approximating the variable rate on the obligation, thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed rate obligation. Under the $19.0 million interest rate swap, no payments are made by parties under the swap for monthly periods in which the variable interest rate is greater than the predetermined knock out rate. The following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap agreements and the fair value of each interest rate swap at January 28, 2006: Hedging Instrument Receive Variable Pay Fixed Knock out Rate Expiration Fair Value $19.0 million interest rate swap LIBOR 4.88% 7.75% 4/1/09 ($0.1 million) $25.0 million interest rate swap LIBOR 5.43% N/A 3/12/06 ($0.04 million) 28 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Hypothetically, a 1% change in interest rates results in approximately a $0.4 million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements on an annual basis. Due to many factors, management is not able to predict the changes in fair value of our interest rate swaps. The fair values are the estimated amounts we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements as of the reporting date. These fair values are obtained from an outside financial institution. 29 Table of Contents
