Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company, including: what factors affect our business; what our earnings, gross margins and costs were in 2006 and 2005; why those earnings, gross margins and costs were different from the year before; how all of this affects our overall financial condition; what our expenditures for capital projects were in 2006 and what we expect them to be in 2007; and where funds will come from to pay for future expenditures. As you read Managements Discussion and Analysis, please refer to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005. In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2006 compared to the comparable fiscal year 2005 and the fiscal year 2005 compared to the comparable fiscal year 2004. Key Events and Recent Developments Several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations. You should keep in mind that: In November 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of our common stock. This amount was in addition to the $26.7 million remaining on the $300.0 million March 2005 authorization. As of February 3, 2007, we had approximately $427.0 million remaining under this authorization. In March 2006, we completed our acquisition of 138 Deal$ stores and related assets. We paid approximately $32.0 million for store related assets and $22.1 million for inventory. On December 15, 2005, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting date of all previously issued, outstanding and unvested options under all current stock option plans, effective as of December 15, 2005. This decision eliminated non cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods following our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Share Based Payment (revised 2004) (FAS 123R), on January 29, 2006. Compensation expense has been reduced by approximately $14.9 million over a period of four years during which the options would have vested, as a result of the option acceleration program. In 2004, we completed construction and began operations in two new distribution centers. In June 2004, we began operations in our new distribution center in Joliet, Illinois. The Joliet distribution center is a 1.2 million square foot, fully automated facility. In February 2004, we began operations in our Ridgefield, Washington distribution center. The Ridgefield distribution center is a 665,000 square foot facility that can be expanded to accommodate future growth needs. In 2007, we are planning to expand our Briar Creek distribution center by 400,000 square feet. Upon completion of this expansion, our nine distribution centers will support approximately $5.0 billion in sales annually. In March 2004, we entered into a five year $450.0 million Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (Facility). We used availability under this Facility to repay variable rate debt. This Facility also replaced our previous $150.0 million revolving credit facility. Overview Our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions. Second, sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. We refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales, because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared. We include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. The term expanded also includes stores that are relocated. Table of Contents 18 At February 3, 2007, we operated 3,219 stores in 48 states, with 26.3 million selling square feet compared to 2,914 stores with 23.0 million selling square feet at January 28, 2006. During fiscal 2006, we opened 211 stores, expanded 85 stores and closed 44 stores, compared to 232 new stores opened, 93 stores expanded and 53 stores closed during fiscal 2005. In addition, we acquired 138 Deal$ stores on March 25, 2006. Including the Deal$ acquisition, we achieved the high end of our square footage growth target of 12% 14% for the fiscal year. In fiscal 2006, we increased our selling square footage by approximately 3.3 million square feet, or approximately 14%. Of the 3.3 million selling square foot increase in 2006, approximately 1.2 million resulted from the acquisition of the Deal$ stores and 0.4 million was added by expanding existing stores. The average size of our stores opened in 2006 was approximately 9,000 selling square feet (or about 11,000 gross square feet). The average new store size decreased in 2006 from approximately 10,000 selling square feet (or about 12,400 gross square feet) for new stores in 2005. For 2007, we continue to plan to open stores around 9,000 selling square feet (or about 11,000 gross square feet). We believe that the 11,000 12,500 gross square foot store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives the customer an improved shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more. We expect the substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come from the square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of existing stores. Fiscal 2006 ended on February 3, 2007 and included 53 weeks, commensurate with the retail calendar. The 53rd week in 2006 added approximately $70 million in sales. Fiscal 2005 ended on January 28, 2006 and included 52 weeks. In fiscal 2006, comparable store net sales increased by 4.6%. This increase was based on 53 weeks for both periods. The comparable store net sales increase was the result of increases of 1.9% in the number of transactions and 2.7% in transaction size, compared to fiscal 2005. We believe comparable store net sales were positively affected by the initiatives we began putting in place in 2005, including expansion of forms of payment accepted by our stores and the roll out of freezers and coolers to more of our stores. During 2006, we completed the roll out of debit card acceptance to all of our stores, which has enabled us to accept Electronic Benefit Transfer cards and we now accept food stamps in approximately 600 qualified stores. We believe the expansion of forms of payment accepted by our stores has helped increase the average transaction size in our stores. In 2006, we continued to experience a slight shift in the mix of merchandise sold to more consumables, which we believe increases the traffic in our stores but have lower margin. The planned shift in mix to more consumables is the result of the roll out of freezers and coolers to more stores in 2005 and 2006. At February 3, 2007, we had freezers and coolers in approximately 700 stores, compared to approximately 250 stores at January 28, 2006. We plan to add freezers and coolers to approximately 250 more stores in 2007, which we believe will continue to pressure margins, as a percentage of sales, in 2007. However, we believe that this will enable us to increase sales and earnings in the future by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers. Our point of sale technology is now in all of our stores, and this technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores. We believe that this has enabled us to better control our inventory, resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations and increased inventory turnover. Using the data captured at the point of sale has enabled us to better plan our inventory purchases and helped us reduce our inventory investment per store by approximately 5.0% at February 3, 2007 compared to January 28, 2006. In addition, inventory turnover has increased 70 basis points in 2006 as compared to 2005. We must continue to control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses. Increases in these expenses could negatively impact our operating results. Our plans for fiscal 2007 anticipate comparable store net sales increases of approximately 1% to 3% yielding net sales in the $4.22 billion to $4.33 billion range and diluted earnings per share of $1.96 to $2.10. This guidance for 2007 is predicated on selling square footage growth of approximately 10%. Table of Contents 19 On March 25, 2006, we completed our acquisition of 138 Deal$ stores. These stores are located primarily in the Midwest part of the United States and we have existing logistics capacity to service these stores. This acquisition also included a few combo stores that offer an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than $1. Substantially all Deal$ stores acquired continue to operate under the Deal$ banner while providing us an opportunity to leverage our Dollar Tree infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts, including higher price points, without disrupting the single price point model in our Dollar Tree stores. At February 3, 2007, 121 of these stores were selling items priced at over $1.00. We paid approximately $32.0 million for store related and other assets and $22.1 million for inventory. The results of Deal$ store operations are included in our financial statements since the acquisition date and did not have a significant impact on our operating results through February 3, 2007. This acquisition is immaterial to our operations as a whole and therefore no proforma disclosure of financial information has been presented. Results of Operations The following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations, as a percentage of net sales: Year Ended Year Ended Year Ended February 3, January 28, January 29, 2007 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 65.8 % 65.5 % 64.4 % Gross profit 34.2 % 34.5 % 35.6 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 26.4 % 26.2 % 26.2 % Operating income 7.8 % 8.3 % 9.4 % Interest income 0.2 % 0.2 % 0.1 % Interest expense (0.4 %) (0.4 %) (0.3 %) Income before income taxes 7.6 % 8.1 % 9.2 % Provision for income taxes (2.8 %) (3.0 %) (3.4 %) Net income 4.8 % 5.1 % 5.8 % Fiscal year ended February 3, 2007 compared to fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 Net Sales. Net sales increased 16.9%, or $575.5 million, in 2006 compared to 2005, resulting from sales in our new and expanded stores, including 138 Deal$ stores acquired in March 2006 and the 53 weeks of sales in 2006 versus 52 weeks in 2005, which accounted for approximately $70 million of the increase. Our sales increase was also impacted by a 4.6% increase in comparable store net sales for the year. This increase is based on a 53 week comparison for both periods. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones. The following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006. February 3, 2007 January 28, 2006 New stores 190 197 Deal$ acquisition 138 Acquired leases 21 35 Expanded or relocated stores 85 93 Closed stores (44) (53) Table of Contents 20 Of the 3.3 million selling square foot increase in 2006, approximately 1.2 million resulted from the acquisition of the Deal$ stores and 0.4 million was added by expanding existing stores. Gross Profit. Gross profit margin decreased to 34.2% in 2006 compared to 34.5% in 2005. The decrease was primarily due to a 35 basis point increase in merchandise cost, including inbound freight. This increase in merchandise cost was due to a slight shift in mix to more consumables, which have a lower margin, higher cost merchandise at our Deal$ stores and increased inbound domestic freight costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 26.4% for 2006 as compared to 26.2% for 2005. The increase is primarily due to the following: Payroll and benefit related costs increased 35 basis points due to increased incentive compensation costs resulting from better overall company performance in the current year as compared to the prior year and increased stock compensation expense, partially offset by lower workers compensation costs in the current year. Operating and corporate expenses decreased 10 basis points primarily as the result of payments received for early lease terminations in the current year. Operating Income. Due to the reasons discussed above, operating income margin decreased to 7.8% in 2006 compared to 8.4% in 2005. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 36.6% in 2006 compared to 36.8% in 2005. The decreased tax rate for 2006 was due primarily to increased tax exempt interest on certain of our investments in the current year. Fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 compared to fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 Net Sales. Net sales increased 8.6% in 2005 compared to 2004. We attribute this $267.9 million increase in net sales primarily to new stores in 2005 and 2004 (which are not included in our comparable store net sales calculation) partially offset by a slight decrease in comparable store net sales of 0.8% in 2005. Our comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores. The following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005. January 28, 2006 January 29, 2005 New stores 197 209 Acquired leases 35 42 Expanded or relocated stores 93 129 Closed stores (53) (29) Of the 2.6 million selling square foot increase in 2005, approximately 0.5 million in selling square feet was added by expanding existing stores. Gross Profit. Gross profit margin decreased to 34.5% in 2005 compared to 35.6% in 2004. The decrease is primarily due to the following: Merchandise cost, including inbound freight, increased approximately 55 basis points, due to a slight shift in mix to more consumables, which have a lower margin and increased inbound freight costs due to higher fuel costs. Occupancy costs increased approximately 45 basis points due primarily to deleveraging associated with the negative comparable store net sales for the year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 26.2% for 2005 and 2004. However, several components had increases or decreases as noted below: Operating and corporate expenses decreased approximately 25 basis points primarily due to decreased store supplies expense as a result of better pricing, decreased professional fees and the receipt of insurance proceeds resulting from a fire at one of our locations, partially offset by increased interchange fees resulting from the rollout of debit card acceptance in 2005. Payroll related costs decreased approximately 10 basis points due to a reduction in incentive compensation accruals that are based on lower than budgeted 2005 earnings and lower workers compensation and health care claims in the current year. These decreases were partially offset by an approximate 25 basis point increase in store operating costs primarily due to higher utility costs due to higher rates and consumption in the current year. Depreciation expense for stores also increased 10 basis points primarily due to the deleveraging associated with negative comparable store net sales for the current year. Table of Contents 21 Operating Income. Due to the reasons discussed above, operating income margin decreased to 8.3% in 2005 compared to 9.4% for 2004. Interest Income. Interest income increased $2.2 million in 2005 compared to 2004 because of higher investment balances in the current year and increased interest rates. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $4.8 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. This increase is primarily due to increased rates on our revolver in the current year. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 36.8% in 2005 compared to 37.5% in 2004. The decreased tax rate for 2005 was due primarily to the resolution of tax uncertainties in the current year and increased tax exempt interest on certain of our investments. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our business requires capital to build and open new stores, expand our distribution network and operate existing stores. Our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in September and October. Historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities. The following table compares cash related information for the years ended February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006, and January 29, 2005: Year Ended Year Ended Year Ended February 3, January 28, January 29, (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 412.8 $ 365.1 $ 276.5 Investing activities (190.7 ) (235.5 ) (315.4 ) Financing activities (202.9 ) (170.3 ) 61.2 The $47.7 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was primarily due to increased earnings before depreciation in the current year and better payables management in the current year, partially offset by approximately $20.0 million of rent payments for February 2007 made prior to the end of fiscal 2006. The $44.8 million decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was the result of a $114.9 million increase in net proceeds from short term investments which were used to help fund stock repurchases and the Deal$ acquisition in the current year. In the current year, we purchased an additional $9.3 million of investments in a restricted account to collateralize certain long term insurance obligations. Additional uses of cash for investing activities consisted of $54.1 million for the Deal$ acquisition in the current year and an increase of $36.1 million in capital expenditures due primarily to new store growth and the installation of freezers and coolers to certain stores in the current year. The $32.6 million increase in cash used in financing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily resulted from $248.2 million in stock repurchases in the current year compared to $180.4 million in the prior year. This increase was partially offset by increased proceeds from stock option exercises in the current year resulting from our higher stock prices in 2006 as compared to 2005. The $88.6 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was primarily due to an approximate 12% decrease in inventory per store at January 28, 2006 compared to January 29, 2005. The inventory per store decrease is the result of an initiative to lower backroom inventory levels and increase inventory turns through a reduction in 2005 purchases. The aforementioned net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities chiefly as a result of the elimination of bonus depreciation. Table of Contents 22 The $79.9 million decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2005 compared to 2004 was the result of a $34.2 million decrease in net purchases of investments resulting from more cash used to repurchase stock in the current year. The net purchases of investments in 2005 include $29.9 million of investments that are in a restricted account to collateralize certain long term insurance obligations. These investments replaced higher cost stand by letters of credit and surety bonds. Capital expenditures also decreased $42.5 million in 2005 after two distribution center projects and point of sale installations were completed in 2004. The $231.5 million change in cash used in financing activities in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily resulted from $180.4 million in stock repurchases in 2005 compared to $48.6 million in 2004. Also in 2004, we entered into a five year $450.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, under which we received net proceeds of $248.9 million. We used a portion of these proceeds to repay $142.6 million of variable rate debt for our distribution centers and invested the balance in short term tax exempt municipal bonds. At February 3, 2007, our long term borrowings were $268.8 million and our capital lease commitments were $0.7 million. We also have $125.0 million and $50.0 million Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreements, under which approximately $84.8 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at February 3, 2007. In March 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of our common stock through March 2008. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 5,650,871 shares for approximately $148.2 million under the March 2005 authorization. In November 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of our common stock. This amount was in addition to the $27.0 million remaining on the March 2005 authorization. In December 2006, we entered into two agreements with a third party to repurchase approximately $100.0 million of the Companys common shares under an Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement (ASR). The first $50.0 million was executed in an uncollared agreement. In this transaction, we initially received 1,656,178 shares based on the market price of our stock of $30.19 as of the trade date (December 8, 2006). A weighted average price was calculated using stock prices from December 16, 2006 March 8, 2007. This represents the calculation period and based on the weighted average price during this period, a settlement took place in March 2007 resulting in additional funding of $3.3 million. The remaining $50.0 million relates to a collared agreement in which we initially received 1,500,703 shares representing the minimum number of shares under the agreement. The maximum number of shares that can be repurchased under the agreement is 1,693,101. The number of shares was determined based on the weighted average market price of our common stock during the same calculation period as defined in the uncollared agreement. The weighted average market price as of February 3, 2007 as defined in the collared agreement was $30.80. Therefore, as of February 3, 2007, we would receive an additional 122,742 shares under the collared agreement. Based on the applicable accounting literature, these additional shares were not included in the weighted average diluted earnings per share calculation because their effect would be antidilutive. The weighted average stock price of our common stock as defined in the collared agreement as of March 8, 2007 (termination date) was $31.97. We received an additional 63,325 shares on March 8, 2007 under this agreement. On March 29, 2007, we entered into an agreement with a third party to repurchase approximately $150.0 million of our common shares under another ASR. The entire $150.0 million was executed under a "collared" agreement. Within two weeks of the March 29, 2007 execution date, we will receive the minimum number of shares. Up to four months after the initial execution date, we will receive additional shares from the third party depending on the volume weighted average price of our common shares during that period, subject to the maximum share delivery provisions of the agreement. Table of Contents 23 Funding Requirements Overview We expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2007 to total approximately $160.7 million, which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre opening costs. Our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 are between $170.0 and $190.0 million, including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores, the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 250 stores, an expansion of the Briar Creek Distribution Center and an expansion to our home office and data center in Chesapeake, Va. We believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facilities. The following tables summarize our material contractual obligations, including both on and off balance sheet arrangements, and our commitments, excluding interest on long term borrowings (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Lease Financing Operating lease obligations $ 1,177.0 $ 284.2 $ 246.0 $ 207.2 $ 161.5 $ 110.6 $ 167.5 Capital lease obligations 0.8 0.4 0.3 0.1 Long term Borrowings Revolving credit facility 250.0 250.0 Revenue bond financing 18.8 18.8 Total obligations $ 1,446.6 $ 303.4 $ 246.3 $ 457.3 $ 161.5 $ 110.6 $ 167.5 Commitments Total Expiring in 2007 Expiring in 2008 Expiring in 2009 Expiring in 2010 Expiring in 2011 Thereafter Letters of credit and surety bonds $ 116.3 $ 115.6 $ 0.7 $ $ $ $ Freight contracts 57.1 38.6 9.9 8.6 Technology assets 3.8 3.8 Total commitments $ 177.2 $ 158.0 $ 10.6 $ 8.6 $ $ $ Lease Financing Operating Lease Obligations. Our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases. The commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to February 3, 2007 for stores that were not yet open on February 3, 2007. Capital Lease Obligations. Our capital lease obligations are primarily for payments for distribution center equipment and computer equipment at the store support center. Long Term Borrowings Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2004, we entered into a five year Revolving Credit Facility (the Facility). The Facility provides for a $450.0 million line of credit, including up to $50.0 million in available letters of credit. Interest is assessed under the line based on matrix pricing which currently approximates LIBOR, plus 0.475%. The Facility, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness. We used availability under this Facility to repay the $142.6 million of variable rate debt and to purchase short term investments. As of February 3, 2007, we had $250.0 million outstanding on this Facility. Table of Contents 24 Revenue Bond Financing. In May 1998, we entered into an agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation under which it issued $19.0 million of variable rate demand revenue bonds. We used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition, construction and installation of land, buildings, machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi. At February 3, 2007, the balance outstanding on the bonds was $18.8 million. These bonds are due to be fully repaid in June 2018. The bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable. The bonds contain a demand provision and, therefore, outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities. We pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate, which was 5.4% at February 3, 2007. Commitments Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds. In March 2001, we entered into a Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, which provides $125.0 million for letters of credit. In December 2004, we entered into an additional Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, which provides $50.0 million for letters of credit. Letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately $84.8 million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at February 3, 2007. We also have approximately $31.5 million of letters of credit or surety bonds outstanding for our insurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores. Freight Contracts. We have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through April 2009. The total amount of these commitments is approximately $57.1 million. Technology Assets. We have commitments totaling approximately $3.8 million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2007. Derivative Financial Instruments We are party to one interest rate swap, which allows us to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds. The swap is based on a notional amount of $18.8 million. Under the $18.8 million agreement, as amended, we pay interest to the bank that provided the swap at a fixed rate. In exchange, the financial institution pays us at a variable interest rate, which is similar to the rate on the demand revenue bonds. The variable interest rate on the interest rate swap is set monthly. No payments are made by either party under the swap for monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than a predetermined rate (the knock out rate). The swap may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates and expires in 2009. Because of the knock out provision in the $18.8 million swap, changes in the fair value of that swap are recorded in earnings. For more information on the interest rate swaps, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk." Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. Certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates. Following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical. Inventory Valuation As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted average basis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. The retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis. Inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. The averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period. We estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or seasonal, carryover merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results. Table of Contents 25 Our accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. Our physical inventory counts are generally taken between January and September of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at February 3, 2007 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2006, including the fourth quarter. We have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond 10 to 15 basis points in our Dollar Tree stores for the last two years. However, we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition. We periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent. Our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis. Accrued Expenses On a monthly basis, we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred. Our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses, self insurance programs, store level operating expenses, such as property taxes and utilities, and certain other expenses. Our freight and store level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results. Our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted annually based on a review performed by a third party actuary. These actuarial valuations are estimates based on historical loss development factors. Certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them. The related accruals are adjusted as managements estimates change. Differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual. Our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low. Historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates, including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently. The current tax liability also includes a liability for resolution of tax uncertainties. Management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and managements projections for future taxable income. We cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual. In 2006 and 2005, we recognized approximately $0.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of tax benefits related to the resolution of tax uncertainties in certain states. Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales, comparable store net sales, operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue. Our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including: shifts in the timing of certain holidays, especially Easter; the timing of new store openings; the net sales contributed by new stores; changes in our merchandise mix; and competition. Our highest sales periods are the Christmas and Easter seasons. Easter was observed on March 27, 2005, April 16, 2006 and will be observed on April 8, 2007. We generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter. In anticipation of increased sales activity during these months, we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff. Our operating results, particularly operating and net income, could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the Easter season for any reason, including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems or consumer sentiment. Fiscal 2006 consisted of 53 weeks, commensurate with the retail calendar. This extra week contributed approximately $70.0 million of sales in 2006. Fiscal 2007 will consist of 52 weeks. Table of Contents 26 Our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in Footnote 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Inflation and Other Economic Factors Our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control. Consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures, including rising fuel prices. Reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales. National or international events, including war or terrorism, could lead to disruptions in economies in the United States or in foreign countries where we purchase some of our merchandise. These and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations, such as shipping and wage rates. Shipping Costs. Currently, trans Pacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs. As a result, our trans Pacific shipping costs in fiscal 2007 may increase compared with fiscal 2006 when we renegotiate our import shipping rates effective May 2007. We can give no assurances as to the amount of the increase, as we are in the early stages of our negotiations. Minimum Wage. Although our average hourly wage rate is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage, an increase in the mandated minimum wage could increase our payroll costs. In early 2007, proposals increasing the federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour over a three year period have passed both houses of Congress. If the federal minimum wage were to increase over the next three years to $7.25 per hour, we believe that it would not have a material effect on our annual payroll expenses. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We do not expect that the adoption of FIN 48 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency rate fluctuations. We may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes, and we may employ other risk management strategies, including the use of foreign currency forward contracts. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk We use variable rate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements. These obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, interest expense increases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, interest expense also decreases. We believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments. To meet this objective, we entered into a derivative instrument in the form of an interest rate swap to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variable interest rates on the Demand Revenue Bonds. The interest rate swap reduces the interest rate exposure on this variable rate obligation. Under the interest rate swap, we pay the bank at a fixed rate and receive variable interest at a rate approximating the variable rate on the obligation, thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed rate obligation. Under the swap, no payments are made by parties under the swap for monthly periods in which the variable interest rate is greater than the predetermined knock out rate. Table of Contents 27 The following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap agreement and the fair value of the interest rate swap at February 3, 2007: Hedging Instrument Receive Variable Pay Fixed Knock out Rate Expiration Fair Value $18.8 million interest rate swap LIBOR 4.88% 7.75% 4/1/09 At February 3, 2007, the fair value of this interest rate swap is less than $0.1 million. Hypothetically, a 1% change in interest rates results in approximately a $0.2 million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement on an annual basis. Due to many factors, management is not able to predict the changes in fair value of our interest rate swap. The fair values are the estimated amounts we would pay or receive to terminate the agreement as of the reporting date. These fair values are obtained from an outside financial institution.
