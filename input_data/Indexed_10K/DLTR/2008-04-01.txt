Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company, including: what factors affect our business; what our net sales, earnings, gross margins and costs were in 2007, 2006 and 2005; why those net sales, earnings, gross margins and costs were different from the year before; how all of this affects our overall financial condition; what our expenditures for capital projects were in 2007 and what we expect them to be in 2008; and where funds will come from to pay for future expenditures. As you read Managements Discussion and Analysis, please refer to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006. In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2007 compared to the comparable fiscal year 2006 and the fiscal year 2006 compared to the comparable fiscal year 2005. Key Events and Recent Developments Several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations. You should keep in mind that: On March 2, 2008, we reorganized by creating a new holding company structure. The new parent company is Dollar Tree, Inc., replacing Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., which is now an operating subsidiary. Outstanding shares of the capital stock of Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., were automatically converted, on a share for share basis, into identical shares of common stock of the new holding company. The articles of incorporation, the bylaws, the executive officers and the board of directors of our new holding company are the same as those of the former Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. in effect immediately prior to the reorganization. The common stock of our new holding company will continue to be listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol DLTR. The rights, privileges and interests of our stockholders will remain the same with respect to our new holding company. On February 20, 2008, we entered into a five year $550.0 million Credit Agreement (the Agreement). The Agreement provides for a $300.0 million revolving line of credit, including up to $150.0 million in available letters of credit, and a $250.0 million term loan. The interest rate on the facility will be based, at our option, on a LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. Our March 2004, $450.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility was terminated concurrent with entering into the Agreement. In November 2007, we completed the 400,000 square foot expansion of our Briar Creek distribution center. Including this expansion, we believe that our nine distribution centers will support approximately $6.7 billion in sales annually. In October 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $500.0 million of our common stock. This authorization was in addition to the November 2006 authorization which had approximately $98.4 million remaining. At February 2, 2008, we had approximately $453.7 million remaining under Board authorization. In March 2006, we completed our acquisition of 138 Deal$ stores and related assets. We paid approximately $32.0 million for store related assets and $22.1 million for inventory. On December 15, 2005, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting date of all previously issued, outstanding and unvested options under all current stock option plans, effective as of December 15, 2005. This decision eliminated non cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods following our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Share Based Payment (revised 2004) (FAS 123R), on January 29, 2006. Compensation expense has been reduced by approximately $14.9 million over a period of four years during which the options would have vested, as a result of the option acceleration program. 19 Overview Our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions. Second, sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. We refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales, because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared. We include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. The term expanded also includes stores that are relocated. At February 2, 2008, we operated 3,411 stores in 48 states, with 28.4 million selling square feet compared to 3,219 stores with 26.3 million selling square feet at February 3, 2007. During fiscal 2007, we opened 240 stores, expanded 102 stores and closed 48 stores, compared to 211 new stores opened, 85 stores expanded and 44 stores closed during fiscal 2006. In addition to the new stores opened in 2006, we acquired 138 Deal$ stores on March 25, 2006. In the current year we achieved 8% selling square footage growth. Of the 2.1 million selling square foot increase in 2007, 0.4 million was added by expanding existing stores. The average size of our stores opened in 2007 was approximately 8,500 selling square feet (or about 10,800 gross square feet). The average new store size decreased slightly in 2007 from approximately 9,000 selling square feet (or about 11,000 gross square feet) for new stores in 2006. For 2008, we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8,500 9,000 selling square feet (or about 10,000 12,500 gross square feet). We believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an improved shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more. We expect the substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come from the square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of existing stores. Fiscal 2006 ended on February 3, 2007 and included 53 weeks, commensurate with the retail calendar. The 53rd week in 2006 added approximately $70 million in sales. Fiscal 2007 and 2005 ended on February 2, 2008 and January 28, 2006, respectively, and both years included 52 weeks. In fiscal 2007, comparable store net sales increased by 2.7%. This increase was based on the comparable 52 weeks for both years. We believe comparable store net sales were positively affected by a number of our initiatives over the past year, including expansion of forms of payment accepted by our stores and the roll out of freezers and coolers to more of our stores. During 2006, we completed the roll out of pin capture debit card acceptance to all of our stores, which has enabled us to accept Electronic Benefit Transfer cards and we now accept food stamps in approximately 1,100 qualified stores. We believe the expansion of forms of payment accepted by our stores has helped increase the average transaction size in our stores. On October 31, 2007, all of our stores began accepting VISA credit as well, which we expect to have a positive impact on future sales. We continued to experience a slight shift in the mix of merchandise sold to more consumables which we believe increases the traffic in our stores; however, this merchandise has lower margins. The negative impact from the planned shift toward more consumables was smaller in 2007 than in 2006. The planned shift in mix to more consumables is partially the result of the roll out of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more stores in 2007 and 2006. At February 2, 2008 we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 1,100 stores compared to approximately 700 stores at February 3, 2007. We believe that this will continue to enable us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers and increasing the average transaction size. Our point of sale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores. We believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations and increased inventory turnover for each of the last two years. Inventory turnover improved by approximately 25 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 and by approximately 45 basis points in 2006 compared to 2005. Inventory per store has also remained constant at February 2, 2008 compared to February 3, 2007 despite slightly lower than expected fourth quarter 2007 sales and the increased merchandise flow due to the earlier Easter season in 2008. 20 We must continue to control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses. Increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results. Our plans for fiscal 2008 anticipate net sales in the $4.49 billion to $4.62 billion range and diluted earnings per share of $2.17 to $2.35. This guidance for 2008 is predicated on selling square footage growth of approximately 9%. The earnings per share guidance for 2008 is exclusive of any share repurchase activity in 2008. On March 25, 2006, we completed our acquisition of 138 Deal$ stores. These stores are located primarily in the Midwest part of the United States and we have existing logistics capacity to service these stores. This acquisition also included a few combo stores that offer an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than $1. Substantially all Deal$ stores acquired continue to operate under the Deal$ banner while providing us an opportunity to leverage our Dollar Tree infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts, including higher price points, without disrupting the single price point model in our Dollar Tree stores. At February 2, 2008, 131 of these stores were selling items priced over $1.00, compared to 121 stores at February 3, 2007. We paid approximately $32.0 million for store related and other assets and $22.1 million for inventory. The results of Deal$ store operations are included in our financial statements since the acquisition date and did not have a significant impact on our operating results in fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006. Results of Operations The following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations, as a percentage of net sales: Year Ended Year Ended Year Ended February 2, February 3, January 28, 2008 2007 2006 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 65.6 % 65.8 % 65.5 % Gross profit 34.4 % 34.2 % 34.5 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 26.6 % 26.4 % 26.2 % Operating income 7.8 % 7.8 % 8.3 % Interest income 0.1 % 0.2 % 0.2 % Interest expense (0.4 %) (0.4 %) (0.4 %) Income before income taxes 7.5 % 7.6 % 8.1 % Provision for income taxes (2.8 %) (2.8 %) (3.0 %) Net income 4.7 % 4.8 % 5.1 % Fiscal year ended February 2, 2008 compared to fiscal year ended February 3, 2007 Net Sales. Net sales increased 6.9%, or $273.2 million, in 2007 compared to 2006, resulting primarily from sales in our new and expanded stores. Our sales increase was also impacted by a 2.7% increase in comparable store net sales for the year. This increase is based on the comparable 52 weeks for both years. These increases were partially offset by an extra week of sales in 2006 due to the 53 week retail calendar for 2006. On a comparative 52 week basis, sales increased approximately 8.8% in 2007 compared to 2006. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones. 21 The following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007. February 2, 2008 February 3, 2007 New stores 208 190 Deal$ acquisition 138 Acquired leases 32 21 Expanded or relocated stores 102 85 Closed stores (48) (44) Of the 2.1 million selling square foot increase in 2007 approximately 0.4 million was added by expanding existing stores. Gross Profit. Gross profit margin increased to 34.4% in 2007 compared to 34.2% in 2006. The increase was primarily due to a 50 basis point decrease in merchandise cost, including inbound freight, due to improved initial mark up in many categories in the current year. This decrease was partially offset by a 40 basis point increase in occupancy costs due to the loss of leverage from the extra week of sales in the prior year and the lower comparable store net sales in the current year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 26.6% for 2007 compared to 26.4% for 2006. The increase is primarily due to the following: Operating and corporate expenses increased approximately 25 basis points due to increased debit and credit fees resulting from increased debit transactions in the current year and the rollout of VISA credit at October 31, 2007. Also, in 2006, we had approximately 10 basis points of income related to early lease terminations. Occupancy costs increased 15 basis points primarily due to increased repairs and maintenance costs in the current year. Partially offsetting these increases was an approximate 15 basis point decrease in depreciation expense due to the expiration of the depreciable life on much of the supply chain hardware and software placed in service in 2002. Operating Income. Due to the reasons discussed above, operating income margin was 7.8% in 2007 and 2006. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 37.1% in 2007 compared to 36.6% in 2006. The increase in the rate for 2007 reflects a reduction of tax exempt interest income in the current year due to lower investment levels resulting from increased share repurchase activity and an increase in tax reserves in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. These increases more than offset a slight decrease in our net state tax rate. Fiscal year ended February 3, 2007 compared to fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 Net Sales. Net sales increased 16.9%, or $575.5 million, in 2006 compared to 2005, resulting from sales in our new and expanded stores, including 138 Deal$ stores acquired in March 2006 and the 53 weeks of sales in 2006 versus 52 weeks in 2005, which accounted for approximately $70 million of the increase. Our sales increase was also impacted by a 4.6% increase in comparable store net sales for the year. This increase is based on a 53 week comparison for both periods. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones. The following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006. February 3, 2007 January 28, 2006 New stores 190 197 Deal$ acquisition 138 Acquired leases 21 35 Expanded or relocated stores 85 93 Closed stores (44) (53) 22 Of the 3.3 million selling square foot increase in 2006, approximately 1.2 million resulted from the acquisition of the Deal$ stores and 0.4 million was added by expanding existing stores. Gross Profit. Gross profit margin decreased to 34.2% in 2006 compared to 34.5% in 2005. The decrease was primarily due to a 35 basis point increase in merchandise cost, including inbound freight. This increase in merchandise cost was due to a slight shift in mix to more consumables, which have a lower margin, higher cost merchandise at our Deal$ stores and increased inbound domestic freight costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 26.4% for 2006 as compared to 26.2% for 2005. The increase is primarily due to the following: Payroll and benefit related costs increased 35 basis points due to increased incentive compensation costs resulting from better overall company performance in 2006 as compared to 2005 and increased stock compensation expense, partially offset by lower workers compensation costs in 2006. Operating and corporate expenses decreased 10 basis points primarily as the result of payments received for early lease terminations in 2006. Operating Income. Due to the reasons discussed above, operating income margin decreased to 7.8% in 2006 compared to 8.3% in 2005. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 36.6% in 2006 compared to 36.8% in 2005. The decreased tax rate for 2006 was due primarily to increased tax exempt interest on certain of our investments in 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our business requires capital to build and open new stores, expand our distribution network and operate existing stores. Our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in September and October. Historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities. The following table compares cash related information for the years ended February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007, and January 28, 2006: Year Ended Year Ended Year Ended February 2, February 3, January 28, (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 367.3 $ 412.8 $ 365.1 Investing activities (22.7 ) (190.7 ) (235.5 ) Financing activities (389.0 ) (202.9 ) (170.3 ) Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $45.5 million compared to last year due to increased working capital requirements in the current year and increases in the provision for deferred taxes, partially offset by improved earnings before depreciation and amortization in the current year. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $168.0 million compared to last year. This decrease is due to $129.1 million of increased proceeds from short term investment activity in the current year to fund increased capital stock repurchases and $54.1 million used in the prior year to acquire Deal$ assets. These were partially offset by increased capital expenditures in the current year resulting from the Briar Creek distribution center and the corporate headquarters expansions. Net cash used in financing activities increased $186.1 million due primarily to increased stock repurchases in the current year partially offset by increased proceeds from stock option exercises in the current year resulting from the Companys higher stock price earlier in the year. The $47.7 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily due to increased earnings before depreciation and better payables management in 2006, partially offset by approximately $28.9 million of rent payments for February 2007 made prior to the end of fiscal 2006. 23 The $44.8 million decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was the result of a $114.9 million increase in net proceeds from short term investments which were used to help fund stock repurchases and the Deal$ acquisition in 2006. In 2006, we purchased an additional $9.3 million, net, of investments in a restricted account to collateralize certain long term insurance obligations. Additional uses of cash for investing activities consisted of $54.1 million for the Deal$ acquisition in 2006 and an increase of $36.1 million in capital expenditures due primarily to new store growth and the installation of freezers and coolers to certain stores in 2006. The $32.6 million increase in cash used in financing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily resulted from $248.2 million in stock repurchases in 2006 compared to $180.4 million in 2005. This increase was partially offset by increased proceeds from stock option exercises in 2006 resulting from our higher stock prices in 2006 as compared to 2005. At February 2, 2008, our long term borrowings were $268.5 million and our capital lease commitments were $0.9 million. We also have $125.0 million and $50.0 million Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreements, under which approximately $88.9 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at February 2, 2008. On February 20, 2008, we entered into a five year $550.0 million Credit Agreement (the Agreement). The Agreement provides for a $300.0 million revolving line of credit, including up to $150.0 million in available letters of credit, and a $250.0 million term loan. Our March 2004, $450.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility was terminated concurrent with entering into the Agreement. In March 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of our common stock through March 2008. In November 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of our common stock. This amount was in addition to the $27.0 million remaining on the March 2005 authorization. Then, in October 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $500.0 million of our common stock. This authorization was in addition to the November 2006 authorization which had approximately $98.4 million remaining at the time. In December 2006, we entered into two agreements with a third party to repurchase approximately $100.0 million of our common shares under an Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement. The first $50.0 million was executed in an uncollared agreement. In this transaction we initially received 1.7 million shares based on the market price of our stock of $30.19 as of the trade date (December 8, 2006). A weighted average price of $32.17 was calculated using stock prices from December 16, 2006 March 8, 2007. This represented the calculation period for the weighted average price. Based on this weighted average price, we paid the third party an additional $3.3 million on March 8, 2007 for the 1.7 million shares delivered under this agreement. The remaining $50.0 million was executed under a collared agreement. Under this agreement, we initially received 1.5 million shares through December 15, 2006, representing the minimum number of shares to be received based on a calculation using the cap or high end of the price range of the collar. The number of shares received under the agreement was determined based on the weighted average market price of our common stock, net of a predetermined discount, during the time after the initial execution date through March 8, 2007. The calculated weighted average market price through March 8, 2007, net of a predetermined discount, as defined in the collared agreement, was $31.97. Therefore, on March 8, 2007, we received an additional 0.1 million shares under the collared agreement resulting in 1.6 million total shares being repurchased under this agreement. On March 29, 2007, we entered into an agreement with a third party to repurchase $150.0 million of our common shares under an Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement. The entire $150.0 million was executed under a collared agreement. Under this agreement, we initially received 3.6 million shares through April 12, 2007, representing the minimum number of shares to be received based on a calculation using the cap or high end of the price range of the collar. The number of shares was determined based on the weighted average market price of our common stock during the four months after the initial execution date. The calculated weighted average market price through July 30, 2007, net of a predetermined discount, as defined in the collared agreement, was $40.78. Therefore, on July 30, 2007, we received an additional 0.1 million shares under the collared agreement resulting in 3.7 million total shares being repurchased under this agreement. 24 On August 30, 2007, we entered into an agreement with a third party to repurchase $100.0 million of our common shares under an Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement. The entire $100.0 million was executed under a collared agreement. Under this agreement, we initially received 2.1 million shares through September 10, 2007, representing the minimum number of shares to be received based on a calculation using the cap or high end of the price range of the collar. The number of shares received under the agreement was determined based on the weighted average market price of our common stock, net of a predetermined discount, during the time after the initial execution date through a period of up to four and one half months. The contract terminated on October 22, 2007 and the weighted average price through that date was $41.16. Therefore, on October 22, 2007, we received an additional 0.3 million shares resulting in 2.4 million total shares repurchased under this agreement. We repurchased approximately 12.8 million shares for approximately $473.0 million in fiscal 2007, approximately 8.8 million shares for approximately $248.2 million in fiscal 2006 and approximately 7.0 million shares for approximately 180.4 million in fiscal 2005. At February 2, 2008, the Company had approximately $453.7 remaining under Board authorization. Funding Requirements Overview We expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2008 to total approximately $176.0 million, which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre opening costs. Our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 are between $155.0 and $165.0 million, including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores, the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 150 stores and completion of the expansion to our home office and data center in Chesapeake, Va. We believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facility. The following tables summarize our material contractual obligations at February 2, 2008, including both on and off balance sheet arrangements, and our commitments, excluding interest on long term borrowings (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Lease Financing Operating lease obligations $ 1,363.2 $ 319.0 $ 284.3 $ 238.4 $ 185.8 $ 129.9 $ 205.8 Capital lease obligations 0.9 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.1 Long term Borrowings Revolving credit facility 250.0 250.0 Revenue bond financing 18.5 18.5 Interest on long term borrowings 13.7 11.8 1.9 Total obligations $ 1,646.3 $ 349.6 $ 536.5 $ 238.6 $ 185.9 $ 129.9 $ 205.8 Commitments Total Expiring in 2008 Expiring in 2009 Expiring in 2010 Expiring in 2011 Expiring in 2012 Thereafter Letters of credit and surety bonds $ 108.7 $ 108.1 $ 0.6 $ $ $ $ Freight contracts 191.2 85.0 83.7 14.5 4.5 3.5 Technology assets 5.1 5.1 Total commitments $ 305.0 $ 198.2 $ 84.3 $ 14.5 $ 4.5 $ 3.5 $ 25 Lease Financing Operating Lease Obligations. Our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases. The commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to February 2, 2008 for stores that were not yet open on February 2, 2008. Capital Lease Obligations. Our capital lease obligations are primarily for distribution center equipment and computer equipment at the store support center. Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2004, we entered into a five year Revolving Credit Facility (the Facility). The Facility provides for a $450.0 million line of credit, including up to $50.0 million in available letters of credit. Interest is assessed under the line based on matrix pricing which currently approximates LIBOR, plus 0.475%. This rate was 4.47% at February 2, 2008. The Facility also bears a facilities fee, calculated as a percentage, as defined, of the amount available under the facility, payable quarterly. The Facility, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness. The Facility also bears an administrative fee payable annually. We used availability under this Facility to repay the $142.6 million of variable rate debt and to purchase short term investments. As of February 2, 2008, we had $250.0 million outstanding on this Facility. On February 20, 2008, we entered into a five year $550.0 million Credit Agreement (the Agreement). The Agreement provides for a $300.0 million revolving line of credit, including up to $150.0 million in available letters of credit, and a $250.0 million term loan. The interest rate on the facility will be based, at our option, on a LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. The revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee, calculated as a percentage, as defined, of the amount available under the line of credit, payable quarterly. The term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the Agreement. The Agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually. The Agreement, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness. Our March 2004, $450.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility was terminated concurrent with entering into the Agreement. Revenue Bond Financing. In May 1998, we entered into an agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation under which it issued $19.0 million of variable rate demand revenue bonds. We used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition, construction and installation of land, buildings, machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi. At February 2, 2008, the balance outstanding on the bonds was $18.5 million. These bonds are due to be fully repaid in June 2018. The bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable. The bonds contain a demand provision and, therefore, outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities. We pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate, which was 3.38% at February 2, 2008. Interest on Long term Borrowings. This amount represents interest payments on the revolving credit facility and the revenue bond financing using the interest rates for each at February 2, 2008. Commitments Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds. In March 2001, we entered into a Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, which provides $125.0 million for letters of credit. In December 2004, we entered into an additional Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, which provides $50.0 million for letters of credit. Letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately $88.9 million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at February 2, 2008. We also have approximately $19.8 million of letters of credit or surety bonds outstanding for our self insurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores. Freight Contracts. We have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through February 2013. The total amount of these commitments is approximately $191.2 million. 26 Technology Assets. We have commitments totaling approximately $5.1 million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2008. Derivative Financial Instruments We are party to one interest rate swap, which allows us to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds. The swap is based on a notional amount of $18.5 million. Under the $18.5 million agreement, as amended, we pay interest to the bank that provided the swap at a fixed rate. In exchange, the financial institution pays us at a variable interest rate, which is similar to the rate on the demand revenue bonds. The variable interest rate on the interest rate swap is set monthly. No payments are made by either party under the swap for monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than a predetermined rate (the knock out rate). The swap may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates and expires in 2009. Because of the knock out provision in the $18.5 million swap, changes in the fair value of that swap are recorded in earnings. For more information on the interest rate swaps, see Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk beginning on page 29 of this Form 10 K. On March 20, 2008, we entered into two $75.0 million interest rate swap agreements. These interest rate swaps are used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our $250.0 million variable rate term note. Under these agreements, we pay interest to financial institutions at a fixed rate of 2.8%. In exchange, the financial institutions pay us at a variable rate, which approximates the variable rate on the debt, excluding the credit spread. We believe these swaps are highly effective as the interest reset dates and the underlying interest rate indices are identical for the swaps and the debt. These swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment pursuant to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. These swaps expire in March 2011. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. Certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates. Following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical. Inventory Valuation As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted average basis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. The retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis. Inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. The averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period. We estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or seasonal, carryover merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results. Our accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. Our physical inventory counts are generally taken between January and September of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at February 2, 2008 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2007, including the fourth quarter. We have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 10 basis points in our Dollar Tree stores for the last two years. However, we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition. We periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent. 27 Our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis. Accrued Expenses On a monthly basis, we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred. Our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses, self insurance programs, store level operating expenses, such as property taxes and utilities, and certain other expenses. Our freight and store level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results. Our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted annually based on a review performed by a third party actuary. These actuarial valuations are estimates based on historical loss development factors. Certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them. The related accruals are adjusted as managements estimates change. Differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual. Our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low. Historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates, including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing, applied to the income expected to be taxed currently. Management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and managements projections for future taxable income. We cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual. In addition, we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws, including relevant case law, and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded. We believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate. For further discussion of our changes in reserves during 2007, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 42 of this Form 10 K. Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales, comparable store net sales, operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue. Our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including: Shifts in the timing of certain holidays, especially Easter; The timing of new store openings; The net sales contributed by new stores; changes in our merchandise mix; and competition. 28 Our highest sales periods are the Christmas and Easter seasons. Easter was observed on April 16, 2006, April 8, 2007, and will be observed on March 23, 2008. We believe that the earlier Easter in 2008 could potentially result in $25 million of lost sales when compared to the first quarter of 2007. We generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter. In anticipation of increased sales activity during these months, we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff. Our operating results, particularly operating and net income, could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the Easter season for any reason, including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems, consumer sentiment or inclement weather. Fiscal 2006 consisted of 53 weeks, commensurate with the retail calendar. This extra week contributed approximately $70 million of sales in 2006 compared to 2007. Fiscal 2007 consisted of 52 weeks. In fiscal 2008, there is one fewer weekend between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared to fiscal 2007. We believe this could potentially reduce the total foot traffic in our stores for the Christmas holiday in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in Footnote 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Inflation and Other Economic Factors Our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control. Consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures, including rising fuel prices. Reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales. National or international events, including war or terrorism, could lead to disruptions in economies in the United States or in foreign countries where we purchase some of our merchandise. These and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations, such as shipping and wage rates. Shipping Costs. Currently, trans Pacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs. As a result, our trans Pacific shipping costs in fiscal 2008 may increase compared with fiscal 2007 when we renegotiate our import shipping rates effective May 2008. We can give no assurances as to the amount of the increase, as we are in the early stages of our negotiations. Minimum Wage. On May 25, 2007, the President signed legislation that increased the Federal Minimum Wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an hour by June 2009. We do not expect this legislation to have a material effect on our operations in fiscal 2008. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurement (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157, effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2007, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. We will adopt this statement in the first quarter of 2008 and we do not expect it to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures, and transition. We adopted FIN 48 in the first quarter of 2007. For further discussion of the effect of the adoption of FIN 48, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes 1 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 37 of this Form 10 K. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency rate fluctuations. We may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes, and we may employ other risk management strategies, including the use of foreign currency forward contracts. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes. 29 Interest Rate Risk We use variable rate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements. These obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, interest expense increases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, interest expense also decreases. We believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments. To meet this objective, we entered into a derivative instrument in the form of an interest rate swap to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variable interest rates on the Demand Revenue Bonds. The interest rate swap reduces the interest rate exposure on this variable rate obligation. Under the interest rate swap, we pay the bank at a fixed rate and receive variable interest at a rate approximating the variable rate on the obligation, thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed rate obligation. Under the swap, no payments are made by parties under the swap for monthly periods in which the variable interest rate is greater than the predetermined knock out rate. The following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap agreement and the fair value of the interest rate swap at February 2, 2008: Hedging Instrument Receive Variable Pay Fixed Knock out Rate Expiration Fair Value $18.5 million interest rate swap LIBOR 4.88% 7.75% 4/1/09 $0.5 million Hypothetically, a 1% change in interest rates results in approximately a $0.2 million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement on an annual basis. Due to many factors, management is not able to predict the changes in fair value of our interest rate swap. These fair values are obtained from an outside financial institution. On March 20, 2008, we entered into two $75.0 million interest rate swap agreements. These interest rate swaps are used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our $250.0 million variable rate term note. Under these agreements, we pay interest to financial institutions at a fixed rate of 2.8%. In exchange, the financial institutions pay us at a variable rate, which approximates the variable rate on the debt, excluding the credit spread. We believe these swaps are highly effective as the interest reset dates and the underlying interest rate indices are identical for the swaps and the debt. These swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment pursuant to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and expire in March 2011. 30
