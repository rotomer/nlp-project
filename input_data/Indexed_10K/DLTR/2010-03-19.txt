Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company, including: what factors affect our business; what our net sales, earnings, gross margins and costs were in 2009, 2008 and 2007; why those net sales, earnings, gross margins and costs were different from the year before; how all of this affects our overall financial condition; what our expenditures for capital projects were in 2009 and 2008 and what we expect them to be in 2010; and where funds will come from to pay for future expenditures. As you read Managements Discussion and Analysis, please refer to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended January 30, 2010, January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008. In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2009 compared to the comparable fiscal year 2008 and the fiscal year 2008 compared to the comparable fiscal year 2007. Key Events and Recent Developments Several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations. You should keep in mind that: We assign cost to store inventories using the retail inventory method, determined on a weighted average cost basis. Since inception through fiscal 2009, we have used one inventory pool for this calculation. Over the years, we have invested in our retail technology systems, which has allowed us to refine our estimate of inventory cost under the retail method. On January, 31, 2010, the first day of fiscal 2010, we will use approximately 30 inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation. As a result of this change, we will record a non cash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory, at cost, of approximately $26 million in the first quarter of 2010. This is a prospective change and will not have any effect on prior periods. On November 2, 2009, we purchased a new distribution center in San Bernardino, California. We have spent approximately $31.0 million in capital expenditures for this new distribution center through fiscal 2009. We plan to spend an additional $6.0 million in the first quarter of 2010 to finish the project before the building starts receiving merchandise. This new distribution center will replace our Salt Lake City, Utah leased facility when its lease ends in April 2010. On February 20, 2008, we entered into a five year $550.0 million unsecured Credit Agreement (the Agreement). The Agreement provides for a $300.0 million revolving line of credit, including up to $150.0 million in available letters of credit, and a $250.0 million term loan. The interest rate on the facility is based, at our option, on a LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. On March 20, 2008, we entered into two $75.0 million interest rate swap agreements. These interest rate swaps are used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our $250.0 million variable rate term loan. Overview Our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions. Second, sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. We refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales, because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared. We include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. The term expanded also includes stores that are relocated. 18 At January 30, 2010, we operated 3,806 stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia, with 32.3 million selling square feet compared to 3,591 stores with 30.3 million selling square feet at January 31, 2009. During fiscal 2009, we opened 240 stores, expanded 75 stores and closed 25 stores, compared to 231 new stores opened, 86 stores expanded and 51 stores closed during fiscal 2008. In the current year we increased our selling square footage by 6.6%. Of the 2.0 million selling square foot increase in 2009, 0.3 million was added by expanding existing stores. The average size of our stores opened in 2009 was approximately 8,500 selling square feet (or about 10,800 gross square feet). For 2010, we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8,000 10,000 selling square feet (or about 10,000 12,000 gross square feet). We believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an ideal shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more. In fiscal 2009, comparable store net sales increased by 7.2%. The comparable store net sales increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of transactions. We believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our initiatives, as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in 2009, and we continued the roll out of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our stores. At January 30, 2010 we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 1,400 stores compared to approximately 1,200 stores at January 31, 2009. We believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers. In addition, we accept food stamps (under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)) in approximately 2,900 qualified stores compared to 2,200 at the end of 2008. With the pressures of the current economic environment, we have seen increases in the demand for basic, consumable products in 2009. As a result, we have shifted the mix of inventory carried in our stores to more consumer product merchandise which we believe increases the traffic in our stores and has helped to increase our sales even during the current economic downturn. While this shift in mix has impacted our merchandise costs we were able to offset that impact in the current year with decreased costs for merchandise in many of our categories. Our point of sale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores. We believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations and increased inventory turnover for each of the last five years. Inventory turnover improved by approximately 25 basis points in 2009 to over 4 turns for the year. Inventory per selling square foot also decreased 5.6% at January 30, 2010 compared to January 31, 2009. In May 2007, legislation was enacted that increased the Federal Minimum Wage. The last increase to $7.25 an hour was effective in July 2009. As a result, our wages have increased in the third quarter of 2009 and wages will continue to increase through the first half of 2010; however, we believe that we can offset the increase in payroll costs through increased productivity and continued efficiencies in product flow to our stores. We must continue to control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses. Increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results. 19 Results of Operations The following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations, as a percentage of net sales: Year Ended Year Ended Year Ended January 30, January 31, February 2, 2010 2009 2008 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 64.5 % 65.7 % 65.6 % Gross profit 35.5 % 34.3 % 34.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 25.7 % 26.4 % 26.6 % Operating income 9.8 % 7.9 % 7.8 % Interest income 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.1 % Interest expense (0.1 %) (0.2 %) (0.4 %) Income before income taxes 9.7 % 7.7 % 7.5 % Provision for income taxes (3.6 %) (2.8 %) (2.8 %) Net income 6.1 % 4.9 % 4.7 % Fiscal year ended January 30, 2010 compared to fiscal year ended January 31, 2009 Net Sales. Net sales increased 12.6%, or $586.3 million, in 2009 compared to 2008, resulting from a 7.2% increase in comparable store net sales and sales in our new stores. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones. The following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009. January 30, 2010 January 31, 2009 New stores 240 227 Acquired leases 4 Expanded or relocated stores 75 86 Closed stores (25 ) (51 ) Of the 2.0 million selling square foot increase in 2009 approximately 0.3 million was added by expanding existing stores. Gross profit margin increased to 35.5% in 2009 compared to 34.3% in 2008. The increase was due to the following: Merchandise costs, including inbound freight, decreased 80 basis points due primarily to lower fuel costs and lower ocean freight rates compared to the prior year. Improved initial mark up in many categories during the year was partially offset by an increase in the mix of higher cost consumer product merchandise during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Outbound freight costs decreased 20 basis points in the current year due primarily to decreased fuel costs. Occupancy and distribution costs decreased 30 basis points in the current year resulting from the leveraging of the comparable store sales increase. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 25.7% for 2009 compared to 26.4% for 2008. The decrease is primarily due to the following: Depreciation decreased 40 basis points primarily due to the leveraging associated with the increase in comparable store net sales in the current year. Store operating costs decreased 30 basis points primarily as a result of lower utility costs as a percentage of sales, due to lower rates in the current year and the leveraging from the comparable store net sales increase in 2009. 20 Operating Income. Due to the reasons discussed above, operating income margin was 9.8% in 2009 compared to 7.9% in 2008. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 36.9% in 2009 compared to 36.1% in 2008. The higher rate in the current year was the result of the favorable settlement of several state tax audits in 2008 and a higher blended state tax rate in 2009. Fiscal year ended January 31, 2009 compared to fiscal year ended February 2, 2008 Net Sales. Net sales increased 9.5%, or $402.3 million, in 2008 compared to 2007, resulting from sales in our new and expanded stores and a 4.1% increase in comparable store net sales. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones. The following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008. January 31, 2009 February 2, 2008 New stores 227 208 Acquired leases 4 32 Expanded or relocated stores 86 102 Closed stores (51 ) (48 ) Of the 1.9 million selling square foot increase in 2008 approximately 0.3 million was added by expanding existing stores. Gross Profit. Gross profit margin decreased to 34.3% in 2008 compared to 34.4% in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to a 30 basis point increase in merchandise cost, including inbound freight, resulting from an increase in the sales mix of higher cost consumer product merchandise and higher diesel fuel costs compared with 2007. Partially offsetting this increase was a 20 basis point decrease in shrink expense due to favorable adjustments to shrink estimates based on actual inventory results during the year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 26.4% for 2008 compared to 26.6% for 2007. The decrease is primarily due to the following: Depreciation expense decreased 25 basis points primarily due to the leveraging associated with the comparable store net sales increase for the year. Payroll related expenses decreased 10 basis points primarily as a result of lower field payroll costs as a percentage of sales, due to the leveraging from the comparable store net sales increase in 2008. Partially offsetting these decreases was an approximate 10 basis point increase in store operating costs due to increases in repairs and maintenance and utility costs in the current year. Operating Income. Due to the reasons discussed above, operating income margin was 7.9% in 2008 compared to 7.8% in 2007. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 36.1% in 2008 compared to 37.1% in 2007. The lower rate in the 2008 reflects the recognition of certain tax benefits and a lower blended state tax rate resulting from the settlement of state tax audits in 2008 which allowed us to release income tax reserves and accrue less interest expense on tax uncertainties. These benefits to the tax rate were partially offset by a reduction in tax exempt interest income in 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our business requires capital to build and open new stores, expand our distribution network and operate existing stores. Our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in September and October. Historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities. 21 The following table compares cash flow related information for the years ended January 30, 2010, January 31, 2009, and February 2, 2008: Year Ended Year Ended Year Ended January 30, January 31, February 2, (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 581.0 $ 403.1 $ 367.3 Investing activities (212.5 ) (102.0 ) (22.7 ) Financing activities (161.3 ) 22.7 (389.0 ) Net cash provided by operating activities increased $177.9 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to increased earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization in the current year. Also providing more cash at January 30, 2010 was better inventory management resulting in lower inventory balances per store and higher accounts payable balances due to the timing of payments and increased incentive compensation accruals. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $35.8 million in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increased earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2008 and lower prepaid rent amounts at the end of January 2009. February 2008 rent payments were made prior to the end of fiscal 2007 which resulted in a prepaid asset in fiscal 2007 whereas February 2009 rent was paid in fiscal 2009. Net cash used in investing activities increased $110.5 million in the current year primarily due to short term investment activity and increased capital expenditures in 2009. In 2008 we liquidated our short term investments due to market conditions. The net proceeds from this liquidation of $40.5 million were put into cash equivalent money market accounts. In 2009 we also purchased $27.8 million of short term investments late in the year. Capital expenditures increased $33.5 million in 2009 primarily due to the purchase of our new distribution center in San Bernardino, CA. We have spent approximately $31.0 million on this project through the end of fiscal 2009 and expect to spend approximately $6.0 million in the first quarter of 2010 to complete the project. Net cash used in investing activities increased $79.3 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Net proceeds from the sale of short term investments were higher in 2007 in order to fund share repurchases. Overall, short term investment activity decreased in 2008 resulting from the liquidation of our short term investments early in 2008 due to market conditions. These amounts were primarily invested in cash equivalent money market accounts. Partially offsetting the decrease in net proceeds from the sales of short term investments was higher capital expenditures ($57.7 million higher) in 2007 due to the expansions of the Briar Creek distribution center and corporate headquarters. In 2009, net cash used in financing activities was $161.3 million as a result of share repurchases of $190.7 million partially offset by stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases. In the prior year, net cash provided by financing activities was $22.7 million. This was the result of stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases. In fiscal 2008, financing activities provided cash of $22.7 million as a result of stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases. In 2007, net cash used in financing activities was $389.0 million. This was the result of share repurchases of $473.0 million for fiscal 2007, partially offset by stock option exercises resulting from the Companys stock price in 2008 being higher than it had been in the prior several years. At January 30, 2010, our long term borrowings were $267.5 million and our capital lease commitments were $0.3 million. We also have $121.5 million and $50.0 million Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreements, under which approximately $101.8 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at January 30, 2010. On February 20, 2008, we entered into a five year $550.0 million unsecured Credit Agreement (the Agreement). The Agreement provides for a $300.0 million revolving line of credit, including up to $150.0 million in available letters of credit, and a $250.0 million term loan. The interest rate on the Agreement is based, at our option, on a LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. The revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee, calculated as a percentage, as defined, of the amount available under the line of credit, payable quarterly. The term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the Agreement. The Agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually. The Agreement, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness. As of January 30, 2010, the $250.0 million term loan is outstanding under the Agreement and there were no amounts outstanding under the $300.0 million revolving line of credit. 22 We repurchased approximately 4.3 million shares for approximately $193.1 million in fiscal 2009. Less than 0.1 million of these shares totaling $2.4 million had not settled as of January 30, 2010 and these amounts have been accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 30, 2010. We repurchased 12.8 million shares for approximately $473.0 million in fiscal 2007. We had no share repurchases in fiscal 2008. At January 30, 2010, we have approximately $260.6 million remaining under Board authorization. Funding Requirements Overview We expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2010 to total approximately $136.0 million, which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre opening costs. Our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 are between $155.0 and $165.0 million, including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores and the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 225 stores. We believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facility. The following tables summarize our material contractual obligations at January 30, 2010, including both on and off balance sheet arrangements, and our commitments, including interest on long term borrowings (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Lease Financing Operating lease obligations $ 1,518.7 $ 372.8 $ 326.9 $ 269.3 $ 202.7 $ 140.2 $ 206.8 Capital lease obligations 0.3 0.1 0.1 0.1 Long term Borrowings Credit Agreement 250.0 250.0 Revenue bond financing 17.5 17.5 Interest on long term borrowings 10.2 5.6 2.5 1.9 0.2 Total obligations $ 1,796.7 $ 396.0 $ 329.5 $ 271.3 $ 452.9 $ 140.2 $ 206.8 Commitments Total Expiring in 2010 Expiring in 2011 Expiring in 2012 Expiring in 2013 Expiring in 2014 Thereafter Letters of credit and surety bonds $ 119.2 $ 119.0 $ 0.2 $ $ $ $ Freight contracts 296.2 99.2 85.8 84.3 26.9 Technology assets 2.4 2.4 Total commitments $ 417.8 $ 220.6 $ 86.0 $ 84.3 $ 26.9 $ $ 23 Lease Financing Operating Lease Obligations. Our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases. The commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to January 30, 2010 for stores that were not yet open on January 30, 2010. Capital Lease Obligations. Our capital lease obligations are primarily for distribution center equipment and computer equipment at the store support center. Credit Agreement. On February 20, 2008, we entered into a five year $550.0 million unsecured Credit Agreement (the Agreement). The Agreement provides for a $300.0 million revolving line of credit, including up to $150.0 million in available letters of credit, and a $250.0 million term loan. The interest rate on the facility will be based, at our option, on a LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. The interest rate on the facility was 0.74% at January 30, 2010. The revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee, calculated as a percentage, as defined, of the amount available under the line of credit, payable quarterly. The term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the Agreement. The Agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually. The Agreement, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness. As of January 30, 2010, we had the $250.0 million term loan outstanding under the Agreement and no amounts outstanding under the $300.0 million revolving line of credit. Revenue Bond Financing. In May 1998, we entered into an agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation under which it issued $19.0 million of variable rate demand revenue bonds. We used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition, construction and installation of land, buildings, machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi. At January 30, 2010, the balance outstanding on the bonds was $17.5 million. These bonds are due to be fully repaid in June 2018. The bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable. The bonds contain a demand provision and, therefore, outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities. We pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate, which was 0.25% at January 30, 2010. Interest on Long term Borrowings. This amount represents interest payments on the Credit Agreement and the revenue bond financing using the interest rates for each at January 30, 2010. Commitments Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds. In March 2001, we entered into a Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, which provides $121.5 million for letters of credit. In December 2004, we entered into an additional Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, which provides $50.0 million for letters of credit. Letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately $101.8 million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at January 30, 2010. We also have approximately $17.4 million of letters of credit or surety bonds outstanding for our self insurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores. Freight Contracts. We have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through fiscal 2013. The total amount of these commitments is approximately $296.2 million. Technology Assets. We have commitments totaling approximately $2.4 million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2010. Derivative Financial Instruments On March 20, 2008, we entered into two $75.0 million interest rate swap agreements. These interest rate swaps are used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our $250.0 million variable rate term loan. Under these agreements, we pay interest to financial institutions at a fixed rate of 2.8%. In exchange, the financial institutions pay us at a variable rate, which approximates the variable rate on the debt, excluding the credit spread. These swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment and expire in March 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we entered into fuel derivative contracts with a third party. As a result of these contracts, we have fixed the fuel price on 2.4 million gallons of diesel fuel, or approximately 25% of our fuel needs from May 2010 through January 2011. These derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives will be included directly in earnings. 24 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. Certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates. Following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical. Inventory Valuation As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted average basis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. Since our inception through fiscal 2009, we have used one inventory pool for this calculation. Over the years, we have invested in our retail technology systems, which has allowed us to refine our estimate of inventory cost under the retail method. On January, 31, 2010, the first day of fiscal 2010, we began using approximately 30 inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation. As a result of this change, we expect to record a non cash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory, at cost, of approximately $26 million in the first quarter of 2010. The retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis. Inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. The averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period. We estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or seasonal, carryover merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results. Our accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. Our physical inventory counts are generally taken between January and September of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at January 30, 2010 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2009, including the fourth quarter. We have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 10 20 basis points in our Dollar Tree stores for the last few years. However, we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition. We periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent. Our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis. Accrued Expenses On a monthly basis, we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred. Our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses, self insurance costs, store level operating expenses, such as property taxes and utilities, and certain other expenses, such as legal reserves. Our freight and store level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results. Our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted at least annually based on a review performed by a third party actuary. These actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors. Certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them. The related accruals are adjusted as managements estimates change. Differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual. Our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low. Historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our legal proceedings are described in Item 3 Legal Proceedings beginning on page 14 of this Form 10 K. The outcome of litigation, particularly class or collective action lawsuits, is difficult to assess, quantify or predict. 25 Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates, including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing, applied to the income expected to be taxed currently. Management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and managements projections for future taxable income. We cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual. In addition, we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns. Judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws, including relevant case law, and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded. We believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate. For further discussion of our changes in reserves during 2009, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 39 of this Form 10 K. Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales, comparable store net sales, operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue. Our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including: shifts in the timing of certain holidays, especially Easter; the timing of new store openings; the net sales contributed by new stores; changes in our merchandise mix; and competition. Our highest sales periods are the Christmas and Easter seasons. Easter was observed on March 23, 2008, April 12, 2009, and will be observed on April 4, 2010. We believe that the earlier Easter in 2010 could result in a $10.0 million decrease in sales in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to the first quarter of 2009. We generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter. In anticipation of increased sales activity during these months, we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff. Our operating results, particularly operating and net income, could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the Easter season for any reason, including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems, consumer sentiment or inclement weather. Our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in Footnote 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Inflation and Other Economic Factors Our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control. Consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures, including unemployment and rising fuel prices. Reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales. National or international events, including war or terrorism, could lead to disruptions in economies in the United States or in foreign countries where we purchase some of our merchandise. These and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations, such as shipping and wage rates. Shipping Costs. Currently, trans Pacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs. We can give no assurances as to the final actual rates for 2010, as we are in the early stages of our negotiations. Minimum Wage. On May 25, 2007, legislation was enacted that increased the Federal Minimum Wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an hour in July 2009. As a result, our wages increased in 2009 and will continue to increase through the first half of 2010; however, we believe that we can partially offset the increase in payroll costs through increased productivity and continued efficiencies in product flow to our stores. 26 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes and diesel fuel cost changes. We may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk We use variable rate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements. These obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, interest expense increases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, interest expense also decreases. We believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments. To meet this objective, we entered into derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variable interest rates on a portion of our $250.0 million term loan. The interest rate swaps reduce the interest rate exposure on these variable rate obligations. Under the interest rate swaps, we pay the bank at a fixed rate and receive variable interest at a rate approximating the variable rate on the obligation, thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed rate obligation. We entered into two $75.0 million interest rate swap agreements in March 2008 to manage the risk associated with the interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our $250.0 million variable rate term loan. The following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap agreements and the fair value of the interest rate swaps at January 30, 2010: Hedging Instrument Receive Variable Pay Fixed Knock out Rate Expiration Fair Value (Liability) Two $75.0 million interest rate swaps LIBOR 2.80% N/A 3/31/11 ($4.1 million) Hypothetically, a 1% change in interest rates results in an approximate $1.5 million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement on an annual basis. Due to many factors, management is not able to predict the changes in the fair values of our interest rate swaps. These fair values are obtained from our outside financial institutions. Diesel Fuel Cost Risk In order to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in diesel fuel costs, we entered into fuel derivative contracts with a third party in the fourth quarter of 2009 for 2.4 million gallons of diesel fuel, or approximately 25% of our fuel needs from May 2010 through January 2011. Under these contracts, we pay the third party a fixed price for diesel fuel and receive variable diesel fuel prices at amounts approximating current diesel fuel costs, thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed rate obligation. These derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for this derivative will be included directly in earnings. The fair value of these contracts at January 30, 2010 was a liability of $0.2 million. 27
