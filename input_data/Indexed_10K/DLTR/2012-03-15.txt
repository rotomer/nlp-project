Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company, including: what factors affect our business; what our net sales, earnings, gross margins and costs were in 2011, 2010 and 2009; why those net sales, earnings, gross margins and costs were different from the year before; how all of this affects our overall financial condition; what our expenditures for capital projects were in 2011 and 2010 and what we expect them to be in 2012; and where funds will come from to pay for future expenditures. As you read Managements Discussion and Analysis, please refer to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2012, January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010. In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 and for fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009. Key Events and Recent Developments Several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations. You should keep in mind that: On October 7, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $1.5 billion of our common stock. At January 28, 2012, we had approximately $1.2 billion remaining under Board authorizations. On October 7, 2011, we completed a 410,000 square foot expansion of our distribution center in Savannah, Georgia. The Savannah distribution center is now a 1,014,000 square foot, fully automated facility. On November 15, 2010, we completed our acquisition of 86 Dollar Giant stores, located in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta and Saskatchewan and we have since opened a store in Manitoba. These stores offer a wide assortment of quality general merchandise, contemporary seasonal goods and everyday consumables, all priced at $1.25 (CAD) or less. This is our first expansion of retail operations outside of the United States. We assign cost to store inventories using the retail inventory method, determined on a weighted average cost basis. From our inception and through fiscal 2009, we used one inventory pool for this calculation. Because of our investments over the years in our retail technology systems, we were able to refine our estimate of inventory cost under the retail method and on January 31, 2010, the first day of fiscal 2010, we began using approximately 30 inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation. As a result of this change, we recorded a non recurring, non cash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory, at cost, of $26.3 million in the first quarter of 2010. This was a prospective change and did not have any effect on prior periods. On November 2, 2009, we purchased a new distribution center in San Bernardino, California. This new distribution center replaced our Salt Lake City, Utah leased facility whose lease ended in April 2010. On February 20, 2008, we entered into a five year $550.0 million unsecured Credit Agreement (the Agreement). The Agreement provides for a $300.0 million revolving line of credit, including up to $150.0 million in available letters of credit, and a $250.0 million term loan. The interest rate on the facility is based, at our option, on a LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. 19 Overview Our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions. Second, sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. We refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales, because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared. We include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. The term expanded also includes stores that are relocated. At January 28, 2012, we operated 4,351 stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, with 37.6 million selling square feet compared to 4,101 stores with 35.1 million selling square feet at January 29, 2011. During fiscal 2011, we opened 278 stores, expanded 91 stores and closed 28 stores, compared to 235 new stores opened, 95 stores expanded, 86 stores acquired and 26 stores closed during fiscal 2010. In the current year we increased our selling square footage by 6.9%. Of the 2.4 million selling square foot increase in 2011, 0.3 million was added by expanding existing stores. The average size of our stores opened in 2011 was approximately 8,360 selling square feet (or about 10,280 gross square feet). For 2012, we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8,000 10,000 selling square feet (or about 10,000 12,000 gross square feet). We believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an ideal shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more. In fiscal 2011, comparable store net sales increased by 6.0%. The comparable store net sales increase was the result of a 4.8% increase in the number of transactions and a 1.2% increase in average ticket. We believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our initiatives, as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in 2011, and we continued the roll out of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our stores. At January 28, 2012 we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 2,220 stores compared to approximately 1,840 stores at January 29, 2011. We believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers. In addition, we accept food stamps (under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)) in approximately 3,860 qualified stores compared to 3,500 at the end of 2010. With the pressures of the current economic environment, we have seen continued demand for basic, consumable products in 2011. As a result, we have continued to shift the mix of inventory carried in our stores to more consumer product merchandise which we believe increases the traffic in our stores and has helped to increase our sales even during the current economic downturn. While this shift in mix has impacted our merchandise costs we were able to offset that impact in the current year with decreased costs for merchandise in many of our categories. Our point of sale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores. We believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations and increased inventory turnover for each of the last five years. In 2007, legislation was enacted that increased the Federal Minimum Wage. The last increase to $7.25 an hour was effective in July 2009. As a result, our wages increased in the third quarter of 2009 through the first half of 2010 compared with the comparable period in the prior year; however, we offset the increase in payroll costs through increased productivity and continued efficiencies in product flow to our stores. We must continue to control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results. 20 Results of Operations The following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations, as a percentage of net sales. On January 31, 2010, the first day of fiscal 2010, we began using approximately 30 inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation, rather than one inventory pool as we had done since our inception. As a result of this change, we recorded a non recurring, non cash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory, at cost, of $26.3 million in the first quarter of 2010. Year Ended January 28, January 29, January 30, 2012 2011 2010 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, excluding non cash beginning inventory adjustment 64.1 % 64.1 % 64.5 % Non cash beginning inventory adjustment 0.0 % 0.4 % 0.0 % Gross profit 35.9 % 35.5 % 35.5 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 24.1 % 24.8 % 25.7 % Operating income 11.8 % 10.7 % 9.8 % Interest expense,net (0.1 %) (0.1 %) Other income, net 0.1 % Income before income taxes 11.8 % 10.7 % 9.7 % Provision for income taxes (4.4 %) (3.9 %) (3.6 %) Net income 7.4 % 6.8 % 6.1 % Fiscal year ended January 28, 2012 compared to fiscal year ended January 29, 2011 Net Sales. Net sales increased 12.7%, or $748.0 million, in 2011 compared to 2010, resulting from sales in our new stores and a 6.0% increase in comparable store net sales. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones. The following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011. January 28, 2012 January 29, 2011 New stores 278 235 Acquired stores 86 Expanded or relocated stores 91 95 Closed stores (28 ) (26 ) Of the 2.4 million selling square foot increase in 2011 approximately 0.3 million was added by expanding existing stores. Gross profit margin was 35.9% in 2011 compared to 35.5% in 2010. Excluding the effect of the $26.3 million non cash beginning inventory adjustment, gross profit margin remained at 35.9%. Improvement in initial mark up in many categories and occupancy and distribution cost leverage were offset by an increase in the mix of higher cost consumer product merchandise and a smaller reduction in the shrink accrual rate in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 24.1% for 2011 compared to 24.8% for 2010. The decrease is primarily due to the following: Payroll expenses decreased 45 basis points due to leveraging associated with the increase in comparable store net sales in the current year, lower store hourly payroll and lower incentive compensation achievement. Depreciation decreased 25 basis points primarily due to the leveraging associated with the increase in comparable store net sales in the current year. 21 Operating Income. Operating income margin was 11.8% in 2011 compared to 10.7% in 2010. Excluding the $26.3 million non cash adjustment to beginning inventory, operating income margin was 11.1% in 2010. Due to the reasons noted above, operating income margin excluding this charge, improved 70 basis points. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 37.4% in 2011 and 36.9% in 2010. Fiscal year ended January 29, 2011 compared to fiscal year ended January 30, 2010 Net Sales. Net sales increased 12.4%, or $651.2 million, in 2010 compared to 2009, resulting from a 6.3% increase in comparable store net sales and sales in our new stores. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones. The following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010. January 29, 2011 January 30, 2010 New stores 235 240 Acquired stores 86 Expanded or relocated stores 95 75 Closed stores (26 ) (25 ) Of the 2.9 million selling square foot increase in 2010, approximately 0.4 million was added by expanding existing stores and 0.7 million was the result of the acquisition of the Dollar Giant stores. Gross profit margin was 35.5% in 2010 and 2009. Excluding the effect of the $26.3 million non cash beginning inventory adjustment, gross profit margin increased to 35.9%. This increase was due to the net of the following: Occupancy and distribution costs decreased 30 basis points in the current year resulting from the leveraging of the comparable store sales increase. Shrink costs decreased 15 basis points due to improved shrink results in the current year and a lower shrink accrual rate during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Merchandise costs, including freight, increased 15 basis points due primarily to higher import and domestic freight costs during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 24.8% for 2010 compared to 25.7% for 2009. The decrease is primarily due to the following: Payroll expenses decreased 45 basis points due to leveraging associated with the increase in comparable store net sales in the current year and lower store hourly payroll. Depreciation decreased 30 basis points primarily due to the leveraging associated with the increase in comparable store net sales in the current year. Store operating costs decreased 20 basis points primarily as a result of lower utility costs as a percentage of sales, due to lower rates in the current year and the leveraging from the comparable store net sales increase in 2010. Operating Income. Operating income margin was 10.7% in 2010 compared to 9.8% in 2009. Excluding the $26.3 million non cash adjustment to beginning inventory, operating income margin was 11.1%. Due to the reasons noted above, operating income margin, excluding this charge, improved 130 basis points. Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 36.9% in 2010 and 2009. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our business requires capital to build and open new stores, expand our distribution network and operate and expand existing stores. Our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in September and October. Historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities. 22 The following table compares cash flow related information for the years ended January 28, 2012, January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010: Year Ended January 28, January 29, January 30, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 686.5 $ 518.7 $ 581.0 Investing activities (86.1 ) (374.1 ) (212.5 ) Financing activities (623.2 ) (404.3 ) (161.3 ) Net cash provided by operating activities increased $167.8 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to increased earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization in the current year, a decrease in cash used to purchase merchandise inventories and an increase in other current liabilities due to increases in sales tax collected and accrued expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $62.3 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in cash used to purchase merchandise inventories partially offset by increased earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization in the current year. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $288.0 million in 2011 primarily due to an additional $170.0 million of proceeds from the sale of short term investments with minimal purchases of short term investments compared to $157.8 million of purchases in 2010. The proceeds were used to fund the share repurchases in 2011. In addition, in 2010 we used $49.4 million to acquire Dollar Giant. These increased sources of cash were partially offset by a $71.4 million increase in capital expenditures in 2011 due to funds for new store projects and the expansion of our distribution center in Savannah, Georgia. Net cash used in investing activities increased $161.6 million in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to short term investment activity and the Dollar Giant acquisition. In 2010 we purchased $157.8 million of short term investments compared to $27.8 million in 2009. This was partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sales of short term investments of $10.8 million in 2010. In 2011, net cash used in financing activities increased $218.9 million as a result of increased share repurchases in 2011. In 2010, net cash used in financing activities increased $243.0 million as a result of increased share repurchases in 2010 and payments of $13.8 million for debt acquired from Dollar Giant. At January 28, 2012, our long term borrowings were $265.5 million and our capital lease commitments were $0.3 million. We also have $110.0 million and $75.0 million Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreements, under which approximately $139.5 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at January 28, 2012. In February 2008, we entered into a five year $550.0 million unsecured Credit Agreement (the Agreement). The Agreement provides for a $300.0 million revolving line of credit, including up to $150.0 million in available letters of credit, and a $250.0 million term loan. The interest rate on the Agreement is based, at our option, on a LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. The revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee, calculated as a percentage, as defined, of the amount available under the line of credit, payable quarterly. The term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the Agreement. The Agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually. The Agreement, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness. As of January 28, 2012, the $250.0 million term loan is outstanding under the Agreement and there were no amounts outstanding under the $300.0 million revolving line of credit. 23 We repurchased 8.7 million shares for $645.9 million in fiscal 2011. We repurchased 9.3 million shares for $414.7 million in fiscal 2010. We repurchased 6.4 million shares for $193.1 million in fiscal 2009. At January 28, 2012, we have $1.2 billion remaining under Board authorization. Funding Requirements Overview, Including Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2012 to total approximately $205.9 million, which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre opening costs. Our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 are between $330.0 and $340.0 million, including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores, the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 325 stores and approximately $80.0 million to construct a new distribution center in the Northeast United States. We believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facility. The following tables summarize our material contractual obligations at January 28, 2012, including both on and off balance sheet arrangements, and our commitments, including interest on long term borrowings (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Lease Financing Operating lease obligations $ 1,929.0 $ 452.9 $ 401.1 $ 337.5 $ 264.4 $ 182.1 $ 291.0 Capital lease obligations 0.3 0.3 Long term Borrowings Credit Agreement 250.0 250.0 Revenue bond financing 15.5 15.5 Interest on long term borrowings 2.1 1.9 0.2 Total obligations $ 2,196.9 $ 470.6 $ 651.3 $ 337.5 $ 264.4 $ 182.1 $ 291.0 Commitments Total Expiring in 2012 Expiring in 2013 Expiring in 2014 Expiring in 2015 Expiring in 2016 Thereafter Letters of credit and surety bonds $ 170.7 $ 170.7 $ $ $ $ $ Freight contracts 222.3 143.3 58.6 20.4 Technology assets 8.9 8.9 Telecom contracts 3.3 3.3 Total commitments $ 405.2 $ 322.9 $ 58.6 $ 23.7 $ $ $ 24 Lease Financing Operating Lease Obligations. Our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases. The commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to January 28, 2012 for stores that were not yet open on January 28, 2012. Long term Borrowings Credit Agreement. In February 2008, we entered into a five year $550.0 million unsecured Credit Agreement (the Agreement). The Agreement provides for a $300.0 million revolving line of credit, including up to $150.0 million in available letters of credit, and a $250.0 million term loan. The interest rate on the facility will be based, at our option, on a LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. The interest rate on the facility was 0.77% at January 28, 2012. The revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee, calculated as a percentage, as defined, of the amount available under the line of credit, payable quarterly. The term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the Agreement. The Agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually. The Agreement, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness. As of January 28, 2012, we had the $250.0 million term loan outstanding under the Agreement and no amounts outstanding under the $300.0 million revolving line of credit. Revenue Bond Financing. In May 1998, we entered into an agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation under which it issued $19.0 million of variable rate demand revenue bonds. We used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition, construction and installation of land, buildings, machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi. At January 28, 2012, the balance outstanding on the bonds was $15.5 million. These bonds are due to be fully repaid in June 2018. The bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable. The bonds contain a demand provision and, therefore, outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities. We pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate, which was 0.27% at January 28, 2012. Interest on Long term Borrowings. This amount represents interest payments on the Credit Agreement and the revenue bond financing using the interest rates for each at January 28, 2012. Commitments Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds. We are a party to two Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreements, one which provides $110.0 million for letters of credit and one which provides $75.0 million for letters of credit. Letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately $139.5 million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at January 28, 2012. We also have approximately $28.7 million of letters of credit and $2.5 million of surety bonds outstanding for our self insurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores. Freight Contracts. We have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through fiscal 2014. The total amount of these commitments is approximately $222.3 million. Technology Assets. We have commitments totaling approximately $8.9 million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2012. Telecom Contracts. We have contracted for telecommunication services with contracts expiring in 2014. The total amount of these commitments is approximately $3.3 million. Derivative Financial Instruments In March 2008, we entered into two $75.0 million interest rate swap agreements. These interest rate swaps were used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our $250.0 million variable rate term loan. Under these agreements, we paid interest to financial institutions at a fixed rate of 2.8%. In exchange, the financial institutions paid us at a variable rate, which approximated the variable rate on the debt, excluding the credit spread. These swaps qualified for hedge accounting treatment and expired in March 2011. In 2011, we were party to fuel derivative contracts with third parties which included approximately 3.5 million gallons of diesel fuel, or approximately 31% of our domestic truckload fuel needs. These derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings. We currently have fuel derivative contracts to hedge 2.8 million gallons of diesel fuel, or approximately 41% of our domestic truckload fuel needs from February 2012 through July 2012 and 0.5 million gallons of diesel fuel, or approximately 16% of our domestic truckload fuel needs from August 2012 through October 2012. 25 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. Certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates. Following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical. Inventory Valuation As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted average basis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. From our inception and through fiscal 2009, we used one inventory pool for this calculation. Because of our investments over the years in our retail technology systems, we were able to refine our estimate of inventory cost under the retail method and on January 31, 2010, the first day of fiscal 2010, we began using approximately 30 inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation. As a result of this change, we recorded a non recurring, non cash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory, at cost, of approximately $26.3 million in the first quarter of 2010. The retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis. Inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. The averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period. We estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or seasonal, carryover merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results. Our accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions and business trends. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. Our physical inventory counts are generally taken between January and September of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at January 28, 2012 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2011, including the fourth quarter. We have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 10 20 basis points in our Dollar Tree stores for the last few years. However, we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition. We periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent. Our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis. Accrued Expenses On a monthly basis, we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred. Our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses, self insurance costs, store level operating expenses, such as property taxes and utilities, and certain other expenses, such as legal reserves. Our freight and store level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results. Our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted at least annually based on a review performed by a third party actuary. These actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors. Certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them. The related accruals are adjusted as managements estimates change. Differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual. Our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low. Historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our legal proceedings are described in Item 3 Legal Proceedings beginning on page 14 of this Form 10 K. The outcome of litigation, particularly class or collective action lawsuits, is difficult to assess, quantify or predict. 26 Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates, including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing, applied to the income expected to be taxed currently. Management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and managements projections for future taxable income. We cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual. In addition, we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns. Judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws, including relevant case law, and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded. We believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate. For further discussion of our changes in reserves during 2011, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 40 of this Form 10 K. Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales, comparable store net sales, operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue. Our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including: shifts in the timing of certain holidays, especially Easter; the timing of new store openings; the net sales contributed by new stores; changes in our merchandise mix; and competition. Our highest sales periods are the Christmas and Easter seasons. Easter was observed on April 4, 2010, April 24, 2011, and will be observed on April 8, 2012. We believe that the earlier Easter in 2012 could result in an $8.0 million decrease in sales in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the first quarter of 2011. We generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter. In anticipation of increased sales activity during these months, we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff. Our operating results, particularly operating and net income, could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the Easter season for any reason, including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems, changes in consumer sentiment or inclement weather. Our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in Footnote 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Inflation and Other Economic Factors Our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control. Consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures, including unemployment and rising fuel prices. Reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales. National or international events, including war or terrorism, could lead to disruptions in economies in the United States or in foreign countries. These and other factors could increase our merchandise costs, fuel costs and other costs that are critical to our operations, such as shipping and wage rates. 27 Shipping Costs. Currently, trans Pacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs. We can give no assurances as to the final rate trends for 2012, as we are in the early stages of our negotiations. Minimum Wage. In 2007, legislation was enacted that increased the Federal Minimum Wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an hour over a two year period with the final increase being enacted in July 2009. As a result, our wages increased in 2009 and through the first half of 2010 compared with the prior year periods; however, we offset the increase in payroll costs through increased productivity and continued efficiencies in product flow to our stores. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes and diesel fuel cost changes. We may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk We use variable rate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements. These obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, interest expense increases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, interest expense also decreases. We believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments. To meet this objective, we entered into derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variable interest rates on a portion of our $250.0 million term loan. The interest rate swaps reduced the interest rate exposure on these variable rate obligations. Under the interest rate swaps, we paid the bank at a fixed rate and received variable interest at a rate approximating the variable rate on the obligation, thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed rate obligation. We entered into two $75.0 million interest rate swap agreements in March 2008 to manage the risk associated with the interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our $250.0 million variable rate term loan. These swaps expired in March 2011. Diesel Fuel Cost Risk In order to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in diesel fuel costs, we entered into fuel derivative contracts with third parties. We hedged 3.5 million and 5.0 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2011 and 2010, respectively. These hedges represented approximately 31% and 39% of our total domestic truckload fuel needs in 2011 and 2010, respectively. We currently have fuel derivative contracts to hedge 2.8 million gallons of diesel fuel, or approximately 41% of our domestic truckload fuel needs from February 2012 through July 2012 and 0.5 million gallons of diesel fuel, or approximately 16% of our domestic truckload fuel needs from August 2012 through October 2012. Under these contracts, we pay the third party a fixed price for diesel fuel and receive variable diesel fuel prices at amounts approximating current diesel fuel costs, thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed rate obligation. These derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings. The fair value of these contracts at January 28, 2012 was an asset of $0.6 million. 28
