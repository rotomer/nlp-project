Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Dun & Bradstreet Corporations (D&B or the Company) discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with these financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companys critical accounting 13 Table of Contents policies are revenue recognition and the use of estimates of accrued liabilities and valuation allowances. Estimates are based upon historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable in the circumstances though actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions. These policies are explained more fully in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. D&B, which provides the information, tools and expertise to help customers Decide with Confidence, is managed on a geographical basis with three operating segments: North America, Europe/ Africa/ Middle East (Europe) and Asia Pacific/ Latin America (APLA). The Company is focused on its core product lines: Risk Management Solutions (formerly known as credit), Sales & Marketing Solutions (formerly known as marketing), and Supply Management Solutions (formerly known as purchasing). In this discussion of the Companys results, revenues from Receivable Management Services (RMS) and all other divested businesses have been reclassified as RMS and Other Divested Businesses and certain prior year amounts have been adjusted to conform to the 2001 presentation. Other divested businesses include results of the Australia/ New Zealand operation and operations in other countries in APLA that underwent business model changes. D&B evaluates performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating income. For management reporting purposes, restructuring charges, transition costs and other transactions incurred in connection with the Blueprint Strategy are not allocated to any of the business segments. The following table sets forth condensed financial information derived from the Companys consolidated financial statements for the years indicated: 2001 2000 1999 Amounts in millions, except per share data Operating Revenues: North America $ 872.9 $ 868.4 $ 838.2 Europe 324.7 336.1 371.0 APLA 32.0 32.4 38.2 Total Core Revenues 1,229.6 1,236.9 1,247.4 RMS and Other Divested Businesses 79.2 180.7 160.3 Consolidated Operating Revenues $ 1,308.8 $ 1,417.6 $ 1,407.7 Operating Income (Loss): North America $ 298.3 $ 287.6 $ 255.4 Europe 25.2 (.9 ) (8.9 ) APLA (.2 ) (4.6 ) (7.3 ) Total Divisions 323.3 282.1 239.2 Corporate and Other(1) (95.5 ) (109.3 ) (78.3 ) Consolidated Operating Income 227.8 172.8 160.9 Non Operating Income (Expense) Net(2) 30.0 (21.1 ) (15.5 ) Provision for Income Taxes 101.1 78.1 64.1 Equity in Net Losses of Affiliates (3.5 ) Income from Continuing Operations $ 153.2 $ 73.6 $ 81.3 Basic Earnings Per Share of Common Stock Continuing Operations $ 1.93 $ 0.91 $ 1.00 Diluted Earnings Per Share of Common Stock Continuing Operations $ 1.88 $ 0.90 $ 0.99 14 Table of Contents (1) Corporate and Other is comprised of: 2001 2000 1999 Amounts in millions Corporate Costs $ (31.6 ) $ (35.9 ) $ (37.1 ) Transition Costs (Blueprint for Growth) (28.4 ) (2.4 ) Restructuring Charges Net (28.8 ) (41.5 ) (41.2 ) Reorganization Costs 7.0 (29.5 ) Asset Write offs for World Trade Center Tragedy (1.0 ) Other Various Asset Impairments (6.2 ) Murray Hill Facility Impairment (6.5 ) Total Corporate and Other $ (95.5 ) $ (109.3 ) $ (78.3 ) (2) Non Operating Income (Expense) Net includes: 2001 2000 1999 Amounts in millions Gain on the Sale of the RMS Business $ 36.4 $ $ Gain on the Sale of Australia/ New Zealand Operations 17.7 Gain on the Sale of Portion of South Africa Investment 2.2 Write down of Impaired Investments (6.1 ) Litigation Gain 10.1 11.9 Total $ 50.2 $ 10.1 $ 11.9 To facilitate an analysis of D&Bs results, certain significant events should be considered, including: Impact of Blueprint for Growth Strategy (See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) In October 2000, D&B launched a new business strategy, the Blueprint for Growth, designed to transform D&B into a growth company with an important presence on the Web, while also delivering shareholder value during the transformation. The implementation of the Blueprint for Growth requires significant investments. In order to fund these investments, D&B has created a flexible business model whereby the Company has, and will continue to, identify opportunities to reallocate spending in order to invest for growth and deliver shareholder value. D&B also reviewed its non core businesses and assets with a view to converting them into cash. Financial Flexibility During the fourth quarter of 2000, D&B began the first phase of its financial flexibility program, which reduced expenses to generate approximately $130 million in annualized funds that can be reallocated for investment. In connection with this program, D&B recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $41.5 million ($30.3 million after tax, $.37 per share basic and diluted) to globalize administrative functions, streamline data collection and fulfillment, rationalize sales and marketing functions and consolidate and simplify technology functions. The pre tax charge included $28.2 million related to severance, leasehold termination obligations of $8.8 million and the write off of certain assets of $4.5 million. During the second quarter of 2001, D&B announced a second phase of its financial flexibility program that will reduce expenses to generate approximately $70 million in funds that can be reallocated for investment in 2002. Actions taken include reengineering administrative functions and instituting common business practices worldwide. The Company recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $32.8 million ($27.1 million after tax, $.34 per share basic and $.33 per share diluted) in connection with these actions. The charge included $20.7 million related to severance costs, lease termination obligations arising from office closures of 15 Table of Contents $3.2 million and the write off of certain assets of $8.9 million. Future cash funding of these obligations is anticipated to be sourced from the Companys internal cash resources. The third phase of this program, which is expected to result in a reduction of expenses to generate approximately $65 million in funds that can be reallocated in 2003, will be announced in the second quarter of 2002. Also, during the second quarter of 2001, the Company reversed $4.0 million ($3.0 million after tax, $.04 per share basic and diluted) of the 2000 restructuring charge. The Company determined that because of higher than anticipated voluntary attrition, severance for approximately 50 associates affected under phase one of the program would not be utilized. The Company also lowered its estimate of its remaining lease termination liabilities. As of December 31, 2001, D&B has terminated approximately 1,150 of the employees affected under the financial flexibility program. Since the financial flexibility initiatives began in October 2000, the total associates expected to be terminated under the program will be approximately 1,700. The Company has completed all the actions contemplated under the first phase of its financial flexibility program as of the end of 2001 and plans to complete the remainder of the actions under the second phase by June 30, 2002. During 2001, the Company also recognized the following asset write downs and impairments resulting from the implementation of the Blueprint: A $6.1 million pre tax ($3.7 million after tax, $.05 per share basic and $.04 per share diluted) write down of cost investments in the third quarter, A $6.5 million pre tax ($6.5 million after tax, $.08 per share basic and diluted) impairment write down in the fourth quarter of the Murray Hill facility, which currently serves as the Companys headquarters and which the Company is in the process of selling, and A $6.2 million pre tax ($5.6 million after tax, $.07 per share basic and diluted) loss in the fourth quarter resulting from the impairment of capitalized software and the write off of certain assets made obsolete or redundant. Monetization of Assets During 2001 D&B sold the following businesses and recognized the following non operating gains: The RMS product line was sold in the second quarter, resulting in a pre tax gain of $36.4 million ($27.8 million after tax, $.35 per share basic and $.34 per share diluted), A majority stake in the Australia/ New Zealand operations was sold in the third quarter, resulting in a pre tax gain of $17.7 million ($16.2 million after tax, $.20 per share basic and diluted), A major portion of the minority investment in the South Africa operations was sold in the fourth quarter, resulting in a pre tax gain of $2.2 million ($1.3 million after tax, $.02 per share basic and diluted). 2000 Distribution (See Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements) On September 30, 2000, the company then known as The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (Old D&B) separated into two independent, publicly traded companies The New Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (D&B or the Company) and Moodys Corporation (Moodys). The separation was accomplished through a tax free distribution to shareholders of Old D&B (the 2000 Distribution) of all of the shares of common stock of D&B. For every two shares of common stock of Old D&B held, shareholders received one share of D&B common stock. Following the 2000 Distribution, Old D&B was renamed Moodys Corporation and D&B was renamed The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. Prior to the 2000 Distribution, Old D&B had completed an internal reorganization to the effect that, at the time of the 2000 Distribution, the business of D&B consisted solely of supplying risk management, sales & marketing and supply management solutions as well as receivables management services (the D&B Business), and the business of Old D&B (other than 16 Table of Contents D&B and its subsidiaries) consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and risk management services (the Moodys Business). Due to the relative significance of the D&B Business as compared to the Moodys Business, the 2000 Distribution has been accounted for as a reverse spin off. As such, the D&B Business has been classified as continuing operations and the Moodys Business as discontinued operations. For purposes of effecting the 2000 Distribution and of governing certain continuing relationships between the Company and Moodys after the transaction, the two companies have entered into various agreements as described in Note 4 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, the consolidated financial statements of the Company have been classified to reflect the 2000 Distribution. Accordingly, revenues, costs and expenses, and cash flows of Moodys have been excluded from the respective captions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The net operating results of Moodys have been reported, net of applicable income taxes, as Income from Discontinued Operations, and the net cash flows of Moodys have been reported as Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Discontinued Operations. In 2000, the Company recognized pre tax reorganization costs of $29.5 million in operating income ($25.6 million after tax, $.32 per share basic and $.31 per share diluted). In 2001, the Company included in operating income a $7.0 million pre tax reversal of excess reorganization costs incurred in connection with the 2000 Distribution ($5.6 million after tax, $.07 per share basic and diluted). As a result of the reversal of the $7.0 million accrual, the Company reduced their receivable from Moodys by $3.5 million and made a corresponding adjustment to the stock dividend made in 2000 to Moodys. 1999 Restructuring Charge During the fourth quarter of 1999, Old D&Bs board of directors approved plans to restructure D&Bs operations. The restructuring included: (1) office consolidations and organization changes in both Europe and other international locations and improvements in sales and data collection operations in Europe, (2) realigning and streamlining D&Bs global technology organization and outsourcing certain software and product development to resources outside the United States and Europe, and (3) migrating data collection in the U.S. to telephonic data collection and closing 15 U.S. field data collection offices. As a result of these actions, a pre tax restructuring charge of $41.2 million ($27.9 million after tax, $.34 per share basic and diluted) was included in operating income in 1999, which included employee severance costs of $32.7 million. The balance of the charge related to the write off of certain assets and leasehold termination obligations. During 2001, the Company substantially completed these restructuring actions. At December 31, 2001 the remaining restructuring reserves were not significant. Other In 2001, the Company recorded in operating income a $1.0 million pre tax write off of assets lost in the World Trade Center attack ($0.6 million after tax, $.01 per share basic and diluted). In 2000, the Company recognized a $10.1 million pre tax gain ($6.2 million after tax, $.08 per share basic and diluted) and in 1999, the Company recognized an $11.9 million pre tax gain ($6.6 million after tax, $.08 per share basic and diluted) with respect to settlement of litigation matters, recorded in non operating income. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2000 For the year ended December 31, 2001, D&B reported net income of $153.2 million, or $1.93 per share basic and $1.88 per share diluted. This compares with 2000 income from continuing operations of $73.6 million and earnings per share from continuing operations of $.91 basic and $.90 diluted. With the exclusion of the transactions discussed in detail in the Overview section (included in the table on page 15), income from continuing operations would have increased 16% and earnings per share from continuing operations would 17 Table of Contents have increased 18% for basic earnings and 17% for diluted earnings. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $153.2 million. 2000 net income of $206.6 million included income from discontinued operations of $133.0 million. 2001 earnings per share were $1.93 per share basic and $1.88 per share diluted. For the year ended December 31, 2000, earnings per share of $2.55 basic and $2.52 diluted included earnings per share from discontinued operations of $1.64 basic and $1.62 diluted. Reported operating revenues, as reflected in the table on page 14, declined 8% to $1,308.8 million in 2001, compared with $1,417.6 million in 2000. Core revenues, which excludes revenues from RMS and other divested businesses, declined 1%, as revenue growth in North America of 1% was offset by declines in Europe of 3% and APLA of 1%. Before the effect of foreign exchange, core revenues increased 1% in 2001 as compared to 2000, with European revenues growing 2% and APLAs revenues growing 5% from the prior year. D&Bs results, before the effect of foreign exchange, reflect flat revenues from traditional Risk Management Solutions, offset by 11% growth in revenues from value added Risk Management Solutions such as decision support tools and services, a 1% increase in Sales & Marketing Solutions and a 3% decline in Supply Management Solutions. Operating expenses decreased 15% to $441.2 million in 2001 compared with $515.9 million in 2000, resulting from net cost savings achieved through the financial flexibility program discussed above. Included in 2001 operating expenses were a $6.2 million pre tax loss resulting from the impairment of capitalized software and the write off of certain assets made obsolete or redundant, and a $1.0 million write off of assets lost in the World Trade Center attack, as well as the $6.5 million write down of the Murray Hill facility. Excluding these items, operating expense would have decreased by 17%. Selling and administrative expenses declined 4% to $523.5 million in 2001 compared with $546.7 million in 2000. Administrative cost savings achieved through the financial flexibility program discussed above were partially offset by transition costs incurred in implementing the Blueprint for Growth strategy and planned spending in the B2B e business. Depreciation and amortization decreased 15% to $94.5 million in 2001 as compared to 2000 as a result of lower capitalized spending during the past few years and the write off of certain assets in connection with the Blueprint implementation. 2001 operating costs also included a $28.8 million charge for restructuring actions and a $7.0 million reversal of excess reorganization costs in connection with the 2000 Distribution. 2000 operating costs included a $41.5 million restructuring charge and the original $29.5 million of reorganization costs incurred with the 2000 Distribution. Operating income increased 32% in 2001 to $227.8 million from $172.8 million in 2000. Excluding the transactions in both years discussed in detail in the Overview section (included in the table on page 15), operating income would have grown 8% in 2001, as a result the financial flexibility program initiatives which reduced costs in every segment and in corporate expenses. Non operating income net was $30.0 million in 2001 compared with non operating expense net of $21.1 million in 2000. Included in non operating income (expense) net is interest income and expense, minority interest expense and other income (expense) net. Interest income of $5.5 million in 2001 was higher than 2000 interest income of $3.9 million due to higher cash levels. Interest expense increased by $7.8 million and minority interest expense decreased by $17.0 million from the prior year. This was due to the repayment of commercial paper and the Companys purchase of the $300 million minority interest obligation using proceeds from the issuance of $300 million principal amount of notes. This is discussed more fully in the Liquidity and Financial Position section below and in Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements. Other income net was $46.3 million in 2001 compared with $6.0 million in 2000. Other income net in 2001 included gains on the sales of businesses of $56.3 million offset by a write down of impaired investments of $6.1 million, as discussed in the Overview section. 2000 other income net included a gain of $10.1 million on the settlement of litigation. Excluding the items discussed in the Overview section, expenses included in other income net remained relatively constant (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements). D&Bs effective tax rate was 39.2% in 2001 compared with 51.4% in 2000. In 2000, the non deductibility of certain reorganization expenses and interest incurred had a significant impact on the effective tax rate. In addition, the underlying tax rate has continued to decline as result of state tax planning initiatives as well as global tax planning. 18 Table of Contents D&B recognized $3.5 million as equity in net losses of affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2001. These losses primarily result from the Companys investment in a joint venture with American International Group, Inc. called Avantrust LLC. Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, was $133.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, which included nine months of income from discontinued operations related to Moodys. Segment Results North America North Americas core revenues were $872.9 million in 2001, up 1% from 2000 core revenues. In comparing 2001 and 2000 revenues, North Americas revenues from Risk Management Solutions of $588.1 million were up 1%, revenues from Sales & Marketing Solutions decreased 1% to $258.4 million, and revenues from Supply Management Solutions decreased 7% to $26.4 million. The improved revenues in Risk Management Solutions reflected an increase in sales of value added products, such as D&B Risk Assessment Manager, partially offset by a decline in the traditional products, such as the Business Information Report. The decrease in revenues from Sales & Marketing Solutions and Supply Management Solutions was a result of the effects of the U.S. economic slowdown on customer spending. The effect of the slowdown was seen primarily in the Companys U.S. Sales & Marketing Solutions business, which was down 1% due to a reduction in customers direct marketing efforts. Project related marketing and purchasing solutions, which some customers may view as more discretionary in the current economy, were also affected. Total North American reported revenues, including RMS and Other Divested Businesses, was $912.3 million, a decrease of 6% from the prior year. North Americas operating income was $298.3 million in 2001, up 4% from $287.6 million in the prior year, reflecting the benefits of the Companys financial flexibility initiatives offset in part by planned investments in the B2B e business, as well as other key Blueprint initiatives. Europe Europes core revenues were $324.7 million in 2001, down 3% when compared with 2000 core revenues of $336.1 million. However, before the effect of foreign exchange, Europes core revenues would have increased 2%. Before the effect of foreign exchange, Europe would have reported in 2001 an increase in revenues from Risk Management Solutions of 1%, an increase in revenues from Sales & Marketing Solutions of 5%, and an increase in revenues from Supply Management Solutions of 70% on a relatively small base. When comparing 2001 to 2000 on a reported basis, Europes revenues from Risk Management Solutions decreased 5% to $254.5 million, revenues from Sales & Marketing Solutions decreased 1% to $66.9 million and revenues from Supply Management Solutions increased 64% to $3.3 million. Total reported revenues, including RMS and Other Divested Businesses, was $342.1 million, a decrease of 11% from the prior year. The improvement in European revenues from Risk Management Solutions reflected flat revenues from traditional products and 5% growth in revenues from value added products, before the effect of foreign exchange. Europe reported operating income of $25.2 million in 2001 as compared to an operating loss of $.9 million in 2000. The Companys financial flexibility initiatives, including a reorganization in the management of Europe from 19 separate country operations to a One Europe business model, contributed significantly to the improvement in European profitability. APLA APLA reported core revenues of $32.0 million in 2001, compared to core revenues of $32.4 million in 2000. Before the effect of foreign exchange, core revenues would have been up 5%. Before the effect of foreign exchange, APLAs revenues from Risk Management Solutions increased 6% and revenues from Sales & Marketing Solutions increased 2%. Risk Management Solutions increased due to a 3% increase in traditional products and a 31% increase in value added products, before the effect of foreign exchange. In comparing 19 Table of Contents 2001 reported results with those of 2000, APLAs revenues from Risk Management Solutions were flat at $24.7 million and revenues from Sales & Marketing Solutions decreased 4% to $7.3 million. Total reported revenues, including RMS and Other Divested Businesses, was $54.4 million, a decrease of 19% from the prior year. The reported revenues were impacted by the sale of the Australia/ New Zealand operation and the other business model changes. APLA reported an operating loss of $0.2 million in 2001, compared with an operating loss of $4.6 million in 2000. The improvement in APLAs profitability reflects the benefit of the Companys financial flexibility initiatives during the year to align investment in the region with revenue growth and profit potential. Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 1999 For the year ended December 31, 2000, D&B reported income from continuing operations of $73.6 million, or $.91 per share basic and $.90 per share diluted. This compares with 1999 income from continuing operations of $81.3 million and earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.00 basic and $.99 diluted. Excluding the impact in both years of the items discussed in the Overview section (included in the table on page 15), income from continuing operations would have increased 20% and earnings per share from continuing operations would have increased 21% for basic earnings and 20% for diluted earnings. 2000 net income of $206.6 million included income from discontinued operations of $133.0 million, while 1999 net income of $256.0 million included income from discontinued operations of $174.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2000, earnings per share of $2.55 basic and $2.52 diluted included earnings per share from discontinued operations of $1.64 basic and $1.62 diluted. For the year ended December 31, 1999, earnings per share of $3.16 basic and $3.12 diluted included earnings per share from discontinued operations of $2.16 basic and $2.13 diluted. Total operating revenues, as reflected in the table on page 14, grew 1% to $1,417.6 million in 2000, compared with $1,407.7 million in 1999. Core revenues, which excludes revenues from divested businesses, declined by 1% in 2000 to $1,236.9 million compared with $1,247.4 million in 1999. Core revenue growth in North America of 4% was offset by a decline in Europe of 9% and a decline in APLA of 15%. Before the effect of foreign exchange, core revenues increased 3% in 2000 compared to 1999, with European revenues growing 2% and APLAs revenues declining 1% from the prior year. D&Bs results, before the effect of foreign exchange, reflect flat revenues from traditional Risk Management Solutions, offset by growth in revenues from value added Risk Management Solutions such as decision support tools and services, 12% growth in Sales & Marketing Solutions and 8% growth in Supply Management Solutions. Operating expenses decreased 4% to $515.9 million in 2000 compared with $538.3 million in 1999, as a result of cost reductions attributable to the restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarters of 1999 and 2000 and the positive effect of foreign exchange on expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased by 1% to $546.7 million in 2000 compared with $539.4 million in 1999 as a result of costs incurred in order to offer new products and services, which offset cost reductions and the positive effect of foreign exchange. Depreciation and amortization decreased 13% to $111.2 million in 2000 as compared to 1999 as a result of lower capitalization over the past two years, the write off of certain assets as a result of the restructuring actions and the positive effect of foreign exchange on expenses. Operating costs in 2000 also included a $41.5 million charge for restructuring actions, while 1999 operating costs included a $41.2 million restructuring charge. In 2000, operating costs included $29.5 million in reorganization costs incurred in connection with the 2000 Distribution. Operating income increased 7% in 2000 to $172.8 million from $160.9 million in 1999. Excluding the restructuring charges in 2000 and 1999 and the reorganization costs incurred in 2000, operating income would have grown 21% in 2000 as a result of revenue growth and lower operating costs. Non operating expense net was $21.1 million in 2000 compared with $15.5 million in 1999. Included in non operating expense net is interest income and expense, minority interest expense (which remained level at $22.4 million in both 2000 and 1999) and other income net. Interest income of $3.9 million in 2000 was higher than 1999 due to higher cash levels, while interest expense of $8.6 million in 2000 was also higher than in 1999 as a result of the higher debt levels in 2000. Other income net was $6.0 million in 2000 compared with $9.0 million in 1999. Other income net for 2000 included a gain of $10.1 million on the 20 Table of Contents settlement of litigation, while 1999 other income net included a gain of $11.9 million on the settlement of litigation. These gains were offset by other miscellaneous non operating income and expense items, which were generally unchanged in 2000 and 1999. D&Bs effective tax rate was 51.4% in 2000 compared with 44.1% in 1999. The underlying tax rate was 42.0% in 2000 and 41.3% in 1999. The difference between the effective and underlying rates resulted from several factors in both 2000 and 1999, including taxes imposed on the proceeds from the settlement of litigation and the non deductibility of certain restructuring expenses. In 2000, the non deductibility of certain reorganization expenses and interest incurred also impacted the effective tax rate. Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, was $133.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $174.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. 2000 results include nine months of income from discontinued operations, while 1999 included the income from discontinued operations for a full year. Segment Results North America North America total revenues were $968.3 million in 2000, up 5% from 1999 revenues. Core revenue increased 4% to $868.4 million in 2000 from $838.2 million in 1999. In comparing 2000 and 1999 revenues, North Americas revenues from Risk Management Solutions were flat at $580.1 million, revenues from Sales & Marketing Solutions increased 13% to $259.8 million, and revenues from Supply Management Solutions increased 5% to $28.5 million. North Americas results reflect a decline in the use of traditional Risk Management Solutions products as D&B has migrated its customers from traditional Risk Management Solutions products to lower price, higher margin value added products. However, revenues from value added Risk Management Solutions products have offset the decline in traditional Risk Management Solutions products. The growth in revenues from Sales & Marketing Solutions and Supply Management Solutions was largely driven by revenues from value added products. North Americas operating income was $287.6 million in 2000, up 13% from $255.4 million in the prior year. The improvement was driven by the increase in revenues and the impact of data collection cost reductions achieved as part of the 1999 fourth quarter restructuring actions. Europe Europes total revenues were $382.1 million in 2000, down 9% when compared with 1999 revenues of $420.6 million. Core revenues were down 9% to $336.1 million in 2000 from $371.0 million in 1999. However, before the effect of foreign exchange, Europes core revenues would have been up 2%. Before the effect of foreign exchange, Europe would have reported in 2000 an increase in revenues from Risk Management Solutions of 1% and an increase in revenues from Sales & Marketing Solutions of 5% in comparison with 1999. As reported, Europes revenues from Risk Management Solutions decreased 10% to $266.4 million, revenues from Sales & Marketing Solutions decreased 6% to $67.6 million, and revenues from Supply Management Solutions increased 52% to $2.1 million, when comparing 2000 to 1999. Europe reported an operating loss of $.9 million in 2000, compared to an operating loss of $8.9 million in 1999. Europe achieved substantial improvements in profitability as a result of significant cost reductions realized from the restructuring actions announced in the fourth quarter of 1999. APLA APLA total revenues were $67.2 million in 2000, compared to revenues of $67.1 million in 1999. Core revenue decreased 15% to $32.4 million from $38.2 million in 1999. Before the effect of foreign exchange, revenues would have decreased 1%, comprised of a 9% decrease in revenues from Risk Management Solutions and an increase in revenues from Sales & Marketing Solutions of 48%, in each case in comparison with 1999. In comparing 2000 reported results with those of 1999, APLAs revenues from Risk Management Solutions decreased 23% to $24.8 million and revenues from Sales & Marketing Solutions increased 29% to $7.6 million. 21 Table of Contents APLA reported an operating loss of $4.6 million in 2000, compared with an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. The decrease in operating losses was due to cost reductions and the changes in the business model. Recently Issued Accounting Standards On October 3, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (SFAS No. 144), Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. SFAS No. 144, however, retains the fundamental provisions of SFAS No. 121 for (a) recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and (b) measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. SFAS No. 144 supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30 (Opinion 30), Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, for segments of a business to be disposed of. SFAS No. 144, however, retains the requirement of Opinion 30 to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of (by sale, by abandonment, or in a distribution to owners) or is classified as held for sale. SFAS No. 144 also amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a temporarily controlled subsidiary. The provisions of SFAS No. 144 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 144 beginning January 1, 2002. The Company believes there will be no material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial position upon adoption of SFAS No. 144. On July 20, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (SFAS No. 141), Business Combinations, and No. 142 (SFAS No. 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination at acquisition. SFAS No. 141 requires the purchase method of accounting to be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 141 supersedes APB Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 38, Accounting for Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises. SFAS No. 141 establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill and requires unallocated negative goodwill to be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain (instead of being deferred and amortized). SFAS No. 141 is effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and for all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is after June 30, 2001, and has been adopted by the Company since that date. SFAS No. 142 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets (but not those acquired in a business combination) at acquisition. SFAS No. 142 also addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. Under the new rules, the Company is no longer required to amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives but will be subject to periodic testing for impairment. It also provides that intangible assets that have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives, but those lives will no longer be limited to 40 years. SFAS No. 142 supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets. D&B considers its operating segments, North America, Europe and APLA, as its reporting units under the definitions of SFAS No. 142 for consideration of potential impairment of intangible and goodwill balances. Based upon the Companys preliminary assessment, it does not expect to recognize any impairment of the existing assets upon adoption. The provisions of SFAS No. 142 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 142 beginning January 1, 2002. As a result of adoption of SFAS No. 142, a substantial amount of the Companys goodwill assets will no longer be amortized, resulting in a $5 million reduction in amortization expense in 2002. 22 Table of Contents Market Risk The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of certain of its investments. Policies and procedures In the normal course of business, D&B employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies. In 2001, the Companys use of derivatives was limited to the use of short term foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge short term foreign exchange denominated loans, and interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure on the fixed rate bond. The Companys objective in managing exposure to interest rates is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, cash flows and financial position, and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, the Company maintains a policy that floating rate debt be managed within a minimum and maximum range of the Companys total debt exposure as established by policy. To achieve the policy objectives, the Company may use fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and or interest rate swaps. D&Bs objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings, cash flow and financial position volatility in its European and APLA operations. D&B follows a policy of hedging substantially all cross border intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of its various subsidiaries. D&B only uses short term foreign exchange forward contracts to implement its hedging strategy. Typically, these contracts have maturities of six months or less. These forward contracts are executed with creditworthy institutions and are denominated primarily in the British pound sterling, the euro and the Swedish krona. A discussion of D&Bs accounting policies for financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest Rate Risk In 2001, D&B purchased the third party fixed rate minority interest obligation by issuing a five year, fixed rate bond that matures in March 2006 (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). D&B also entered into fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements in the third quarter of 2001 with notional principal amounts totaling $100 million (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements), and designated these swaps as fair value hedges against a portion of the long term fixed rate bonds. The arrangement is considered a highly effective hedge, and there is no impact on earnings. The swaps and hedged portion of the bonds are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value. The swaps are considered highly effective hedges, with changes in fair value of the swaps offsetting the impact on earnings of changes in the fair value of the hedged bonds. At December 31, 2001 the Company had no floating rate debt outstanding. Foreign Exchange Risk D&B operates in 30 countries through wholly owned entities and in eight countries through minority interests in joint ventures, and principally uses the capital markets to fund its operations. D&Bs non U.S. operations generated approximately 32% of total revenues in 2001. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 35% of D&Bs assets were located outside the U.S., and no single country outside the U.S. had a significant concentration of D&Bs aggregate cash balances. As in prior years, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to offset the earnings impact of transaction gains or losses resulting from foreign currency denominated inter company loans. The underlying loans and the corresponding forward contracts are marked to market at each quarter end, are fully disclosed within the financial statements and have a minimal impact on earnings. The fair value of the foreign currency risk is estimated by calculating the cost of closing out all foreign exchange contracts given a 10% increase or decrease in forward rates from their December 31, 2001 levels. At December 31, 2001, D&B had approximately $259 million in foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding 23 Table of Contents with net losses of $.9 million. If forward rates were to increase 10% from year end levels, the net gain would be $4.4 million. If forward rates were to decrease 10% from year end levels, the net loss would be $5.3 million. However, the estimated potential gain or loss on these contracts is expected to be offset by changes in the dollar value of the underlying transactions. Therefore, the net effect of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates would have a minimal impact on earnings. Other Risks (See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements) Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, principally through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. It is possible that additional liabilities may be proposed by tax authorities as a result of these reviews and that some of the reviews could be resolved unfavorably. At this time, management is unable to predict the extent of such reviews, their outcome or whether the resolution of these matters could materially affect D&Bs results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Pursuant to the 2000 Distribution Agreement (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), D&B and Moodys each agreed to be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise with respect to the reviews described above, to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and Old D&B responded by filing a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on September 21, 2000. Pursuant to a series of agreements, IMS Health and Nielsen Media Research are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and Donnelley the other half, of any payments for taxes and accrued interest arising from this matter and certain other potential tax liabilities after Donnelley pays the first $137 million. In connection with the 1998 Distribution, Old D&B and Donnelley entered into an agreement whereby Old D&B assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley arising from these tax matters and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old D&B paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000, which Old D&B funded with short term borrowings. IMS Health has informed D&B that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing. Notwithstanding the filing and payment, D&B is contesting the IRSs formal assessment and will also contest the assessment of amounts, if any, in excess of the amounts paid. D&B has accrued its anticipated share of the probable liability arising from the utilization of these capital losses. D&B and its subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of D&B in connection with such matters will not have a material effect on D&Bs operating results, cash flows or financial position. Liquidity and Financial Position Management believes that cash flows generated from its operations and supplemented as needed with readily available financing arrangements are sufficient to meet the short term and long term needs of D&B. D&B accesses the commercial paper market from time to time to fund working capital needs and share repurchases. Such borrowings have been supported by D&Bs bank credit facilities. 24 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2000 At December 31, 2001, cash and cash equivalents totaled $145.3 million, an increase from $70.1 million at December 31, 2000. During 2001, the Companys cash flow was impacted by: The $100 million share repurchase program, with 3.2 million shares of common stock repurchased as of December 31, 2001. The sale of the RMS business with cash proceeds of $125 million, which included $90 million for the business and $35 million related to an exclusive contract to provide the buyers with risk management products over five years. The amount related to the contract was recorded in deferred revenue and will be recognized as income as the services are rendered. The sale of the Australia/ New Zealand and South Africa operations with cash proceeds of $29 million. The acquisitions of iMarket and Harris InfoSource International, Inc. for which the Company paid a total of $34.5 million. In 2000, D&Bs payment of $349.3 million to the IRS and the impact of the 2000 Distribution with respect to the allocation of net indebtedness impacted the cash balance. Cash generated by operating activities Cash generated by operating activities in 2001 was $217.1 million. The improvement in cash generated by operating activities of continuing operations when comparing 2001 with 2000, excluding the payment to the IRS, results from increased operating income and lower net interest expense, offset by higher restructuring payments in the current year. During 2001, D&B made payments of $26.9 million related to restructuring actions under the Blueprint for Growth and $13.7 million which completed the payments for the 1999 restructuring actions. In 2000, the Company made payments of $21.8 million for restructuring actions. Operating activities in 2000 provided net cash of $27.2 million during 2000. The $349.3 million payment to the IRS, discussed in Other Risks above, in 2000 is reflected as a reduction in continuing operations accrued income taxes of $174.7 million and as a $174.6 million offset to net cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations. Excluding the impact of the payment, cash generated by operating activities in 2000 would have been $376.5 million, with continuing operations providing $206.0 million and discontinued operations providing $170.5 million (representing nine months of activity). Cash provided by investing activities Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $35.2 million in 2001, compared with net cash used in investing activities of $81.7 million in 2000. Cash proceeds from the sale of businesses of $118.2 million, consisting of the proceeds from the sales of the RMS businesses, the majority stake in the Australia/ New Zealand operations, and a major portion of minority investment in South Africa. Payments for acquisitions were $34.5 million. In 2001, D&B spent $53.2 million on capital expenditures, computer software and other intangibles. In 2000, spending for capital expenditures, computer software and other intangibles by continuing operations totaled $67.1 million. During 2001, the Company invested $11.3 million in a joint venture with American International Group, Inc. called Avantrust LLC. In 2000, D&B invested $6.0 million in other unconsolidated affiliates. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in 2000 was $26.2 million. Net cash used by discontinued operations in 2000 included an acquisition by Moodys of a financial software products company for $17.4 million. Cash used in financing activities Net cash used in financing activities was $177.4 million in 2001, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $18.8 million during 2000. Excluding the $195.5 million net cash provided by discontinued operations in 2000, net cash used in financing activities would have been $176.7 million. D&B did not pay dividends in 2001 and does not intend to pay dividends in the future. Payments of dividends by Old D&B accounted for $89.8 million in 2000. 25 Table of Contents In the first quarter of 2001, the Company issued $300 million in principal of notes in a private placement. During the second quarter of 2001, the Company exchanged these notes for freely tradeable notes with identical terms. The notes have a five year term and bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.625%, payable semi annually. The cash proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used to repay a $300 million obligation resulting from the purchase of an unrelated partners interest in a limited partnership. In September 2001, D&B renewed a $175 million committed bank facility. The facility matures in September 2002 and is expected to be renewed at or before that time. The Company also maintains a second facility permitting borrowings of up to an additional $175 million that matures in September 2005. Under these facilities D&B has the ability to borrow at prevailing short term interest rates. D&B has not drawn on those facilities since their inception and had no borrowings outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2001. These facilities are available for general corporate purposes, including support of D&Bs commercial paper program. The Company is in compliance with all covenants or other requirements set forth in its credit agreements and indentures. At December 31, 2001, D&B had no commercial paper outstanding. The $49.5 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2000 was repaid in full during 2001. D&B repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock for $44.9 million in 2001 in connection with its Employee Stock Purchase Plan and to offset a portion of the shares issued under stock incentive plans. Net proceeds from D&B stock plans totaled $19.0 million in 2001. Between January 1, 2000 and September 30, 2000, Old D&B repurchased 125,000 shares of common stock for $3.5 million in connection with its Employee Stock Purchase Plan and to offset a portion of the shares issued under stock incentive plans. During the fourth quarter of 2000, D&B repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for $43.3 million to offset awards under stock incentive plans and in connection with the D&B Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Proceeds received in connection with Old D&Bs stock plans were $30.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000. D&B received proceeds in connection with D&Bs stock plans of $7.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2000. Future liquidity requirements and other commitments In January 2002, the Company acquired an additional 2.5 million shares, in a privately negotiated block trade, for $85.1 million, funded with cash on hand and $36.0 million of short term commercial paper borrowings. During the course of 2001, D&B invested in a joint venture with American International Group, Inc. called Avantrust LLC. The Company has committed to invest approximately $8 million more in Avantrust LLC. Certain of the Companys operations are conducted from leased facilities, which are under operating leases that expire over the next 10 years, with the majority expiring within five years. The Company also leases certain computer and other equipment under operating leases that expire over the next three years. These leases are frequently renegotiated or otherwise changed as advancements in computer technology produce opportunities to lower costs and improve performance. Additionally, the Company has agreements with various third parties to purchase certain data processing and telecommunication services extending beyond one year. See Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements for a schedule of future minimum lease payments under non cancelable leases. The Companys debt obligation of $300 million is repayable in March 2006. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. New European Currency On January 1, 2002, 12 of the countries in the European Union completed the three year transition to a single European currency, the euro, which replaced the national currency of each participating country. Early in the transition period, the Company established a task force to address issues related to the euro. The 26 Table of Contents Company believed that the euro conversion might have a material impact on its operations and financial condition if it failed to successfully address such issues. The task force followed a project plan which included the following: ensuring that the Companys information technology systems that process data for inclusion in the Companys products and services could appropriately handle amounts denominated in euro contained in data provided to the Company by third party data suppliers; modification of the Companys products and services to deal with euro related issues; and modification of the Companys internal systems (such as payroll, accounting and financial reporting) to deal with euro related issues. All targets within the project plan have been met. All D&B information products which contain financial data on businesses in euro participating countries now use the new currency. The cost of the modifications covered by the project plan have not had a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. There is no guarantee that all problems have been foreseen and corrected, or that no material disruption of the Companys business will occur. The conversion to the euro may have competitive implications for the Companys pricing and marketing strategies, which could be material in nature. However, any such impact is not known at this time. Dividends D&B paid a quarterly dividend of $.185 per share in the first three quarters of 2000, resulting in a full year dividend per share paid of $.555 for 2000. D&B did not pay dividends in 2001 and does not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Forward Looking Statements Certain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking statements. Statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, words such as expects, anticipates, believes, plans, guidance and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. All such forward looking statements are made based on D&Bs reasonable expectations at the time they are made. However, forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and that may cause D&Bs actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in such forward looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may affect D&Bs performance include: (1) the possibility that economic or other conditions might lead to a reduction in the demand for D&B products and services worldwide, (2) the possibility that the current economic slowdown may worsen and or persist for an unpredictable period of time, (3) D&Bs ability to successfully implement its Blueprint for Growth, including the ability to achieve its financial flexibility objectives on terms and conditions contemplated by D&B, (4) changes in the business information and risk management industries and markets, including changes in customers preferences for products and product delivery formats resulting from advances in information technology, (5) competitive pressures causing price reductions and or loss of market share, (6) risks associated with investments and operations in foreign countries, including foreign economic conditions, exchange rate fluctuations, regulatory environment, and cultural factors, (7) D&Bs ability to successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions, alliances and investments, (8) D&Bs ability to protect proprietary information and technology or to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, (9) the potential loss of key business assets, including data center capacity, or interruption of telecommunication links or power sources, (10) changes in the legislative, regulatory and commercial environments affecting D&Bs ability to collect, manage, aggregate and use data, (11) D&Bs ability to attract and retain key employees, and (12) the competitive implications that the conversion to the euro may have on D&Bs pricing and marketing strategies. D&B undertakes no obligations to update any forward looking statements to reflect any future events or circumstances. The more prominent risks and uncertainties inherent in our businesses are described in more detail below. However, these are not the only risks and uncertainties that D&B faces. Our businesses may face additional risks and uncertainties that are unknown to D&B at this time. 27 Table of Contents Economic or other conditions might lead to a reduction in the demand for D&Bs products and services worldwide. The current economic slowdown may worsen and or persist for an unpredictable period of time. Demand for many of D&Bs products and services is influenced by economic trends. As a result, downturns in the United States economy or in the global economy may cause decreased demand for D&Bs products and services. A decline in the demand for our products and services could have an adverse effect on D&Bs revenues, results of operations and financial condition. As a result of the current economic climate, D&B has experienced a reduction in the demand for certain of its marketing products and services as customers have looked for ways to reduce their expenses. The current economic slowdown may worsen and or persist for an unpredictable period of time. If D&B is unable to successfully control its own expenses, it could suffer lower net income and earnings per share. D&B may be unable to successfully implement the Blueprint for Growth, including the ability to achieve its financial flexibility objectives on the terms and conditions contemplated. In 2000 D&B adopted its Blueprint for Growth strategy which involves significant investments, reallocating spending, and becoming an important player in B2B e business. To execute this strategy, D&B announced two phases of a financial flexibility program intended to reduce expenses to generate approximately $200 million annually. If D&B is unable to generate the expected savings from the financial flexibility program on the terms and conditions contemplated, its ability to implement the investments contemplated by its strategy may be adversely affected. The inability to achieve the financial flexibility objectives on the terms and conditions contemplated or the failure to successfully implement the other programs under the Blueprint for Growth could have an adverse effect on D&Bs revenues, results of operations and financial condition. D&B may be unable to successfully adapt to changes in the business information and risk management industries and markets, including changes in customer preferences for products and product delivery formats resulting from advances in information technology. D&B provides information and services to its customers in a variety of formats, including printed formats, electronic formats, and over the internet. Advances in information technology may result in changing customer preferences for products and product delivery formats. If it does not successfully adapt its products and services to take advantage of changes in technology and customer preferences, D&Bs business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. D&B adopted an internet strategy because it believes that the internet represents an important and rapidly evolving market for marketing information products and services. Because its B2B strategy is in the early stages of development and involves systems integration with its customers, D&B does not know if this strategy will be successful. D&Bs business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected if it: Fails to develop products and services that are well suited to the internet market; Experiences difficulties that delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these products and services; or Fails to achieve sufficient traffic to its internet sites to generate significant revenues, or to successfully implement e business operations. D&B faces competition that may cause price reductions and or loss of market share. All of D&Bs businesses are highly competitive. D&B competes directly with a broad range of companies offering business information services to business customers. In addition, business information and related products and services are becoming increasingly available, principally as a result of the expansion of the internet and as new providers of B2B information products and services emerge. In its information services businesses, D&B also faces competition from in house operations of the businesses it seeks as customers, from other general and specialized credit reporting and other business information services, other information and 28 Table of Contents professional services providers, banks, credit insurers and the internet. Intense competition could harm D&B by causing, among other things, price reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. There are risks associated with investments and operations in foreign countries, including foreign economic conditions, exchange rate fluctuations, the regulatory environment, and cultural factors. D&B conducts business outside of the United States. As a result, its operating results could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond its control. These factors include regulatory, political or economic conditions in a specific country or region, trade protection measures, and other regulatory requirements. Although foreign currency translation gains and losses are not currently material to D&Bs consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, an increase in foreign revenues could subject D&B to foreign currency translation risks in the future. Additional risks inherent in its non U.S. business activities generally include, among others, potentially longer accounts receivable payment cycles, the costs of and difficulties in managing international operations, potentially adverse tax consequences, and greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights. D&B may lose key business assets, including loss of data center capacity, or the interruption of telecommunication links or power sources. D&Bs ability to protect its data centers against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other disasters is critical to its future. The on line services D&B provides are dependent on links to telecommunication providers. D&B believes it has taken reasonable precautions to protect its data centers and telecommunication links from events that could interrupt operations. Nonetheless, any damage to D&Bs data centers or any failure of its telecommunications links that causes interruptions in operations could materially adversely affect its ability to meet customers requirements, which could result in decreased revenues, net income, and earnings per share. Changes in the legislative, regulatory and commercial environments may adversely affect D&Bs ability to collect, manage, aggregate and use data. Certain data and services provided by D&B are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the United States as well as those in Canada, Europe and certain countries within the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions. In addition, there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public regarding marketing and privacy concerns, particularly as they relate to the internet. This concern is likely to result in new laws and regulations. Compliance with existing federal, state and local laws and regulations has not to date seriously affected its business, financial condition or results of operations. Nonetheless, future international, federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to the collection, management and use of data and adverse publicity or potential litigation concerning the commercial use of such information may increasingly affect D&Bs operations. This could result in substantial regulatory compliance or litigation expense or a loss of revenue. Data suppliers might withdraw data from D&B, leading to an inability to provide products and services. Much of the data that D&B uses is obtained from third parties, including public record sources. D&B could suffer a material adverse effect if owners of the data it uses were to withdraw the data. Data providers could withdraw their data from D&B if there is a competitive reason to do so or if legislation is passed restricting the use of the data. If a substantial number of data providers were to withdraw their data, D&Bs ability to provide products and services to its customers could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenues, net income and earnings per share.
