Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations How We Manage Our Business For internal management purposes, we refer to core revenue, which we calculate as total operating revenue less the revenue of divested businesses. Core revenue is used to manage and evaluate the performance of our business segments and to allocate resources because this measure provides an indication of the underlying changes in revenue in a single performance measure. Core revenue does not include reported revenue of divested businesses since they are not included in future revenue. Divested business revenue included in our financial results is as follows: The Nordic region (Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland, all sold in the first quarter of 2004); India and other Distribution Channels in Pakistan and the Middle East (sold in the first quarter of 2004); Central Europe (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, all sold in the second quarter of 2004); Iberia (Spain and Portugal, both sold in the fourth quarter of 2004); and France (sold in the fourth quarter of 2004). These divested businesses have been classified as Divestitures in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Management believes that the measure of core revenue provides valuable insight into our revenue from ongoing operations and enables investors to evaluate business performance and trends by facilitating a comparison of results of ongoing operations with past reports of financial results. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were no divestitures. We also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because we believe it is useful for investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another, both with and without the effects of foreign exchange. As a result, we monitor our core revenue growth both after and before the effects of foreign exchange. Core revenue growth excluding the effects of foreign exchange is referred to as revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange. We further analyze core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange among two components, organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions. We analyze organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions because management believes this information provides an important insight into the underlying health of our business. Core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we analyze core revenue both before and after the results of our Italian real estate data business because of the 22 Table of Contents distortion of comparability of results due to significant price increases in response to legislative changes and the uncertainty of other regulatory changes. Management believes this information provides an important insight into the underlying health of our business. We evaluate the performance of our business segments based on segment revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange, and segment operating income growth before certain types of gains and charges that we consider do not reflect our underlying business performance. Specifically, for management reporting purposes, we evaluate business segment performance before non core gains and charges because such charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations. A recurring component of non core gains and charges are our restructuring charges, which result from a foundational element of our growth strategy that we refer to as Financial Flexibility. Through Financial Flexibility, management identifies opportunities to improve the performance of the business in terms of quality, efficiency and cost, in order to generate savings primarily to invest for growth. Such charges are variable from period to period based upon actions identified and taken during each period. Management reviews operating results before such charges on a monthly basis and establishes internal budgets and forecasts based upon such measures. Management further establishes annual and long term compensation such as salaries, target cash bonuses and target equity compensation amounts based on such measures and a significant percentage weight is placed upon such measures in determining whether performance objectives have been achieved. Management believes that by eliminating restructuring charges from such financial measures, and by being overt to shareholders about the results of our operations excluding such charges, business leaders are provided incentives to recommend and execute actions that are in the best long term interests of our shareholders, rather than being influenced by the potential impact a charge in a particular period could have on their compensation. Additionally, transition costs (period costs such as consulting fees, costs of temporary employees, relocation costs and stay bonuses incurred to implement the Financial Flexibility component of our strategy) are reported as Corporate and Other expenses and are not allocated to our business segments. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for financial information regarding our segments. Similarly, when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole, we focus on results (such as operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, net income, tax rate and diluted earnings per share) before non core gains and charges because such non core gains and charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations and may drive behavior that does not ultimately maximize shareholder value. It should not be concluded from our presentation of non core gains and charges that the items that result in non core gains and charges will not occur in the future. We also use free cash flow to manage our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles. Free cash flow measures our available cash flow for potential debt repayment, acquisitions, stock repurchases and additions to cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. We believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating the funding available after supporting our ongoing business operations and our portfolio of product investments. Free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute measure for, or superior to, net cash flows provided by operating activities, investing activities or financing activities. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our consolidated statements of cash flows. The adjustments discussed herein to our results as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods, to allocate resources, to evaluate business performance and, as noted above, for compensation purposes. However, these financial measures (results before non core gains and charges and free cash flow) are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a 23 Table of Contents substitute for total revenue, operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, net income, tax rate, diluted earnings per share, or net cash provided by operating activities, investing activities and financing activities prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, it should be noted that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly or at all, the presentation of these financial measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies. See Results of Operations, below, for a discussion of our results reported on a GAAP basis. Overview On January 1, 2005, we began managing and reporting our operations in Canada as part of our International segment. As part of this change, our results are reported under the following two segments: United States (U.S.); and International (which consists of operations in Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific and Latin America). The financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. and Canada reflect a fiscal year ended November 30 to facilitate timely reporting of our consolidated financial results and financial position. Prior to January 1, 2005, we reported our business through the following segments: North America (which consisted of operations in the U.S. and Canada); and International (which consisted of operations in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America). In accordance with GAAP, throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we have reclassified prior period presentations to conform to our current segment reporting. The following table presents the contribution by segment to core revenue and total revenue: For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2006 2005 2004 Core Revenue: U.S. 76 % 75 % 75 % International 24 % 25 % 25 % Total Revenue: U.S. 76 % 75 % 71 % International 24 % 25 % 29 % The following table presents the contribution by customer solution set to core revenue and total revenue: For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2006 2005 2004 Core Revenue: Risk Management Solutions 64 % 66 % 66 % Sales & Marketing Solutions 27 % 27 % 28 % E Business Solutions 6 % 4 % 3 % Supply Management Solutions 3 % 3 % 3 % Total Revenue(1): Risk Management Solutions 64 % 66 % 62 % Sales & Marketing Solutions 27 % 27 % 26 % E Business Solutions 6 % 4 % 4 % Supply Management Solutions 3 % 3 % 2 % (1) Divested businesses contributed 6% of our total revenue for the year December 31, 2004.

Financial Flexibility is an ongoing process by which we seek to reallocate our spending from low growth or low value activities to other activities that will create greater value for shareholders through enhanced revenue growth, improved profitability and or quality improvements. With each program we have incurred restructuring charges (which generally consists of employee severance and termination costs, contract terminations, asset write offs, and or costs to terminate lease obligations, less assumed sublease income) and transition costs (which consist of other costs necessary to accomplish the process changes such as consulting fees, costs of temporary workers, relocation costs and stay bonuses). On January 9, 2007, we announced our 2007 Financial Flexibility Program. Our 2007 Financial Flexibility Program is designed to significantly reduce the complexity of our business. This program will create financial flexibility through several initiatives, including the following: Organizational Design: this initiative is intended to improve the efficiency of how we are organized and how we operate as a business by addressing spans of control, organizational layers and the effectiveness of leadership processes; Product and Technology Complexity: this initiative is intended to simplify our product and technology environment by reducing product complexity and proliferation as well as eliminating and consolidating systems and technology infrastructure; Sales Force Effectiveness: this initiative is intended to improve our sales force tools, reduce the non selling time of our sales force and enhance our new customer acquisition activities; and Other Efficiency Measures: this initiative is intended to improve the operating efficiencies of our facilities, reduce our purchasing costs and simplify our data collection and product delivery. We expect to complete all actions under the 2007 program by December 2007. On an annualized basis, these actions are expected to create $80 million to $85 million of financial flexibility, of which approximately $60 million to $65 million will be generated in 2007, before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of savings generated by the initiatives. To implement these initiatives, we expect to incur transition costs of approximately $13 million to $15 million. In addition, we expect to incur restructuring charges, totaling $30 million to $35 million pre tax, of which $27 million to $32 million relate to severance, approximately $1 million relates to lease termination obligations and approximately $2 million relate to other exit costs in 2007. Approximately $42 million to $49 million of these transition costs and restructuring charges are expected to result in cash expenditures. As a result of this reengineering program, we expect that approximately 400 positions will be eliminated globally. Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In preparing our consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances reflected therein, we have applied the significant accounting policies described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Of those policies, we consider the policies described below to be critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require managements subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If actual results in a given period ultimately differ from previous estimates, the actual results could have a material impact on such period. 26 Table of Contents We have discussed the selection and application of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure regarding critical accounting policies and estimates as well as the other sections in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations We offer substantially all of our U.S. based employees coverage under a defined benefit plan called The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation Retirement Account (the U.S. Qualified Plan). The U.S. Qualified Plan covers active and retired employees including retired individuals from spin off companies (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further discussion of spin off companies). Pension costs are determined actuarially and funded in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. We also maintain supplemental and excess plans in the United States (the U.S. Non Qualified Plans) to provide additional retirement benefits to certain key employees. These plans are unfunded, pay as you go plans. The U.S. Qualified Plan and the U.S. Non Qualified Plans account for approximately 69% and 14% of our pension obligations, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Our employees in certain of our international operations are also provided retirement benefits through defined benefit plans representing the remaining balance of our pension obligations. In addition to providing pension benefits, we provide various health care and life insurance benefits for retirees. U.S. based employees, who retire with 10 years of vesting service after age 45, are eligible to receive benefits. Postretirement benefit costs and obligations are determined actuarially. In accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, amended by SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, our pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial assumptions and methodologies. Other postretirement benefits (i.e., health care) are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, amended by SFAS No. 158, and are also dependent on the application of our assumptions by outside actuaries. The key assumptions used in the measurement of the pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement cost are: Expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets which is based on a target asset allocation as well as expected returns on asset categories of plan investments; Discount rate which is used to measure the present value of pension plan obligations and postretirement health care obligations. The discount rates are derived using a yield curve approach which matches projected plan benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans; Rates of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation/conversion rates which are based on an evaluation of internal plans and external market indicators; and Health care cost trends which are based on historical cost data, the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends. We believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, though changes in these assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The factor with the most immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements is a change in the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets for the U.S. Qualified Plan. For 2007, we will continue to use an expected long term rate of return of 8.25%. This assumption was 8.25%, 8.50% and 8.75% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 8.25% assumption represents our best estimate of the expected long term future investment performance of the U.S. Qualified Plan, after considering expectations for future capital market returns and the plans asset allocation. As of December 31, 2006, the plan was 65% invested in publicly traded equity securities, 28% invested in debt securities and 7% invested in real 27 Table of Contents estate investments. Every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the long term rate of return increases or reduces our annual operating income by approximately $3.2 million by increasing or reducing our net periodic pension income. Changes in the discount rate, rate of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation/conversion rates also have an effect on our annual operating income. Based on the factors noted above, the discount rate is adjusted at each remeasurement date while other assumptions are reviewed annually. For our U.S. plans and Postretirement Benefit Plan, every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our pension cost and postretirement cost by approximately $4.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, for all of our U.S. pension plans and our Postretirement Benefit Plan, we increased the discount rate to 5.84% and 5.64% from 5.50% and 5.30% used at December 31, 2005, respectively. Differences between the assumptions stated above and actual experience could affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise in accordance with SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106, as amended by SFAS No. 158. These gains and losses are aggregated and amortized generally over the average future service periods of employees to the extent that such gains or losses exceed a corridor as defined in SFAS No. 87. The purpose of the corridor is to reduce the volatility caused by the difference between actual experience and the pension related assumptions noted above, on a plan by plan basis. For all of our pension plans, total actuarial losses that have not been recognized in our pension costs as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $503.8 million and $597.0 million, respectively, of which $274.5 million and $392.7 million, respectively, were attributable to the U.S. Qualified Plan, $98.1 million and $114.0 million, respectively, were attributable to the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, and the remainder was attributable to the non U.S. pension plans. (See discussion in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.) We expect to recognize a portion of such losses in our 2007 net periodic pension cost of approximately $17.6 million, $5.7 million and $3.7 million, for the U.S. Qualified Plan, U.S. Non Qualified Plans and non U.S. plans, respectively, compared to $22.4 million, $6.8 million and $2.3 million, respectively, in 2006. The lower amortization of actuarial loss in 2007 of $4.8 million and $1.1 million related to the U.S. Qualified Plan and the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, respectively, which will be included in our pension cost in 2007, is primarily due to lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses exceeding the corridor threshold under SFAS No. 87 at January 1, 2007, primarily resulting from a higher discount rate and better 2006 plan asset performance. The higher amortization of actuarial loss of $1.4 million in 2007 related to our non U.S. plans is primarily due to higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses as a result of adopting new mortality tables and a lower discount rate at January 1, 2007. Differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could affect our net periodic pension cost. We recorded net periodic cost for our pension plans of $27.0 million and $13.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and net periodic pension income of $11.7 million for 2004. A major component of the net periodic pension cost is the expected return on plan assets, which was $113.5 million, $119.2 million and $126.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The expected return on plan assets was determined by multiplying the expected long term rate of return assumption by the market related value of plan assets. The market related value of plan assets recognizes asset gains and losses over five years to reduce the effects of short term market fluctuations on net periodic cost. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recorded investment gains of $175.5 million, $112.6 million and $128.0 million, respectively, in our pension plans, of which $157.1 million, $90.2 million and $116.2 million, respectively, were attributable to the U.S. Qualified Plan and $18.4 million, $22.4 million and $11.8 million, respectively, were attributable to the non U.S. plans. At January 1, 2007, the market related value of plan assets of our U.S. Qualified Plan and the non U.S. plans was $1,296.0 million and $171.3 million, respectively, compared with the fair value of its plan assets of $1,349.5 million and $185.2 million, respectively. Changes in the funded status of our pension plans could result in fluctuation in our shareholders equity. We adopted SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006 and we are required to recognize the funded status of our benefit plans as a liability or an asset, on a plan by plan basis, with an offsetting adjustment to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, or AOCI, in shareholders equity, net of tax. Accordingly, the amounts 28 Table of Contents recognized in equity represent unrecognized gains/losses and prior service costs. We recognized charges of $182.7 million, net of applicable deferred taxes, to our shareholders equity in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 158. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs included in the shareholders equity would be amortized out of equity based on an actuarial calculation each period. Gains and losses and prior service costs that arise during the year will be recognized as a component of AOCI. A change in the discount rate assumption could result in a change in the funded status of our benefit plans by changing the amount of the benefit obligation. For the U.S. Qualified Plan, every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our projected benefit obligation by approximately $40.9 million. For the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our projected benefit obligation by approximately $7.6 million. For information on pension and postretirement benefit plan contribution requirements, please see Future Liquidity Sources and Uses of Funds Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefit Plan Contribution Requirements. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for more information regarding costs of, and assumptions for, our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs. Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation programs are described more fully in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payments, or SFAS No. 123R, which revises SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, or APB No. 25, using the Modified Prospective method. Under the Modified Prospective method, compensation cost associated with the stock option programs recognized for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes (a) compensation cost for stock options granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for stock options granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value under SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R also requires us to estimate future forfeitures in calculating the expense relating to stock based compensation as opposed to only recognizing these forfeitures and the corresponding reductions in expense as they occur. As a result, we have adjusted for this cumulative effect and recognized a pre tax reduction in stock based compensation of $0.5 million related to our restricted stock and restricted stock unit programs during the first quarter of 2006. As required under the Modified Prospective method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we applied APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for our plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized for grants under the stock option programs and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) prior to January 1, 2006. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option valuation model. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility rate of our common stock. Beginning in 2006, the expected term was determined using the simplified method for estimating the expected option life, as prescribed under Staff Accounting Bulletin or SAB No. 107, Share Based Payments, or SAB No. 107. Prior to 2006, the expected term was estimated using historical patterns and managements judgment. The risk free interest rate for the corresponding expected term of the stock option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. We estimate the amount of stock based awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting. For stock options granted prior to SFAS No. 123R, the compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. For stock options granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the 29 Table of Contents shorter of the vesting period or the period from the grant date to the date when retirement eligibility is achieved. If factors change we may decide to use different assumptions under the Black Scholes option valuation model in the future, which could materially affect our share based compensation expense, operating income, net income and earnings per share. Contingencies and Litigation We establish reserves in connection with tax and legal proceedings, claims and litigation when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time. Estimating probable losses requires analyses of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments concerning potential actions by third parties and regulators. This is an inherently subjective and complex process, and actual results may differ from our estimates by material amounts. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Revenue Recognition Our Risk Management Solutions are generally sold under monthly or annual contracts that enable a customer to purchase our information solutions during the period of contract at prices per an agreed price list, up to the contracted dollar limit. Revenue on these contracts is recognized as solutions are delivered to the customer, based on the per solution price. Any additional solutions purchased over this limit may be subject to pricing variations and revenue is recognized as the solutions are delivered. If customers do not use the full value of their contract and forfeit the unused portion, we recognize the forfeited amount as revenue at contract expiration. We also have fixed price subscription contracts for customers that allow those customers unlimited use within predefined ranges, subject to certain conditions. In these instances, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract, which is generally one year. Revenue related to services provided over the contract term, such as monitoring services, is recognized ratably over the contract period, which is typically one year. For Sales & Marketing Solutions and Supply Management Solutions, we generally recognize revenue upon delivery of the information file to the customer. For arrangements that include periodic updates to that information file over the contract term, the portion of the revenue related to updates expected to be delivered is deferred as a liability on the balance sheet and recognized as the updates are delivered, usually on a quarterly or monthly basis. For subscription solutions that provide continuous access to our generic marketing information and business reference databases, as well as any access fees or hosting fees related to enabling customers access to our information, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically one year. We have certain solution offerings that are sold as multi element arrangements. The multiple elements may include information files, file updates for certain solutions, software, services, trademarks and or other intangibles. Revenue for each element is recognized when that element is delivered to the customer, based upon the relative fair value for each element. For offerings that include software that is considered to be more than incidental, we recognize revenue when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed and the software has been shipped and installed. Maintenance revenue, which consists of fees for ongoing support and software updates, is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically one year, when the maintenance for the software is considered significant. When maintenance is insignificant, we recognize the revenue when the agreement is signed and the software is shipped. Revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the services are performed. For E Business Solutions, which consists of Hoovers, Inc., we provide subscription solutions that provide continuous access to our business information databases. Revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is generally one year. Any additional solutions purchased are recognized once they are delivered to the customer. 30 Table of Contents Amounts billed in advance are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet as deferred revenue and are recognized as the services are performed. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for disclosure of the impact that recently issued accounting standards may have on our audited consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements. They should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes set forth in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Consolidated Revenue The following table presents our revenue by segment: For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Amounts in millions) Revenue: U.S. . $ 1,164.2 $ 1,087.8 $ 1,004.9 International 367.1 355.8 329.6 Core Revenue 1,531.3 1,443.6 1,334.5 Divested Businesses 79.5 Total Revenue $ 1,531.3 $ 1,443.6 $ 1,414.0 The following table presents our revenue by customer solution set: For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Amounts in millions) Revenue: Risk Management Solutions $ 985.5 $ 953.2 $ 882.0 Sales & Marketing Solutions 412.2 382.8 368.2 E Business Solutions 88.7 70.0 50.0 Supply Management Solutions 44.9 37.6 34.3 Core Revenue 1,531.3 1,443.6 1,334.5 Divested Businesses 79.5 Total Revenue $ 1,531.3 $ 1,443.6 $ 1,414.0 Year ended December 31, 2006 vs. Year ended December 31, 2005 Total revenue increased $87.7 million, or 6% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was driven by an increase in total U.S. revenue of $76.4 million, or 7%, and an increase in total International revenue of $11.3 million, or 3% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). 31 Table of Contents This $87.7 million increase is primarily attributed to: Growth in our Risk Management Solutions in the U.S. primarily related to growth in each of our subscription plans for Preferred Pricing Agreement and for Preferred Pricing Agreement with DNBi, from existing customers willing to increase the level of business they do with us; Increased demand from our existing customer base in our Sales & Marketing Solutions; Growth in our E Business Solutions, representing the results of Hoovers, Inc. The increase was primarily due to continued growth in subscription revenue; and Growth in our Supply Management Solutions, primarily in the U.S., due to new customers and includes eleven percentage points of growth as a result of the acquisition of Open Ratings in the first quarter of 2006; partially offset by: A decline in our Italian real estate data business (see our International Overview for further discussion); and A decline in revenue resulting from an expiration of both a five year licensing arrangement and an outsourcing arrangement with Receivable Management Services, Inc., in April 2006. Customer Solution Set On a customer solution set basis, the $87.7 million increase in total revenue reflects: A $32.3 million, or 3%, increase in Risk Management Solutions (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $29.0 million, or 4%, and growth in International of $3.3 million, or 1% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange); A $29.4 million, or 8%, increase in Sales & Marketing Solutions (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $24.3 million, or 7%, and an increase in International of $5.1 million, or 10% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange); A $18.7 million, or 27%, increase in E Business Solutions (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $16.0 million, or 24%, and growth in International of $2.7 million, or 97% (96% increase before the effect of foreign exchange); and A $7.3 million, or 19%, increase in Supply Management Solutions (20% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $7.1 million, or 21%, and an increase in International of $0.2 million, or 3% (4% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). Year ended December 31, 2005 vs. Year ended December 31, 2004 Total revenue increased $29.6 million, or 2% (1% increase before the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in total revenue was primarily driven by an increase in total U.S. revenue of $82.9 million, or 8%, partially offset by a decrease in total International revenue of $53.3 million, or 13% (15% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange). This $29.6 million increase is primarily attributed to: Growth in the U.S. subscription plan for existing customers willing to increase the level of business they do with us. The subscription plan provides our customers unlimited use of our Risk Management reports and data, within pre defined ranges, provided such customers commit to an increased level of spend from their historical levels; Growth in our E Business Solutions, representing the results of Hoovers, Inc. The increase was primarily due to continued growth in subscription revenue and increased advertising sales; 32 Table of Contents Growth in our Italian real estate data business, which contributed two percentage points of total revenue growth, mainly due to a price increase and the acquisition of a controlling interest in RIBES S.p.A., a leading provider of business information to Italian banks; and An increase in our Self Awareness Solutions, which allow our small business customers to establish, improve and protect their own credit; partially offset by: Our having divested certain businesses in 2004, which accounted for $79.5 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004; and A decrease in revenue from our United Kingdom (UK) market. Core revenue, which reflects total revenue less revenue from divested businesses, increased $109.1 million, or 8% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Customer Solution Set On a customer solution set basis, the $109.1 million increase in core revenue reflects: A $71.2 million, or 8%, increase in Risk Management Solutions (7% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $42.7 million, or 7%, and growth in International of $28.5 million, or 11% (8% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). International includes our Italian real estate data business, which contributed two percentage points of total Risk Management Solutions growth with the majority of the growth due to a price increase and the acquisition of a controlling interest in RIBES S.p.A.; A $14.6 million, or 4%, increase in Sales & Marketing Solutions (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $19.2 million, or 6%, partially offset by a decrease in International of $4.6 million, or 8% (9% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange); A $20.0 million, or 40%, increase in E Business Solutions (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $17.3 million, or 35%, and growth in International of $2.7 million. We first began offering our Hoovers solution to customers in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2004; and A $3.3 million, or 10%, increase in Supply Management Solutions (9% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $3.7 million, or 13%, partially offset by a decrease in International of $0.4 million, or 11% (12% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange). Consolidated Operating Costs The following table presents our consolidated operating costs and operating income: For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Amounts in millions) Operating Expenses $ 451.1 $ 412.0 $ 403.9 Selling and Administrative Expenses 619.0 600.8 612.0 Depreciation and Amortization 33.3 36.1 47.3 Restructuring Charge 25.5 30.7 32.0 Operating Costs $ 1,128.9 $ 1,079.6 $ 1,095.2 Operating Income $ 402.4 $ 364.0 $ 318.8 33 Table of Contents As described above in the section Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations How We Manage Our Business, when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole, we focus on our operating income (and, therefore, operating costs) before non core gains and charges, because we do not view these items as reflecting our underlying business operations. We have identified under the caption Non Core Gains and (Charges) below, such non core gains and charges that are included in our GAAP results. Operating Expenses Operating expenses increased by $39.1 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to the following: Costs associated with revenue generating investments in connection with our strategy, such as Acxiom (which will significantly increase the speed, data processing capacity and matching capabilities we provide our U.S. sales and marketing customers), and our DUNSRight quality process and investments in DNBi, our interactive, web based subscription service; Higher pension costs and lower postretirement benefit income (see section titled pension and postretirement for further discussion); Increased costs associated with the acquisition of Open Ratings in the first quarter of 2006; and The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R (see section titled stock based compensation for further discussion); partially offset by: An accrual reversal in our Italian real estate data business, which we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2006. The accrual reversal was the result of the successes in challenging the validity of certain tax increases and related legislative developments impacting the cost of our data acquisition from the Italian government (see section titled International Overview for further discussion); Savings from our continuous process of reengineering; and The impact of foreign exchange. Operating expenses increased by $8.1 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to the following: Certain tax legislation in Italy which had increased the operating costs of our Italian real estate data business in 2005; Investments in our DUNSRight quality process; and The impact of foreign exchange; partially offset by: Reduced costs as a result of the sale of our divested businesses to strategic partners in 2004 as part of our international market leadership strategy; and Improved efficiency and a reduction in the number of employees as a result of our continuous process of reengineering. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased $18.2 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to the following: Additional costs related to revenue generating investments as well as additional variable costs (such as commissions) incurred as a result of increased revenues; 34 Table of Contents Higher pension costs and lower postretirement benefit income (see section titled pension and postretirement for further discussion); and The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R (see section titled stock based compensation for further discussion); partially offset by: Savings from our continuous process of reengineering; Increased costs in 2005 related to the investigation and final resolution of the dispute on the sale of our French business with no comparable costs in 2006 and lower legal costs generally in 2006; and The impact of foreign exchange. Selling and administrative expenses decreased $11.2 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the following: Reduced costs associated with the sale of our divested businesses; and Administrative cost savings, such as lower compensation costs achieved through our Financial Flexibility Programs and lower spending for Sarbanes Oxley related expenses; partially offset by: The impact of foreign exchange. Matters Impacting Both Operating Expenses and Selling and Administrative Expenses Pension and Postretirement We had a net pension cost of $27.0 million and $13.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and net pension income of $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, for our pension plans globally. The increase in pension cost or decrease in pension income from 2004 through 2006 was primarily due to increased actuarial loss amortizations included in annual expense as required by SFAS No. 87. Actuarial loss amortizations included in annual pension expense for all global plans were $31.5 million, $25.2 million and $11.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, of which $29.2 million, $23.3 million and $8.2 million were attributable to our U.S. plans. The losses subject to amortization are primarily the result of asset losses from 2000 through 2002, and the impact of lower discount rates. Additionally, a decrease in the long term rate of return assumption for our U.S. Qualified Plan also contributed to the increase in expense during the period. The long term rate of return assumption was 8.25%, 8.50% and 8.75% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the pension costs for our U.S. plans for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 5.50%, 5.65% and 6.00%, respectively. We expect that the net pension cost in 2007 will be approximately $23.4 million for all of our global pension plans. The decrease in pension cost from 2006 to 2007 is primarily driven by a thirty four basis points increase in the discount rate applied to our U.S. plans at January 1, 2007 and lower actuarial loss amortization included in 2007. We had postretirement benefit income of $3.5 million, $5.7 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Lower postretirement benefit income for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005, was primarily due to lower negative prior service cost amortizations recognized in 2006 postretirement benefit income because of accelerated recognition 35 Table of Contents of prior service cost as a one time curtailment gain in 2005 associated with the 2004 and 2005 Financial Flexibility Programs. The curtailment gain is included within Restructuring Charges. The increase in postretirement benefit income from the year ended December 31, 2004 to the year ended December 31, 2005, was primarily due to the savings from the Medicare Reform Act which was implemented in the third quarter of 2004 versus a full year impact in 2005, as well as an actuarial gain from the 2005 plan valuation. We expect postretirement benefit income will be approximately $3.6 million in 2007. We consider net pension cost and postretirement benefit income to be part of our compensation costs, and, therefore, they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses, based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs. See the discussion of Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations, above, and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R, which required us to recognize stock based compensation for our stock option programs and ESPP. We have selected the modified prospective method and, therefore, prior periods have not been restated. Prior to January 1, 2006, we applied APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option programs. Accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized for grants under the stock option programs or the ESPP. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we recognized stockbased compensation expense of $20.8 million and $11.9 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2006, our total compensation expense was comprised of $12.7 million of stock option expense, $0.1 million of stock appreciation rights expense, $0.9 million of ESPP expense and $7.1 million (net of $0.5 million related to the accumulated effect of forfeiture assumptions) of restricted stock, restricted stock units and restricted stock opportunity expense. The restricted stock, restricted stock units and restricted stock opportunity expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $7.1 million (net of $0.5 million related to the accumulated effect of forfeiture assumptions) as compared to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was due to higher expense reversal as a result of higher forfeitures activity related to unvested shares, as well as lower restricted stock opportunities awarded to employees in 2006 versus 2005. In addition, the lower expense was further reduced by the forfeiture assumption required by SFAS No. 123R, including a cumulative effective adjustment (to reflect adjustments to previously recognized compensation expense for awards outstanding at the adoption date of SFAS No. 123R that we do not expect to vest). We consider these costs to be part of our compensation costs and, therefore, they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses, based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization decreased $2.8 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005. This decrease was primarily driven by the reduced capital requirements in our business in prior years, which has more recently been partially offset by increased costs in revenue generating investments as well as capital costs for newly leased facilities. Depreciation and amortization decreased $11.2 million, or 24%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004. This decrease was primarily driven by changes in our business model in prior years, which enabled us to reduce the capital requirements of our business through our continuous process of reengineering, leveraging strategic partners in key markets and outsourcing capital intensive activities. 36 Table of Contents Restructuring Charge During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a $23.4 million restructuring charge in connection with the Financial Flexibility Program announced in February 2006 (2006 Financial Flexibility Program), a $2.4 million net restructuring charge in connection with the Financial Flexibility Program announced in February 2005 (2005 Financial Flexibility Program) and a $0.3 million net restructuring curtailment gain in connection with the Financial Flexibility Program announced in February 2004 (2004 Financial Flexibility Program). The components of these charges and gains included: Severance and termination costs of $13.0 million associated with approximately 175 employees related to the 2006 Financial Flexibility Program and $2.1 million associated with approximately 25 employees related to the 2005 Financial Flexibility Program. During the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 200 positions and 25 positions were eliminated in conjunction with our 2006 Financial Flexibility Program and 2005 Financial Flexibility Program, respectively; Lease termination obligations, other costs to consolidate or close facilities and other exit costs of $10.4 million related to the 2006 Financial Flexibility Program and $0.4 million related to the 2005 Financial Flexibility Program; and Curtailment gains of $0.1 million for the 2005 Financial Flexibility Program and $0.3 million for the 2004 Financial Flexibility Program related to the U.S. postretirement benefit plan resulting from employee termination actions. In accordance with SFAS No. 106, we were required to recognize immediately a pro rata portion of the unrecognized prior service cost as a result of the employee terminations. At December 31, 2006, all actions under these programs were substantially completed. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a $30.8 million restructuring charge in connection with the 2005 Financial Flexibility Program and a $0.1 million net restructuring gain in connection with the 2004 Financial Flexibility Program. The components of these charges and gains included: Severance and termination costs of $23.3 million associated with approximately 425 employees related to the 2005 Financial Flexibility Program and $5.7 million associated with approximately 310 employees related to the 2004 Financial Flexibility Program. During the year ended December 31, 2005, approximately 370 positions and 340 positions were terminated in conjunction with our 2005 Financial Flexibility Program and 2004 Financial Flexibility Program, respectively; Lease termination obligations, other costs to consolidate or close facilities and other exit costs of $4.7 related to the 2005 Financial Flexibility Program; Curtailment charges of $3.1 million related to our pension plans and an immediate reduction to ongoing pension income of $3.4 million related to the U.S. Qualified Plan resulting from employee actions for the 2005 Financial Flexibility Program. In accordance with SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 88, we were required to recognize immediately a pro rata portion of the unrecognized prior service cost as a result of the employee terminations and the pension plan was required to be re measured which reduced our periodic pension income; and Curtailment gains of $3.7 million and $5.8 million related to the U.S. postretirement benefit plan resulting from employee actions for the 2005 Financial Flexibility Program and the 2004 Financial Flexibility Program, respectively. In accordance with SFAS No. 106, we were required to recognize immediately a pro rata portion of the unrecognized prior service cost as a result of the employee terminations. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded $32.0 million of restructuring charges in connection with the 2004 Financial Flexibility Program. The components of the restructuring charges included: Severance and termination costs of $28.4 million associated with approximately 900 employees; 37 Table of Contents Lease termination obligations, other costs to consolidate or close facilities and other exit costs of $3.1 million; Curtailment charges (in accordance with SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 88) of $0.9 million and an immediate reduction to ongoing pension income of $3.3 million related to our pension plans; and Gain (in accordance with SFAS No. 106) of $3.7 million related to the U.S. postretirement benefit plan. In October 2004, as part of the 2004 Financial Flexibility Program, we entered into an agreement with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) to outsource certain portions of our data acquisition and delivery, customer service, and financial processes. Under the terms of the agreement, approximately 220 employees who primarily performed certain customer service functions in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands were transitioned to IBM. We made total payments of approximately $1.8 million to IBM as full satisfaction of any of our existing liabilities for future severance benefits related to the transitioned employees. The severance benefits for the employees who transitioned to IBM are included in the restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2004, approximately 650 employees (including 220 employees who transitioned to IBM as part of the outsourcing agreement discussed above) were terminated in connection with the 2004 Financial Flexibility Program. During the year ended December 31, 2005, approximately 310 employees were terminated in connection with the 2004 Financial Flexibility Program which resulted in 960 employees terminated for this program in total. As of December 31, 2006, we have eliminated approximately 5,100 positions which included 350 open positions, and approximately 4,750 employees (via attrition and termination) under our Financial Flexibility Programs. These figures include the 220 employees who were transitioned to IBM as part of the 2004 Financial Flexibility Program and approximately 400 employees who were transitioned to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) as part of the Financial Flexibility Program announced in February 2002. Under the terms of the CSC agreement, we outsourced certain technology functions in which approximately 400 of our employees who performed data center operations, technology help desk and network management functions in the U.S. and in the UK were transitioned to CSC. Interest Income (Expense) Net The following table presents our Interest Income (Expense) Net: For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Amounts in millions) Interest Income $ 7.3 $ 10.6 $ 8.4 Interest Expense (20.3 ) (21.1 ) (18.9 ) Interest Income (Expense) Net $ (13.0 ) $ (10.5 ) $ (10.5 ) Interest income decreased $3.3 million, or 31%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005, primarily due to fewer interest bearing investments during the year ended December 31, 2006, partially offset by higher interest rates. Interest income increased $2.2 million, or 26%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004, primarily due to higher investment balances in marketable securities, as well as higher interest rates. Interest expense decreased by $0.8 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005, primarily due to lower interest rates associated with our $300 million fixed rate notes that we issued in March 2006 compared to higher interest rates associated with our $300 million fixed rate notes that 38 Table of Contents matured in March 2006 (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K), partially offset by higher outstanding borrowings on our credit facility during 2006. Interest expense increased by $2.2 million, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004, primarily due to higher interest rates.

(e) During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a reversal of $0.8 million of costs as a result of lower than expected costs related to the sale of our Iberian business. Provision for Income Taxes For each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, our effective tax rate was 37.8%. The effective tax rate for 2006, as compared to 2005, was positively impacted by 1.3 points for decreased interest expense on income tax reserves and by 0.6 points for lower state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 had been positively impacted by 4.5 points for foreign income taxes primarily related to the liquidation of dormant international entities that remained after the sale of our divested businesses in the Nordic 39 Table of Contents region and Iberia and was negatively impacted by 2.6 points for the tax associated with the repatriation of foreign cash in connection with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or (FSP) No. FAS 109 2. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10K. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our effective tax rate was 37.8% as compared to 37.9% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The effective tax rate for 2005, as compared to 2004, was positively impacted by 4.5 points for foreign income taxes primarily related to the liquidation of dormant International entities that remained after the sale of our divested businesses in the Nordic region (Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland) and Iberia, by 0.7 points for interest expense on tax reserves, and by 0.1 points for global tax initiatives and was negatively impacted by 2.6 points for the tax associated with the repatriation of foreign cash in connection with the adoption of FSP No. FAS 109 2, (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K), by 0.8 points resulting from the non deductibility in some countries of certain items included within the restructuring charges and by 1.0 point for state and local income taxes. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 had been positively impacted by 0.8 points related to research and development tax credits. Minority Interest Income (Expense) For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded minority interest expense of $1.8 million. Minority interest represents the minority owners share of net income of our majority owned Italian real estate data company, RIBES, S.p.A. Equity in Net Income of Affiliates We recorded $0.4 million, $0.7 million and $0.2 million as Equity in Net Income of Affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Earnings Per Share We reported the following earnings per share (EPS): For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2006 2005 2004 Basic Earnings Per Share $ 3.81 $ 3.31 $ 3.01 Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 3.70 $ 3.19 $ 2.90 For the year ended December 31, 2006, basic EPS increased 15%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2005, due to a 9% increase in net income and a 5% reduction in the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase programs. For the year ended December 31, 2006, diluted EPS increased 16%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2005, due to a 9% increase in net income and a 6% reduction in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase programs. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 5.1 million shares of common stock for $375.0 million under our Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs. In addition, basic and diluted EPS were impacted by our repurchases of 3.8 million shares of common stock for $287.7 million under our Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs to mitigate the dilutive effect of shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. For the year ended December 31, 2005, basic EPS and diluted EPS increased 10%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to a 4% increase in net income and a 5% reduction in the weighted 40 Table of Contents average number of basic shares and diluted shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase programs. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for $200.0 million under our Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs. In addition, basic and diluted EPS were impacted by our repurchases of 1.5 million shares of common stock for $95.6 million under our Board of Directors approved share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP (see Liquidity and Financial Position Cash Used in Financing Activities). Non Core Gains and (Charges) For internal management purposes, we treat certain gains and charges that are included in Consolidated Operating Costs, Other Income (Expense) Net and Provision for Income Taxes as non core gains and charges. These non core gains and charges are summarized in the table below. We exclude non core gains and charges when evaluating our financial performance because we do not consider these items to reflect our underlying business performance. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Amounts in millions) Non Core gains and (charges) included in Consolidated Operating Costs: Restructuring charges related to our Financial Flexibility Programs $ (25.5 ) $ (30.7 ) $ (32.0 ) Final resolution of all disputes on the sale of our French business $ $ (0.4 ) $ Non Core gains and (charges) included in Other Income (Expense) Net: Gain on sale of an investment in a South African Company $ $ 3.5 $ Final resolution of all disputes on the sale of our French business $ $ (3.7 ) $ Lower costs related to the sale of Iberia (Spain and Portugal) $ $ 0.8 $ Gains on sales of operations in the Nordic region, Central Europe, Iberia, France and India, and Distribution Channels in Pakistan and the Middle East $ $ $ 30.3 Non Core gains and (charges) included in Provision for Income Taxes: Increase in Legacy Tax Reserve for Utilization of Capital Losses 19891990 $ $ $ (4.5 ) Tax charge related to our repatriation of foreign cash $ $ (9.3 ) $ Charge/Increase in Legacy Tax Reserve for Royalty Expense Deductions 19931997 $ (0.8 ) $ (6.3 ) $ Tax Benefits recognized upon the liquidation of dormant International entities $ $ 16.3 $ Restructuring charges related to our Financial Flexibility Programs $ 8.6 $ 8.1 $ 11.2 Gain on sale of an investment in a South African Company $ $ (1.5 ) $ Final resolution of all disputes on the sale of our French business $ $ 1.5 $ Tax Legacy Refund for Utilization of Capital Losses 19891990 $ $ 0.9 $ Gains on sales of operations in the Nordic region, Central Europe, Iberia, France and India, and Distribution Channels in Pakistan and the Middle East $ $ $ (10.9 ) Segment Results The operating segments reported below are our segments for which separate financial information is available and upon which operating results are evaluated by management on a timely basis to assess performance and to allocate resources. On January 1, 2005, we began managing and reporting our operations in Canada as part of our International segment. As part of this change, our results are reported under the following two segments: U.S. and International. We have conformed historical amounts to reflect the new segment structure. 41 Table of Contents U.S. U.S. is our largest segment, representing 76%, 75% and 71% of our total revenue for the years ending December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and 76%, 75% and 75% of our core revenue for the years ending December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. There were no divestitures within this segment during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The following table presents our core revenue by customer solution set and U.S. operating income. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Amounts in millions) Revenue: Risk Management Solutions $ 684.7 $ 655.7 $ 613.0 Sales & Marketing Solutions 355.8 331.5 312.3 E Business Solutions 83.2 67.2 49.9 Supply Management Solutions 40.5 33.4 29.7 Core U.S. Revenue $ 1,164.2 $ 1,087.8 $ 1,004.9 Operating Income $ 425.8 $ 405.5 $ 354.9 Year ended December 31, 2006 vs. Year ended December 31, 2005 U.S. Overview U.S. total and core revenue increased $76.4 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is due to increased revenue in all of our customer solution sets. U.S. Customer Solution Sets On a customer solution set basis, the $76.4 million increase in core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects: Risk Management Solutions A $29.0 million, or 4%, increase in Risk Management Solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Traditional Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 76% of total U.S. Risk Management Solutions, increased 4%. There were two main drivers of this growth: Continued growth of each of our Preferred Pricing Agreement and Preferred Pricing Agreement with DNBi subscription plans, from existing customers who are willing to increase the level of business they do with us. These subscription plans provide our customers with unlimited use of our Risk Management reports and data, within pre defined ranges, provided such customers commit to an increased level of spend from their historical levels; and Higher purchases from our existing customers; partially offset by: The expiration in April 2006 of our five year licensing arrangement with Receivable Management Services, Inc. 42 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2006, Value Added Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 24% of total U.S. Risk Management Solutions, increased 7%. The primary drivers of this growth were: New customer acquisitions and higher purchases from our existing customers; partially offset by: A decline in revenue as a result of an expiration in April 2006 of a five year arrangement entered into in connection with the five year licensing arrangement referenced above; and A shift in product mix to some of our newer value added products where a larger portion of revenue is recognized over the term of the contract versus up front, at signing. We believe that we will continue to experience a greater percentage of sales on new solutions where revenue will be recognized in subsequent quarters. As a result, we believe that quarterly revenue will continue to be positively impacted by the recognition of deferred revenue from prior quarter sales, offset by the deferral of current sales revenue into subsequent periods. Sales & Marketing Solutions A $24.3 million, or 7%, increase in Sales & Marketing Solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Traditional Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 41% of total U.S. Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 3%. The increase was primarily driven by new customer acquisitions and increased demand from our existing customer base. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Value Added Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 59% of total U.S. Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 11%. The increase was primarily driven by increased demand from our existing customer base. E Business Solutions A $16.0 million, or 24%, increase in E Business Solutions, representing the results of Hoovers, Inc. The increase was primarily due to continued growth in subscription revenue and increased advertising sales. Supply Management Solutions A $7.1 million, or 21%, increase in Supply Management Solutions, on a small base, due to new customers and includes twelve points of percentage growth associated with our Open Ratings acquisition. Operating Income U.S. operating income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $425.8 million, as compared to $405.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $20.3 million, or 5%. The increase in operating income was primarily attributed to an increase in U.S. revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006, and savings from our continuous process of reengineering partially offset by costs associated with our revenue generating investments such as Acxiom (which will significantly increase the speed, data processing capacity and matching capabilities we provide our U.S. sales and marketing customers), higher pension costs and lower postretirement benefit income, the effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the impact of increased costs associated with data purchases from our international partners and increased costs associated with the acquisition of Open Ratings in the first quarter of 2006. 43 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2005 vs. Year ended December 31, 2004 U.S. Overview U.S. total and core revenue increased $82.9 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase is due to increased revenue in all of our customer solution sets. U.S. Customer Solution Sets On a customer solutions set basis, the $82.9 million increase in core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects: Risk Management Solutions A $42.7 million, or 7%, increase in Risk Management Solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Traditional Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 77% of total U.S. Risk Management Solutions, increased 5%. There were two main drivers of this growth: The continued growth in our subscription plan for existing customers who are willing to increase the level of business they do with us. The subscription plan provides our customers unlimited use of our Risk Management reports and data, within pre defined ranges, provided such customers commit to an increased level of spend from their historical levels; and Our Self Awareness Solutions, which allow our small business customers to establish, improve and protect their own credit. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Value Added Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 23% of total U.S. Risk Management Solutions, increased 15%. The increase was primarily attributable to higher renewal rates on software, and the sale of customized solutions and services that meet our customers needs. Sales & Marketing Solutions A $19.2 million, or 6%, increase in Sales & Marketing Solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Traditional Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 43% of total U.S. Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 7%. The increase was primarily driven by growth in our third party channels. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Value Added Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 57% of total U.S. Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased by 6%. The increase was primarily driven by new business acquisition and retained business in our existing customer base. E Business Solutions A $17.3 million, or 35%, increase in E Business Solutions, representing the results of Hoovers, Inc. The increase was primarily due to continued growth in subscription revenue and increased advertising sales. Supply Management Solutions A $3.7 million, or 13%, increase in Supply Management Solutions due to an increase in acquisition of new customers and increased value of our customer contract renewals. 44 Table of Contents Operating Income U.S. operating income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $405.5 million, as compared to $354.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $50.6 million, or 14%. The increase in operating income was due to an 8% increase in U.S. revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005, and the benefits of our continuous process of reengineering efforts, partially offset by related investments made to drive revenue growth. International International represented 24%, 25% and 29% of our total revenue for the three years ending December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and 24%, 25% and 25% of our core revenue for the three years ending December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The following table presents our International revenue by customer solution set and International operating income. Additionally, this table reconciles the non GAAP measure of core revenue to the GAAP measure of total revenue by customer solution set and operating income. For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Amounts in millions) Revenue: Risk Management Solutions $ 300.8 $ 297.5 $ 269.0 Sales & Marketing Solutions 56.4 51.3 55.9 E Business Solutions 5.5 2.8 0.1 Supply Management Solutions 4.4 4.2 4.6 Core International Revenue 367.1 355.8 329.6 Divested Businesses 79.5 Total International Revenue $ 367.1 $ 355.8 $ 409.1 Operating Income $ 83.3 $ 62.2 $ 74.7 Year ended December 31, 2006 vs. Year ended December 31, 2005 International Overview Total revenue and core revenue were the same for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, as there were no divestitures during these periods. Therefore, our discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, references only our core revenue results. International core revenue increased $11.3 million, or 3% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is primarily a result of: Increased revenue in our UK market, due in part to poor operating performance in the first half of 2005 and higher product usage in 2006 from a key global customer; Increased revenue in our Asia Pacific markets due to a shift in the timing of a customer renewal from the fourth quarter of 2005 into the first quarter of 2006 and higher license fee revenue; Increased revenue from our international partners attributable to royalty payments, fulfillment services on behalf of our partnerships and product usage; and Increased revenue from our E Business Solutions primarily attributable to increased market penetration of our Hoovers solution; partially offset by: A decline in our traditional Risk Management Solutions, primarily related to our Italian real estate data business (see below for further discussion). 45 Table of Contents International Customer Solution Sets On a customer solution set basis, the $11.3 million increase in International core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, reflects: Risk Management Solutions An increase in Risk Management Solutions of $3.3 million, or 1% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), reflecting: Traditional Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 88% of International Risk Management Solutions, was flat compared with prior year (1% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). We experienced increased revenue in our UK market due in part to poor operating performance in the first half of 2005 and higher product usage in 2006 from a key global customer. Also, we recognized increased revenue from our international partnerships and increased license fee revenue from our Asia Pacific markets. This increase was partially offset by a general decline in product usage primarily in our Italian real estate data business. This decline in product usage resulted from certain tax legislation in Italy impacting a subset of our customers (e.g., tax collectors and our monitoring service business). Value Added Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 12% of International Risk Management Solutions, increased 8% (5% increase before the effect of foreign exchange) driven mainly by higher value project oriented business in certain of our International markets, partially offset by a loss in customers in our Italian market which resulted in lower renewals and lower project oriented business. Sales & Marketing Solutions An increase in Sales & Marketing Solutions of $5.1 million, or 10% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), reflecting: Traditional Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 58% of International Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 14% (15% increase before the effect of foreign exchange), reflecting a lower rate of cancellations in the first quarter of 2006 as compared to the prior year period and increased purchases from certain global customers in our Asia Pacific markets. Value Added Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 42% of International Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 6% (3% increase before the effect of foreign exchange) due primarily to royalty revenue from our international partnerships, a shift in the timing of a customer renewal from the fourth quarter of 2005 into the first quarter of 2006 and an increase in purchases by customers in our Asia Pacific markets. This increase was partially offset by lower project oriented business. E Business Solutions An increase in E Business Solutions of $2.7 million, or 97% (96% before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase is primarily attributed to increased market penetration of our Hoovers solutions to customers in Europe and Canada. Supply Management Solutions An increase in Supply Management Solutions of $0.2 million, or 3% (4% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). 46 Table of Contents Operating Income International operating income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $83.3 million, compared to $62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $21.1 million, or 34%, primarily due to: An increase in core revenue; A $7.5 million accrual reversal in our Italian real estate data business, which we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2006. The accrual reversal was the result of the successes in challenging the validity of certain tax increases and related legislative developments impacting the cost of our data acquisition from the Italian government. Increased data sales to our U.S. segment; Increased costs in 2005 related to the investigation and final resolution of the dispute on the sale of our French business with no comparable costs in 2006 and generally lower legal costs in 2006; and Savings from our continuous process of reengineering; partially offset by: Increased selling expenses related to increased revenue; and The impact of increased costs associated with data purchases from our international partners. Certain additional factors affecting our International segment create particular challenges for our International business. For example, our results have been, and may continue to be, significantly impacted by legislative changes affecting the fees charged by the Italian government to acquire and or re use data, as well as the possibility that government agencies may seek to enter the market and compete with our services. Specifically, the reported results herein reflect significant price increases to customers of our Italian real estate data business that we implemented during the second quarter of 2005. These price increases were implemented to offset new regulations that significantly increased data acquisition costs for our Italian real estate data business and required that we paid a fee each time we resold that data. We challenged such regulations in court and with anti trust authorities, sustaining significant legal and management costs; withheld certain payments to the government and established the appropriate reserves. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we released a portion of the reserves as a result of successes in challenging the validity of certain tax increases and related legislative developments. We continue to actively monitor the status of this and other legislative developments. We also intend to pursue favorable resolution of this matter. Consistent with our financial flexibility model to the extent we are successful and are able to pursue all or a portion of the remaining $8.0 million accrual, we will look for opportunities to reinvest these amounts in the business to fund our growth strategy. Year ended December 31, 2005 vs. Year ended December 31, 2004 International Overview International total revenue decreased $53.3 million, or 13% (15% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The decline is primarily a result of: Our having divested certain businesses, which for the year ended December 31, 2004, accounted for $79.5 million of revenue; and A decrease in revenue from our UK market; partially offset by: Our Italian real estate data business, which contributed six percentage points of revenue growth, mainly due to a price increase and the acquisition of a controlling interest in RIBES S.p.A., a leading provider of business information to Italian banks; and 47 Table of Contents An aggregate increase in revenue from our other International markets. International core revenue, which reflects International total revenue less revenue from businesses divested in 2004, increased $26.2 million, or 8% (6% increase before the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. International Customer Solution Sets On a customer solution set basis, the $26.2 million increase in International core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 versus the year ended December 31, 2004 reflects: Risk Management Solutions A $28.5 million, or 11%, increase in Risk Management Solutions (8% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). For the year ended December 31, 2005, Traditional Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 89% of International Risk Management Solutions, increased 10% (8% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). This growth was attributable primarily to: Our Italian real estate data business, which contributed eight percentage points of such growth, mainly due to a price increase and the acquisition of a controlling interest in RIBES S.p.A.; and An increase in revenue in our other International markets, primarily resulting from increased product usage by existing customers; partially offset by: A decrease in revenue in the UK resulting primarily from the continued impact of lower customer product usage due to our insufficient focus on customer renewals in late 2004 and the first quarter of 2005. In the second half of 2005, we introduced a subscription plan in our European markets, leveraging our success in rolling out a similar program in the U.S. This new plan provides our customers unlimited use, within pre defined ranges, of our Risk Management reports and data, provided such customers commit to an increased level of spend from their historical levels. We believe that the subscription plan will be an important contribution to our revenue growth in future years. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Value Added Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 11% of total International Risk Management Solutions, increased 14% (12% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was primarily driven by new project oriented business in our Canadian and Asia Pacific markets. Sales & Marketing Solutions A $4.6 million, or 8%, decrease in Sales & Marketing Solutions (9% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange). For the year ended December 31, 2005, Traditional Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 56% of our International Sales & Marketing Solutions, decreased 24% (25% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange). Such decrease was primarily attributed to lower revenue in the UK, resulting from a highly competitive marketplace. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our Value Added Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 44% of our total International Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 23% (22% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). This was primarily attributable to an increase in purchases by customers utilizing our new value added solutions and revenue from our international partners. 48 Table of Contents E Business Solutions International revenue also benefited from $2.8 million of revenue from E Business Solutions. We first began offering our Hoovers solution to customers in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2004. Supply Management Solutions A $0.4 million, or 11%, decrease in Supply Management Solutions (12% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange). Operating Income International operating income decreased $12.5 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to: A decline in revenue in the UK; The loss of income from our divested businesses; and Increased expenses related to the investigation and final resolution of a dispute arising out of the sale of our French business; partially offset by: The benefits of our continuous process of reengineering efforts; and An increase in revenue from other International markets. Market Risk We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of certain of our investments. We employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies. We use short term foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge short term foreign currency denominated loans, investments and certain third party and intercompany transactions and, from time to time, we have used foreign exchange option contracts to reduce our international earnings exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, from time to time, we use interest rate instruments to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure on our outstanding fixed rate notes, as discussed under Interest Rate Risk below. A discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Interest Rate Risk Our objective in managing exposure to interest rates is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on our earnings, cash flows and financial position, and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a policy that floating rate debt be managed within a minimum and maximum range of our total debt exposure. To manage our exposure, we may use fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and or interest rate swaps. On September 30, 2005 and February 10, 2006, we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of $200 million and $100 million, respectively. The objective of these hedges was to 49 Table of Contents mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in Treasury rates in anticipation of the debt issuance discussed below. These transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges, and as such, changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of debt issuance were recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. In connection with the issuance of the 2011 notes, these interest rate derivative transactions were terminated, resulting in proceeds of approximately $5.0 million at the date of termination. The proceeds are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and are being amortized over the life of the 2011 notes. In connection with the $300 million, five year, fixed rate senior note maturing March 2006, we entered into fixed to floating (LIBOR rate indexed) interest rate swap agreements in the third quarter of 2001 with a notional principal amount totaling $100 million, and designated these swaps as fair value hedges against the long term, fixed rate notes. The arrangement was considered a highly effective hedge, and therefore the accounting for these hedges had no impact on earnings. The changes in the fair value of the hedge and the designated portion of the notes were reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. In March 2006, we issued senior notes with a face value of $300 million that mature on March 15, 2011 (the 2011 notes), bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 5.50%, payable semi annually. The proceeds were used to repay our then outstanding $300 million notes which matured on March 15, 2006. The swap agreements expired in March 2006 contemporaneous with the note repayment. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $300 million bank revolving credit facility available at prevailing short term interest rates, which expires in September 2009. At December 31, 2006 we had $159.5 million of floating rate debt outstanding under this facility. At December 31, 2005, we had no floating rate debt outstanding under this facility. Foreign Exchange Risk We have numerous offices in countries outside the U.S. and conduct operations in various countries through minority equity investments and strategic relationships with local players. Our International operations generated approximately 24% and 25% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Approximately 31% and 29% of our assets as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were located outside the U.S., and no country outside the U.S., other than the UK, had a significant concentration of our aggregate cash balances. Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings, cash flows and financial position of our International operations. We follow a policy of hedging balance sheet positions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries. In addition, we are subject to foreign exchange risk associated with our International earnings and investments. We use short term, foreign exchange forward and option contracts to implement our hedging strategies. Typically, these contracts have maturities of twelve months or less. These contracts are executed with creditworthy institutions and are denominated primarily in the British pound sterling, the Euro and Canadian dollar. The gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with the balance sheet positions and International earnings hedges are recorded in Other Income (Expense) Net in our consolidated financial statements and are essentially offset by the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency transactions. The gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with net investment hedges, if any, are recorded as cumulative translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in our consolidated financial statements. As in prior years, we have hedged substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries with short term forward foreign exchange contracts. In addition, from time to time, we use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain foreign earnings and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain net investment positions. As of December 31, 2006, there were $25.4 million in option contracts outstanding. The underlying transactions and the corresponding forward exchange and option contracts are mark to market at the end of each quarter, and are reflected within our consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a notional amount of approximately $184.5 million and $212.1 million, respectively, of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding that offset foreign currency denominated intercompany loans. Gains and losses associated with these contracts were $0.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006, $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005, and $0.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004. In addition, at December 31, 2004, we had $91.9 million of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding associated with our international investments. Losses associated with these contracts were $3.6 million at December 31, 2004. These contracts typically have various expiration dates within three months of entry into such contracts. If exchange rates on average were to increase 10% from year end levels, the unrealized loss would be approximately $12.8 million. If exchange rates on average were to decrease 10% from year end levels, the unrealized gain would be approximately $14.5 million. However, the estimated potential gain and loss on these contracts is expected to be substantially offset by changes in the dollar value of the underlying transactions. Liquidity and Financial Position In connection with our commitment to delivering Total Shareholder Return (TSR), we will remain highly disciplined in the use of our shareholders cash, maintaining three key priorities for the use of this cash: First, making ongoing investments in the business to drive organic growth; Second, continuing to look at value accretive acquisitions to enhance our capabilities and accelerate our growth; and Third, continuing to return cash to shareholders. We believe that cash provided by operating activities, supplemented as needed with readily available financing arrangements, is sufficient to meet our short term needs, including the cash cost of restructuring charges, transition costs, contractual obligations and contingencies (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K), excluding the legal matters identified therein for which exposures cannot be estimated. In addition, we believe that our ability to readily access the bank and capital markets for incremental financing needs will enable us to meet our continued commitment to TSR. For example, in March 2006, we issued senior notes with a face value of $300 million that mature on March 15, 2011, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 5.50%, payable semi annually. These proceeds were used to repay our existing $300 million notes that matured on March 15, 2006 (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). We have the ability to access the short term borrowings market from time to time to fund working capital needs, acquisitions and share repurchases, when needed. Such borrowings would be supported by our bank revolving credit facility, when needed. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $304.9 million, $261.5 million and $267.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Year ended December 31, 2006 vs. Year ended December 31, 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase was primarily driven by lower tax payments as a result of the settlement of a certain legacy tax matter in 2005, and, in 2006, the increased net income of our underlying business excluding the impact of non cash gains and losses, an increase in deferred revenue resulting from higher sales and collection of a third party receivable. Additionally, we experienced lower restructuring payments in 2006. 51 Table of Contents Our cash inflows were partially offset by an increase in our Other Long Term Assets in 2006 primarily due to a deposit made to the IRS in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies related to the legacy tax matters discussed in Note 13 Contingencies (Tax Matters) to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The implementation of SFAS No. 123R required the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax impact of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow. As a result, this requirement reduced net operating cash flows and increased net financing cash flows by $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Included in the $39.6 million, was $19.2 million associated with the exercise of 1.0 million Moodys stock options. In addition, we experienced an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2006 as well as the extension of longer terms to customers as compared to the prior year period and a decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments. Year ended December 31, 2005 vs. Year ended December 31, 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. This decline was driven by increased tax payments due to the settlement of certain legacy tax matters in 2005. In addition, restructuring payments for the year ended December 31, 2005 related to our Financial Flexibility Programs were higher than those made for the year ended December 31, 2004. Partially offsetting these increased uses of cash, during 2005, we experienced increased net income of our underlying business excluding the impact of non cash gains and losses, increased tax refunds, a decline in our cash outflows in accrued liabilities due to the timing of amounts due and an increase in deferred revenue resulting from higher sales. Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Our business is not capital intensive, and most of our spending to grow the business is funded by operating cash flow. As a result of our Financial Flexibility Programs, we have sold non core businesses and real estate assets in prior years. Proceeds from these sales have partially (or in some cases, fully) offset our capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles. In 2006, capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles were funded by operating cash flows. Net cash provided by investing activities was $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $54.1 million and $39.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Year ended December 31, 2006 vs. Year ended December 31, 2005 Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with net cash used in investing activities of $54.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The $101.4 million increase primarily reflects the following activities: During the year ended December 31, 2006, we had $109.4 million of net redemptions in short term marketable securities, as compared to a net increase in our investment in marketable securities of $26.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005; Reduced acquisition payments in 2006 as compared to 2005 as follows: During the year ended December 31, 2006, we acquired Open Ratings for approximately $8.3 million, inclusive of cash acquired of $0.4 million and $0.3 million of transaction costs. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K; During the year ended December 31, 2006, we made a payment of $1.3 million related to a new joint venture. We signed an agreement in November 2006 with Huaxia International Credit Consulting Co. Limited, a leading provider of business information and credit management services in China, to 52 Table of Contents establish a new joint venture called Huaxia D&B China. We will be the majority shareholder in the new joint venture; In 2005, we acquired Live Capital, Inc. We paid $16.7 million net of cash acquired of $0.5 million; In 2005, we received net proceeds from divestitures and the sale of an investment in South Africa; and In addition, in 2005, we increased our investment in RIBES S.p.A (see below for further discussion). partially offset by: Increased capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005 (see below for further discussion). Year ended December 31, 2005 vs. Year ended December 31, 2004 Net cash used in investing activities totaled $54.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with net cash used in investing activities of $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase primarily relates to the following activities in both years. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we increased our net investment in marketable securities by $26.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we increased our net investment in marketable securities by $70.8 million. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we received net proceeds of $16.5 million and $65.8 million, respectively, primarily due to the sale of the following: During the first quarter of 2005, we sold our equity investment in South Africa for net proceeds of $5.0 million; During the second quarter of 2005, we collected the remaining $2.0 million other receivables balance related to the sale in May 2004 of our Central European operations to Bonnier Affarsinformation AB (Bonnier). Proceeds were $25.7 million, consisting of $18.1 million in cash and $7.6 million in other receivables, of which $5.6 million was collected in June 2004; During the year ended December 31, 2005, we collected $9.5 million related to the sale in October 2004 of our operations in France to Base DInformations Legales Holding S.A.S. (BIL Holding). Proceeds from the sale were $30.1 million, primarily consisting of $15.0 million in cash ($2.1 million net of cash divested), $14.0 million in other receivables and $1.1 million in other assets; During the first quarter of 2004, we sold our operations in India and our Distribution Channels in Pakistan and the Middle East for $7.7 million. We received proceeds of $7.3 million (net of withholding tax), consisting of cash of $6.5 million and an investment in the amount of $0.8 million representing a 10% remaining interest in the divested entity; During the first quarter of 2004, we sold our operations in the Nordic region to Bonnier. We received proceeds from the sale of $42.7 million, consisting of cash of $35.9 million, notes receivable of $5.9 million, of which $0.8 million had been collected in 2004 and another receivable of $0.9 million. In the second quarter of 2004, we wrote off the other receivable of $0.9 million related to this transaction; During the second quarter of 2004 we completed the sale of our Central European operations to Bonnier. Proceeds were $25.7 million, consisting of $18.1 million in cash ($7.6 million net of cash divested) and $7.6 million in other receivables, of which $5.6 million was collected in June 2004; and During the fourth quarter of 2004, we completed the sale of our operations in Iberia. Proceeds from the sale of our Iberian operations to Informa S.A. were $13.5 million which consisted of $13.2 million in cash ($6.3 million net of cash divested) and $0.3 million in other assets. 53 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we made payments of $18.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively, primarily due to the following: During the third quarter of 2005 we acquired LiveCapital, Inc. We paid $16.7 million, net of cash acquired of $0.5 million; and During the third quarter of 2005, we paid the remaining balance of $1.4 million to RIBES S.p.A relating to the 2004 acquisition of an additional 16% interest in RIBES S.p.A. This additional interest resulted in a 51% controlling interest in RIBES S.p.A. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we acquired the additional 16% interest in RIBES S.p.A. for $3.4 million (net of cash acquired), of which $2.0 million was paid during the fourth quarter of 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we invested $1.9 million to acquire 17.5% of RIBES S.p.A. Capital Expenditures Investments in capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles were $53.0 million, $28.6 million and $28.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $24.4 million increase from the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, was driven by our U.S. segment due to increased investments in our DUNSRight quality process and DNBi, our interactive web based subscription product, as well as, in our International segment, where the majority of capital investments were primarily for a new UK facility and the D&B Worldwide network. We anticipate an increase in capital expenditures in 2007, though at a level not to exceed 5% of revenue, consistent with our TSR strategy. Cash Settlements Cash settlements of our foreign currency contracts for our hedged transactions resulted in $0.8 million of cash outflow, $2.0 million of cash inflow and $4.8 million of cash outflow for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K related to our financial instruments. Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $431.5 million, $241.2 million and $233.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As set forth below for all years, these changes primarily relate to share repurchases, stock based proceeds from stock option exercises and spin off obligations. Share Repurchases In connection with our commitment to TSR, our Board of Directors has approved certain share repurchase programs, as follows: In February 2004, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million, one year share repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for $200.0 million under this program. This program was completed in December 2004. In February 2005, our Board of Directors approved a $400 million, two year share repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we repurchased 3.2 million shares for $200.0 million under this program. In January 2006, our Board of Directors approved the addition of $100 million to the $400 million, two year program for a total of $500 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 4.2 million shares of common stock for $300.0 million. The program was completed in September 2006. 54 Table of Contents In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a new $200 million, one year share repurchase program which commenced in October 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 0.9 million shares of common stock for $75.0 million under this share repurchase program. We anticipate this program will be completed by October 2007. In addition, in order to mitigate the dilutive effect of the shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP, we have the following share repurchase programs in place: In July 2003, we announced a three year, six million share repurchase program to offset dilution under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock for $199.8 million, 1.5 million shares of common stock for $95.6 million and 1.0 million shares of common stock for $51.8 million under this program, respectively. This program was completed in September 2006. In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a new four year, five million share repurchase program to offset dilution under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for $87.9 million under this program. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we borrowed $385.2 million and repaid $225.7 million under our credit facility primarily to fund our share repurchase programs. Stock based Programs For the year ended December 31, 2006, net proceeds from our exercised stock based awards were $50.5 million compared with $64.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily attributed to fewer stock options being exercised partially offset by an increase in the weighted average exercise price of stock options. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net proceeds from our exercised stock based awards were $64.5 million compared with $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily driven by increased stock option exercise activity in 2005 as compared to 2004. In addition, the implementation of SFAS No. 123R, effective January 1, 2006, requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax impact of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow. This requirement reduced net operating cash flows and increased financing cash flows by $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Spin off Obligations As part of our spin off from Moodys/D&B2 in 2000, Moodys and D&B entered into a Tax Allocation Agreement dated as of September 30, 2000 (the TAA). Based on the TAA, we made a payment of $20.9 million to Moodys/D&B2 in 2006 under the TAA which was fully accrued as of December 31, 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we made a payment of approximately $9.2 million to Moodys/D&B2 under the TAA. See Future Liquidity Sources and Uses of Funds Contractual Obligations for further detail. Contractual Obligations Debt In March 2006, we issued senior notes with a face value of $300 million that mature on March 15, 2011, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 5.50%, payable semi annually. The proceeds were used to repay our existing $300 million notes bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.625%, payable semi annually, which matured in March 2006. 55 Table of Contents Credit Facility In September 2004, we entered into a $300 million bank revolving credit facility which bears interest at prevailing short term interest rates and will expire in September 2009. This facility also supports our commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, we had $159.5 million of borrowings outstanding under this facility. We had not drawn on the facility and did not have any borrowings outstanding under the facility for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. We did not borrow under our commercial paper program for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 or 2004. The bank credit facility requires the maintenance of interest coverage and total debt to earnings before income, tax depreciation and amortization ratios (each as defined in the facility). We were in compliance with these requirements for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Future Liquidity Sources and Uses of Funds Contractual Cash Obligations The following table quantifies, as of December 31, 2006, our contractual obligations that will require the use of cash in the future. Contractual Obligations Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (Amounts in millions) Long Term Debt(1) $ 458.9 $ $ $ 159.5 $ $ 299.4 $ Operating Leases(2) $ 167.0 $ 33.9 $ 27.3 $ 23.7 $ 18.4 $ 16.6 $ 47.1 Obligations to Outsourcers(3) $ 500.8 $ 95.5 $ 93.3 $ 92.6 $ 88.8 $ 84.7 $ 45.9 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Payments/Contributions(4) $ 1,012.4 $ 39.4 $ 35.7 $ 34.7 $ 36.4 $ 43.6 $ 822.6 Spin off Obligation(5) $ 28.5 $ 28.5 $ $ $ $ $ (1) $299.4 million represents our senior notes with a face value of $300 million that mature in March 2011, net of a $0.6 million discount, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 5.50%, payable semi annually. $159.5 million represents our borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facility at short term interest rates. (2) Most of our operations are conducted from leased facilities, which are under operating leases that expire over the next 10 years, with the majority expiring within five years. We also lease certain computer and other equipment under operating leases that expire over the next three years. These computer and other equipment leases are frequently renegotiated or otherwise changed as the lease terms expire and as advancements in computer technology present opportunities to lower costs and improve performance. (3) In July 2002, we outsourced certain technology functions to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) under a 10 year agreement, which we may terminate for a fee at any time and under certain conditions. Under the terms of the agreement, CSC is responsible for the data center operations, technology help desk, network management functions and for certain application development and maintenance in the U.S. and UK. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred $76.1 million under this contract and have a remaining commitment of approximately $409 million. The obligation under the contract is based on our historical and expected future level of usage and volume. If our future volume changes, payments under the contract could vary up or down based on specified formulas. Charges are subject to increases to partially offset inflation. In December 2003, we signed a three year agreement with ICT Group, Inc. (ICT), effective January 2004, to outsource certain marketing call center activities, which contains a renewal option for up to a one year period. We elected to renew for such one year period. Under the terms of the agreement, ICT will be responsible for performing certain marketing and credit calling activities previously performed by D&Bs own call centers in North America. The obligation under the contract is based upon transmitted call volumes, but shall not be less than $3 million per contract year. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred $4.1 million under this contract and have a remaining commitment of approximately $3 million. 56 Table of Contents In October 2004, we signed a seven year outsourcing agreement with IBM. Under the terms of the agreement, we have transitioned certain portions of our data acquisition and delivery, customer service and financial processes to IBM. We may terminate this agreement for a fee at any time. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred $25.5 million under this contract and have a remaining commitment of approximately $60 million. In July 2006, we signed new product and technology outsourcing agreements with Acxiom Corporation that will significantly increase the speed, data processing capacity and matching capabilities we provide our U.S. sales and marketing customers. We incurred fulfillment costs of $1.5 million in 2006 and have a remaining commitment of approximately $21 million. (4) Represents projected contributions to our non U.S. defined benefit plans as well as projected benefit payments related to our unfunded plans, including the U.S. Non Qualified Plans and our postretirement benefit plan. We do not expect to make any contributions to our U.S. Qualified Plan. The expected benefits are estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure our benefit obligation at the end of 2006 and include benefits attributable to estimated future employee service. A closed group approach is used in calculating the projected benefit payments, assuming only the participants who are currently in the valuation population are included in the projection and the projected benefits continue for up to approximately 99 years. (5) As part of our spin off from Moodys/D&B2 in 2000, Moodys and D&B entered into the TAA dated as of September 30, 2000. Under the TAA, Moodys/D&B2 and D&B agreed that Moodys/D&B2 would be entitled to deduct compensation expense associated with the exercise of Moodys/D&B2 stock options (including Moodys/D&B2 options exercised by D&B employees) and D&B would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with the exercise of D&B stock options (including D&B options exercised by employees of Moodys/D&B2). Put simply, the tax deduction would go to the company that granted the stock options, rather than to the employer of the individual who exercised the options. The TAA provides, however, that if the IRS issues rules, regulations or other authority contrary to the agreed upon treatment of the compensation expense deductions under the TAA, then the party that becomes entitled under such guidance to take the deduction may be required to reimburse the tax benefit it has realized, in order to indemnify the other party for its loss of such deduction. The IRS issued rulings discussing an employers entitlement to stock option deductions after a spin off or liquidation that appear to require that the compensation expense deduction belongs to the employer of the option grantee and not to the issuer of the option (i.e., D&B would be entitled to deduct compensation expense associated with a D&B employee exercising a Moodys/D&B2 option). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we made a payment of approximately $20.9 million to Moodys/D&B2 under the TAA that was fully accrued as of December 31, 2005. In addition, under the TAA, we received the benefit of additional tax deductions and under the TAA we may be required to reimburse Moodys/D&B2 for the loss of income tax deductions relating to 2002 to 2006 of approximately $28.5 million in the aggregate for such years. This potential reimbursement is a reduction to shareholders equity. We may also be required to pay additional amounts in the future based upon interpretations by the parties of the TAA, timing of future exercises of options, the future price of stock underlying the stock options and relevant tax rates. As of December 31, 2006, current and former employees of D&B held 1.2 million Moody stock options. These stock options had a weighted average exercise price of $11.47 and a remaining, weighted average contractual life of two years as of December 31, 2006. All of these options are currently exercisable. Capital Structure Every year we examine our capital structure and review our plans. During 2007, in connection with our commitment to TSR, we anticipate continued share repurchases and have initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on March 29, 2007, to shareholders of record on the close of business on March 8, 2007, as declared by our Board of Directors on January 29, 2007. 57 Table of Contents We believe that cash provided by operating activities, supplemented as needed with readily available financing arrangements, is sufficient to meet our short term needs, including the cash cost of restructuring charges, transition costs, contractual obligations and contingencies, excluding the legal matters identified herein for which exposures cannot be estimated. As we execute our long term TSR strategy, which contemplates strategic acquisitions, we may require or consider additional financing to fund our TSR strategy. We regularly evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile and various financing alternatives for opportunities to enhance our financial flexibility. While we feel confident that such financing arrangements are available to us, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to access new sources of liquidity when required. Share Repurchases and Dividends In order to mitigate the dilutive effect of the shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP, our Board of Directors approved in August 2006, a new four year, five million share repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for $87.9 million under this program with 3.9 million shares remaining to be repurchased. In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a new $200 million, one year share repurchase program which commenced in October 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 0.9 million shares of common stock for $75.0 million under this share repurchase program with $125.0 million remaining to be repurchased. We commenced this share repurchase program in October 2006 and anticipate that this program will be completed by October 2007. This share repurchase program expires one year from the date of commencement. We may consider initiating a new repurchase program on or around that time. We did not pay any dividends on our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. On February 1, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors approved the initiation of a dividend and declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share. This initial cash dividend is payable on March 29, 2007, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 8, 2007. Potential Payments in Tax and Legal Matters We and our predecessors are involved in certain tax and legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. These matters are at various stages of resolution, but could ultimately result in significant cash payments as described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We believe we have adequate reserves recorded in our consolidated financial statements for our share of current exposures in these matters. Financial Flexibility Program On January 9, 2007, we announced our 2007 Financial Flexibility Program. Our 2007 Financial Flexibility Program is designed to significantly reduce the complexity of our business. This program will create financial flexibility through several initiatives, including the following: Organizational Design: this initiative is intended to improve the efficiency of how we are organized and how we operate as a business by addressing spans of control, organizational layers and the effectiveness of leadership processes; Product and Technology Complexity: this initiative is intended to simplify our product and technology environment by reducing product complexity and proliferation as well as eliminating and consolidating systems and technology infrastructure; Sales Force Effectiveness: this initiative is intended to improve our sales force tools, reduce the non selling time of our sales force and enhance our new customer acquisition activities; and Other Efficiency Measures: this initiative is intended to improve the operating efficiencies of our facilities, reduce our purchasing costs and simplify our data collection and product delivery. 58 Table of Contents We expect to complete all actions under the 2007 program by December 2007. On an annualized basis, these actions are expected to create $80 million to $85 million of financial flexibility, of which approximately $60 million to $65 million will be generated in 2007, before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of savings generated by the initiatives. To implement these initiatives, we expect to incur transition costs of approximately $13 million to $15 million. In addition, we expect to incur restructuring charges, totaling $30 million to $35 million pre tax, of which $27 million to $32 million relate to severance, approximately $1 million relates to lease termination obligations and approximately $2 million relate to other exit costs in 2007. Approximately $42 million to $49 million of these transition costs and restructuring charges are expected to result in cash expenditures. As a result of this reengineering program, we expect that approximately 400 positions will be eliminated globally. Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefit Plan Contribution Requirements For financial statement reporting purposes, the funded status of our pension plans, as determined in accordance with GAAP, had a surplus of $199.0 million for the U.S. Qualified Plan, a deficit of $235.0 million for the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, and a deficit of $106.0 million for the non U.S. plans at December 31, 2006, as compared to a surplus of $76.2 million, a deficit of $247.4 million, and a deficit of $62.1 million, respectively for such plans, at December 31, 2005. The improvement in the funded status of the U.S. plans was due primarily to the lower projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2006, driven by a higher discount rate and the gains in the plans equity and real estate investments. The decrease in funded status of the non U.S. plans was primarily due to a higher projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2006, driven by a lower discount rate, the application of updated mortality tables and other assumptions, partially offset by the gains in plan asset performance. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. For funding purposes, as governed by the Internal Revenue Service regulations, we are not required to contribute to the U.S. Qualified Plan, the largest of our six plans, in 2007 as the plan was considered fully funded under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for the 2006 plan year. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA 2006) was signed into law. One of the principal changes under this legislation relates to the way assets and liabilities are valued to determine required pension contributions. The majority of the changes are effective in 2008. At the current date, there are still factors that need to be clarified or defined in the guidance by the regulatory bodies to fully analyze the impact of PPA 2006 on our plans. Based on the current understanding of the legislative changes, if the U.S. Qualified Plan asset returns are flat and the assets decline by the amount of benefits paid to plan participants, and all other factors affecting when contributions are required remain the same, we would not be required to make contributions to this plan until 2010. If plan assets appreciate between now and 2010, the need to make a required contribution would be delayed beyond 2010. If plan assets depreciate between now and 2010, we could be required to make contributions sooner than 2010. We expect to continue to make cash contributions to our other pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2007. The expected 2007 contribution is approximately $26.6 million, compared to $33.7 million in 2006. In addition, we expect to make benefit payments related to our postretirement benefit plan of approximately $12.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $11.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. See the Contractual Obligations table above for projected contributions and benefit payments beyond 2007. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Related Party Transactions We do not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off balance sheet arrangements except for those disclosed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Additionally, we have not engaged in any significant related party transactions. 59 Table of Contents Forward Looking Statements We may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in reports to shareholders and in press releases and investor Web casts. These forward looking statements can be identified by the use of words like anticipates, aspirations, believes, continues, estimates, expects, goals, guidance, intends, plans, projects, strategy, targets, will and other words of similar meaning. They can also be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and whether to invest in, or remain invested in, our securities. In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying in the following paragraphs important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements: We rely significantly on third parties to support critical components of our business model in a continuous and high quality manner, including third party data providers, strategic partners in our D&B Worldwide Network, and outsourcing partners; Demand for our products is subject to intense competition, changes in customer preferences and, to a lesser extent, economic conditions which impact customer behavior; The profitability of our International segment depends on our ability to identify and execute on various initiatives, such as the implementation of subscription plan pricing and successfully managing our D&B Worldwide Network, and our ability to identify and contend with various challenges present in foreign markets, such as local competition and the availability of public records at no cost; Our ability to renew large contracts, the related revenue recognition and the timing thereof may impact our results of operations from period to period; Our results are subject to the effects of foreign economies, exchange rate fluctuations, legislative or regulatory requirements, such as the adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices, including pronouncements by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies, and the implementation or modification of fees or taxes that we must pay to acquire, use, and or redistribute data. In particular, our results have been, and may continue to be, significantly impacted by legislative changes affecting the fees charged by the Italian government to acquire and or re use data. Our solutions and brand image are dependent upon the integrity of our global database and the continued availability thereof through the internet and by other means, as well as our ability to protect key assets, such as data center capacity; We are involved in various tax matters and legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are unknown and uncertain with respect to the impact on our cash flow and profitability; Our ability to successfully implement our Blueprint for Growth Strategy requires that we successfully reduce our expense base through our Financial Flexibility Program, and reallocate certain of the expense base reductions into initiatives that produce desired revenue growth; Our future success requires that we attract and retain qualified personnel in regions throughout the world; 60 Table of Contents Our ability to repurchase shares is subject to market conditions, including trading volume in our stock, and our ability to repurchase shares in accordance with applicable securities laws; Our ability to acquire and successfully integrate other complimentary businesses, products and technologies into our existing business, without significant disruption to our existing business or to our financial results; and Our projection for free cash flow in 2007 is dependent upon our ability to generate revenue, our collection processes, customer payment patterns, the timing and volume of stock option exercises and the amount and timing of payments related to the tax and other matters and legal proceedings in which we are involved. We elaborate on the above list of important factors throughout this document and in our other filings with the SEC, particularly in the discussion of our Risk Factors in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. It should be understood that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, the above list of important factors and the Risk Factors discussed in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on the Form 10 K should not be considered to be a complete discussion of all of our potential trends, risks and uncertainties. Except as otherwise required by federal securities laws, we do not undertake to update any forward looking statement we may make from time to time. Item 7A.
