Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations How We Manage Our Business For internal management purposes, we refer to core revenue, which we calculate as total operating revenue less the revenue of divested businesses. Core revenue is used to manage and evaluate the performance of our segments and to allocate resources because this measure provides an indication of the underlying changes in revenue in a single performance measure. Core revenue does not include reported revenue of divested businesses since they are not included in future revenue. On December 27, 2007, we completed the sale of our Italian real estate business which was a part of our International segment and we have reclassified the historical financial results of the Italian real estate business as discontinued operations as set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K to reflect this reclassification. The financial statements for our subsidiaries outside the U.S. and Canada reflect a fiscal year ended November 30, 2007, 2006, and 2005, in order to facilitate timely reporting of our consolidated financial results and financial position. Accordingly, the related assets and liabilities of our Italian real estate business have been classified as held for sale in the balance sheet and we will record the resulting gain from the sale in the first quarter of 2008. We also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because we believe it is useful for investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another, both with and without the effects of foreign exchange. As a result, we monitor our core revenue growth both after and before the effects of foreign exchange. Core revenue growth excluding the effects of foreign exchange is referred to as revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange. We have historically from time to time and we may continue to further analyze core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange among two components, organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions. We analyze organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions because management believes this information provides insight into the underlying health of our business. Core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange, and segment operating income growth before certain types of gains and charges that we consider do not reflect our underlying business performance. Specifically, for management reporting purposes, we evaluate segment performance before non core gains and charges because such charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations. A recurring component of non core gains and charges are our restructuring charges, which result from a foundational element of our growth strategy that we refer to as Financial Flexibility. Through Financial Flexibility, management identifies opportunities to improve the performance of the business in terms of quality, efficiency and cost, in order to generate savings primarily to invest for growth. Such charges are variable from period to period based upon actions identified and taken during each period. Management reviews operating results before such charges on a monthly basis and establishes internal budgets and forecasts based upon such measures. Management further establishes annual and long term compensation such as salaries, target cash bonuses and target equity compensation amounts based on such measures and a significant percentage weight is placed upon such measures in determining whether performance objectives have been achieved. Management believes that by eliminating restructuring charges from such financial measures, and by being overt to shareholders about the results of our operations excluding such charges, business leaders are provided incentives to recommend and execute actions that are in the best long term interests of our shareholders, rather than being influenced by the potential impact a charge in a particular period could have on their compensation. Additionally, transition costs (period costs such as consulting fees, costs of temporary employees, relocation costs and stay bonuses incurred to implement the Financial Flexibility component of our strategy) are reported as Corporate and Other expenses and are not allocated to our segments. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for financial information regarding our segments. 23 Table of Contents Similarly, when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole, we focus on results (such as operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, net income, tax rate (defined as provision for income taxes divided by income before income taxes) and diluted earnings per share) before non core gains and charges because such non core gains and charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations and may drive behavior that does not ultimately maximize shareholder value. It should not be concluded from our presentation of non core gains and charges that the items that result in non core gains and charges will not occur in the future. We also use free cash flow to manage our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles. Free cash flow measures our available cash flow for potential debt repayment, acquisitions, stock repurchases and additions to cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. We believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating the funding available after supporting our ongoing business operations and our portfolio of product investments. Free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute measure for, or superior to, net cash flows provided by operating activities, investing activities or financing activities. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our consolidated statements of cash flows. The adjustments discussed herein to our results as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods, to allocate resources, to evaluate business performance and, as noted above, for compensation purposes. However, these financial measures (results before non core gains and charges and free cash flow) are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue, operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, net income, tax rate, diluted earnings per share, or net cash provided by operating activities, investing activities and financing activities prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, it should be noted that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly or at all, the presentation of these financial measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies. See Results of Operations below for a discussion of our results reported on a GAAP basis. Overview We manage and report our operations under the following two segments: United States (U.S.); and International (which consists of operations in Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific and Latin America). The financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. and Canada reflect a fiscal year ended November 30 to facilitate the timely reporting of our consolidated financial results and financial position. Total revenue and core revenue were the same for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Therefore, our discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, references only our core revenue results. The following table presents the contribution by segment of core revenue results.

Financial Flexibility is an ongoing process by which we seek to reallocate our spending from low growth or low value activities to other activities that will create greater value for shareholders through enhanced revenue growth, improved profitability and or quality improvements. With each program we have incurred restructuring charges (which generally consists of employee severance and termination costs, contract terminations, asset write offs, and or costs to terminate lease obligations, less assumed sublease income) and transition costs (which consist of other costs necessary to accomplish the process changes such as consulting fees, costs of temporary workers, relocation costs and stay bonuses). An integral component of our strategy is creating financial flexibility to fund investments for growth and to create shareholder value. Through our Financial Flexibility Program we continually and systematically seek ways to improve our performance in terms of quality and cost. Specifically, we seek to eliminate, standardize, consolidate and automate our business functions. As a part of each program, we have incurred a restructuring charge, which generally consists of, among other things, employee severance and termination costs. We also have incurred transition costs, which generally consist of other costs necessary to accomplish the process changes such as consulting fees, cost of temporary workers, relocation costs and stay bonuses. Our 2008 Financial Flexibility Program, which was approved on January 24, 2008, builds on efforts initiated in 2007 to reduce significantly the complexity of our business, a process that we anticipate continuing over the next several years. Specifically, in 2008, we will continue to address complexity reduction and create financial flexibility through several initiatives including the following: Enhancing Organizational Effectiveness: this initiative is intended to reduce organizational complexity and improve the efficiency of how we are organized and how we operate as a business by continuing to address spans of control, consolidating like functions and eliminating non essential activities; Simplifying our Products and Technology: this initiative is intended to simplify the various platforms and products we offer our customers and moving to fewer and easier to use web based platforms like DNBi and Hoovers and eliminating and consolidating systems and technology infrastructure; Streamlining Data Collection and Product Ordering: this initiative is intended to standardize and automate processes to drive efficiencies and quality to support our overall DUNSRight data strategy; and Improving Overall Business Effectiveness: this initiative is intended to improve the efficiencies of our operations by centralizing management of key cost drivers, vendor consolidation and contract renegotiation. In addition, we are focusing on driving revenue growth by reducing the non selling time of our sales force, enhancing our new customer acquisition activities and go to market approaches. On an annualized basis, the actions under our 2008 Financial Flexibility Program are expected to create $75 million to $80 million of financial flexibility, of which approximately $60 million to $65 million will be generated in 2008, before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of savings generated by 26 Table of Contents the initiatives. We expect all actions under our 2008 program to be completed by December 2008. To implement these initiatives we expect to incur transition costs of approximately $13 million to $15 million in 2008. In addition, we expect to incur restructuring charges totaling $20 million to $25 million pre tax, of which $18 million to $23 million relate to severance, approximately $1 million relate to lease termination obligations and approximately $1 million relate to other exit costs in 2008. Approximately $30 million to $40 million of these transition costs and restructuring charges are expected to result in cash expenditures. As a result of this financial flexibility program we expect that approximately 300 350 positions will be eliminated globally. Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In preparing our consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances reflected therein, we have applied the significant accounting policies described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Of those policies, we consider the policies described below to be critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require managements subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If actual results in a given period ultimately differ from previous estimates, the actual results could have a material impact on such period. We have discussed the selection and application of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure regarding critical accounting policies and estimates as well as the other sections in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations We previously offered substantially all of our U.S. based employees coverage under a defined benefit plan called The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation Retirement Account (the U.S. Qualified Plan). The defined benefit plan covers active and retired employees including retired individuals from spin off companies (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further discussion of spin off companies). The benefits to be paid upon retirement are based on a percentage of the employees annual compensation. The percentage of compensation allocated annually to a retirement account ranges from 3% to 12.5%, based on age and service. Amounts allocated under the plan also receive interest credits based on the 30 year Treasury rate or equivalent rate published by the Internal Revenue Service. Pension costs are determined actuarially and funded in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. We also maintain supplemental and excess plans in the United States (the U.S. Non Qualified Plans) to provide additional retirement benefits to certain key employees of the Company. These plans are unfunded, pay as you go plans. The U.S. Qualified Plan and the U.S. Non Qualified Plans account for approximately 69% and 14% of our pension obligation, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Effective June 30, 2007, we amended the U.S. Qualified Plan and one of the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, known as the U.S. Pension Benefit Equalization Plan (the PBEP). Any pension benefit that had been accrued through such date under the two plans was frozen at its then current value and no additional benefits, other than interest on such amounts, will accrue under the U.S. Qualified Plan and the PBEP. Our employees in certain of our International operations are also provided retirement benefits through defined benefit plans, representing the remaining balance of our pension obligations. 27 Table of Contents We also provide various health care and life insurance benefits for retirees. U.S. based employees, who retire with 10 years of vesting service after age 45, are eligible to receive benefits. Postretirement benefit costs and obligations are determined actuarially. In accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, amended by SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, our pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial assumptions and methodologies. Other postretirement benefits (i.e., health care) are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, amended by SFAS No. 158, and are also dependent on the application of our assumptions by outside actuaries. The key assumptions used in the measurement of the pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement cost are: Expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets which is based on a target asset allocation as well as expected returns on asset categories of plan investments; Discount rate which is used to measure the present value of pension plan obligations and postretirement health care obligations. The discount rates are derived using a yield curve approach which matches projected plan benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans; Rates of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation/conversion rates which are based on an evaluation of internal plans and external market indicators; and Health care cost trends which are based on historical cost data, the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends. We believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, though changes in these assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The factor with the most immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements is a change in the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets for the U.S. Qualified Plan. For 2008, we will continue to use an expected long term rate of return of 8.25%. This assumption was 8.25%, 8.25% and 8.50% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 8.25% assumption represents our best estimate of the expected long term future investment performance of the U.S. Qualified Plan, after considering expectations for future capital market returns and the plans asset allocation. As of December 31, 2007, the plan was 65% invested in publicly traded equity securities, 29% invested in debt securities and 6% invested in real estate investments. Every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the long term rate of return increases or reduces our annual operating income by approximately $3.3 million by increasing or reducing our net periodic pension income. Changes in the discount rate, rate of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation/conversion rates also have an effect on our annual operating income. Based on the factors noted above, the discount rate is adjusted at each remeasurement date while other assumptions are reviewed annually. For our U.S. plans and Postretirement Benefit Plan, every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our pension cost and postretirement cost by approximately $4.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, for all of our U.S. pension plans and our Postretirement Benefit Plan, we increased the discount rate to 6.37% and 6.11% from 5.84% and 5.64% used at December 31, 2006, respectively. Differences between the assumptions stated above and actual experience could affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise in accordance with SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106, as amended by SFAS No. 158. These gains and losses are aggregated and amortized generally over the average future service periods of employees to the extent that such gains or losses exceed a corridor as defined in SFAS No. 87. The purpose of the corridor is to reduce the volatility caused by the difference between actual experience and the pension related assumptions noted above, on a plan by plan basis. For all of our pension plans, total actuarial losses that have not been recognized in our pension costs as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $378.8 million and $503.8 million, respectively, of 28 Table of Contents which $220.1 million and $274.5 million, respectively, were attributable to the U.S. Qualified Plan, $77.4 million and $98.1 million, respectively, were attributable to the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, and the remainder was attributable to the non U.S. pension plans. (See discussion in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.) We expect to recognize a portion of such losses in our 2008 net periodic pension cost of approximately $10.0 million, $4.9 million and $2.5 million, for the U.S. Qualified Plan, U.S. Non Qualified Plans and non U.S. plans, respectively, compared to $14.3 million, $5.4 million and $3.8 million, respectively, in 2007. The lower amortization of actuarial loss in 2008 of $4.3 million and $0.5 million related to the U.S. Qualified Plan and the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, respectively, which will be included in our pension cost in 2008, is primarily due to lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses exceeding the corridor threshold under SFAS No. 87 at January 1, 2008, primarily resulting from higher discount rates applied to the pension plans at December 31, 2007 as discussed above. Differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could affect our net periodic pension cost. We recorded net periodic pension cost for our pension plans of $10.7 million, $27.0 million and $13.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A major component of the net periodic pension cost is the expected return on plan assets, which was $117.1 million, $113.5 million and $119.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The expected return on plan assets was determined by multiplying the expected long term rate of return assumption by the market related value of plan assets. The market related value of plan assets recognizes asset gains and losses over five years to reduce the effects of short term market fluctuations on net periodic pension cost. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded investment gains of $105.7 million, $175.5 million and $112.6 million, respectively, in our pension plans, of which $91.2 million, $157.1 million and $90.2 million, respectively, were attributable to the U.S. Qualified Plan and $14.6 million, $18.4 million and $22.4 million, respectively, were attributable to the non U.S. plans. At January 1, 2008, the market related value of plan assets of our U.S. Qualified Plan and the non U.S. plans was $1,358.1 million and $201.5 million, respectively, compared with the fair value of its plan assets of $1,371.6 million and $217.4 million, respectively. Changes in the funded status of our pension plans could result in fluctuation in our shareholders equity. We adopted SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006 and we are required to recognize the funded status of our benefit plans as a liability or an asset, on a plan by plan basis, with an offsetting adjustment to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, or AOCI, in shareholders equity, net of tax. Accordingly, the amounts recognized in equity represent unrecognized gains/losses and prior service costs. We recognized charges of $182.7 million, net of applicable deferred taxes, to our shareholders equity in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 158. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs included in the shareholders equity would be amortized out of equity based on an actuarial calculation each period. Gains and losses and prior service costs that arise during the year will be recognized as a component of comprehensive income which is a component of AOCI. We recorded a net income of $79.3 million in AOCI, net of applicable tax, in 2007 related to the actuarial gain/loss and prior service cost arising during the period and the amortization of such items. A change in the discount rate assumption could result in a change in the funded status of our benefit plans by changing the amount of the benefit obligation. For the U.S. Qualified Plan, every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our projected benefit obligation by approximately $34.2 million. For the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our projected benefit obligation by approximately $6.5 million. For information on pension and postretirement benefit plan contribution requirements, please see Future Liquidity Sources and Uses of Funds Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefit Plan Contribution Requirements. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for more information regarding costs of, and assumptions for, our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs. 29 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation programs are described more fully in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payments, or SFAS No. 123R, which revises SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, or APB No. 25, using the Modified Prospective method. Under the Modified Prospective method, compensation cost associated with the stock option programs recognized for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 includes (a) compensation cost for stock options granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for stock options granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value under SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R also requires us to estimate future forfeitures in calculating the expense relating to stock based compensation as opposed to only recognizing these forfeitures and the corresponding reductions in expense as they occur. As a result, we have adjusted for this cumulative effect and recognized a pre tax reduction in stock based compensation of $0.5 million related to our restricted stock and restricted stock unit programs during the first quarter of 2006. As required under the Modified Prospective method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we applied APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for our plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized for grants under the stock option programs and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) prior to January 1, 2006. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option valuation model. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility rate of our common stock. Beginning in 2006, the expected term was determined using the simplified method for estimating the expected option life, as prescribed under Staff Accounting Bulletin or SAB No. 107, Share Based Payments, or SAB No. 107. The risk free interest rate for the corresponding expected term of the stock option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. We estimate the amount of stock based awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting. For stock options granted prior to SFAS No. 123R, the compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. For stock options granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the vesting period or the period from the grant date to the date when retirement eligibility is achieved. If factors change we may decide to use different assumptions under the Black Scholes option valuation model in the future, which could materially affect our share based compensation expense, operating income, net income and earnings per share. In connection with our dividend payments, we updated our dividend yield assumption in our Black Scholes valuation model from 0% for the year ended December 31, 2006 to 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007, in calculating the fair value of our employee stock options. We have estimated the dividend yield assumption by dividing the anticipated annual dividend payment by the stock price on the grant date. Contingencies and Litigation We establish reserves in connection with tax and legal proceedings, claims and litigation when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time. Estimating probable losses requires analyses of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments concerning potential actions by third parties and regulators. This is an inherently subjective and complex process, and actual results may differ from our estimates by material amounts. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 30 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Our Risk Management Solutions are generally sold under fixed price subscription contracts that allow those customers unlimited use within predefined ranges, subject to certain conditions. In these instances, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract, which is generally one year. For arrangements that include periodic updates to that information file over the contract term, the portion of the revenue related to updates expected to be delivered is deferred as a liability on the balance sheet and recognized as the updates are delivered, usually on a quarterly or monthly basis. We also have monthly or annual contracts that enable a customer to purchase our information solutions during the period of contract at prices per an agreed price list, up to the contracted dollar limit. Revenue on these contracts is recognized as solutions are delivered to the customer, based on the per solution price. Any additional solutions purchased over this limit may be subject to pricing variations and revenue is recognized as the solutions are delivered. If customers do not use the full value of their contract and forfeit the unused portion, we recognize the forfeited amount as revenue at contract expiration. Revenue related to services provided over the contract term, such as monitoring services, is recognized ratably over the contract period, which is typically one year. For Sales & Marketing Solutions and Supply Management Solutions, we generally recognize revenue upon delivery of the information file to the customer. For arrangements that include periodic updates to that information file over the contract term, the portion of the revenue related to updates expected to be delivered is deferred as a liability on the balance sheet and recognized as the updates are delivered, usually on a quarterly or monthly basis. For subscription solutions that provide continuous access to our generic marketing information and business reference databases, as well as any access fees or hosting fees related to enabling customers access to our information, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically one year. We have certain solution offerings that are sold as multi element arrangements. The multiple elements may include information files, file updates for certain solutions, software, services, trademarks and or other intangibles. Revenue for each element is recognized when that element is delivered to the customer, based upon the relative fair value for each element. For offerings that include software that is considered to be more than incidental, we recognize revenue when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed and the software has been shipped and installed. Maintenance revenue, which consists of fees for ongoing support and software updates, is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically one year, when the maintenance for the software is considered significant. When maintenance is insignificant, we recognize the revenue when the agreement is signed and the software is shipped. Revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the services are performed. Our E Business Solutions consists of Hoovers, Inc., which includes Hoovers, First Research division and AllBusiness.com, Inc. Hoovers and First Research provide subscription solutions that allow continuous access to our business information databases. Revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is generally one year. Any additional solutions purchased are recognized upon delivery to the customer. AllBusiness.com provides online media and e commerce products that provide advertisers the ability to target small business customers. Revenue is recognized as solutions are delivered to the customer over the contract period. Amounts billed in advance are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet as deferred revenue and are recognized as the services are performed. 31 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for disclosure of the impact that recently issued accounting standards may have on our audited consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements. They should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes set forth in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Consolidated Revenue The following table presents our revenue by segment: For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Revenue: U.S. $ 1,248.3 $ 1,164.2 $ 1,087.8 International 350.9 310.7 292.2 Core Revenue $ 1,599.2 $ 1,474.9 $ 1,380.0 The following table presents our revenue by customer solution set: For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Revenue: Risk Management Solutions $ 981.0 $ 929.1 $ 889.6 Sales & Marketing Solutions 459.5 412.2 382.8 E Business Solutions 107.5 88.7 70.0 Supply Management Solutions 51.2 44.9 37.6 Core Revenue $ 1,599.2 $ 1,474.9 $ 1,380.0 Year ended December 31, 2007 vs. Year ended December 31, 2006 Core revenue increased $124.3 million, or 8% (7% increase before the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was driven by an increase in total U.S. revenue of $84.1 million, or 7%, and an increase in total International revenue of $40.2 million, or 13% (5% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). Our acquisitions contributed one percentage point of this growth for year ended December 31, 2007. This $124.3 million increase is primarily attributed to: Higher purchases from our existing customers; The positive impact of foreign exchange; Growth in each of our subscription plans for our Preferred Pricing Agreement and for our Preferred Pricing Agreement with DNBi from existing customers willing to increase the level of business they do with us; 32 Table of Contents Continued growth in subscription revenue at Hoovers; and Higher levels of project oriented business in our Sales & Marketing Solutions; partially offset by: Decreased usage in the UK market, primarily as a result of lower product usage from a key global customer. Customer Solution Set On a customer solution set basis, the $124.3 million increase in core revenue reflects: A $51.9 million, or 6%, increase in Risk Management Solutions (4% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $27.0 million, or 4%, and growth in International of $24.9 million, or 10% (2% increase before the effect of foreign exchange); A $47.3 million, or 12%, increase in Sales & Marketing Solutions (10% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $33.7 million, or 10%, and an increase in International of $13.6 million, or 24% (16% increase before the effect of foreign exchange); An $18.8 million, or 21%, increase in E Business Solutions (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $17.2 million, or 21%, and growth in International of $1.6 million, or 29% (20% increase before the effect of foreign exchange); and A $6.3 million, or 14%, increase in Supply Management Solutions (13% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $6.2 million, or 15%, and an increase in International of $0.1 million, or 2% (7% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange). Year ended December 31, 2006 vs. Year ended December 31, 2005 Core revenue increased $94.9 million, or 7% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in core revenue was primarily driven by an increase in total U.S. revenue of $76.4 million, or 7%, and an increase in total International revenue of $18.5 million, or 6% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). This $94.9 million increase is primarily attributed to: Growth in our Risk Management Solutions in the U.S. primarily related to growth in each of our subscription plans for Preferred Pricing Agreement and for Preferred Pricing Agreement with DNBi, from existing customers willing to increase the level of business they do with us; Increased demand from our existing customer base in our Sales & Marketing Solutions; Growth in our E Business Solutions, representing the results of Hoovers, Inc. The increase was primarily due to continued growth in subscription revenue; and Growth in our Supply Management Solutions, primarily in the U.S., due to new customers and includes eleven percentage points of growth as a result of the acquisition of Open Ratings in the first quarter of 2006; partially offset by: A decline in revenue resulting from an expiration of both a five year licensing arrangement and an outsourcing arrangement with Receivable Management Services, Inc., in April 2006. 33 Table of Contents Customer Solution Set On a customer solution set basis, the $94.9 million increase in core revenue reflects: A $39.5 million, or 5%, increase in Risk Management Solutions (4% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $29.0 million, or 4%, and growth in International of $10.5 million, or 5% (4% increase before the effect of foreign exchange); A $29.4 million, or 8%, increase in Sales & Marketing Solutions (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $24.3 million, or 7%, and an increase in International of $5.1 million, or 10% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange); An $18.7 million, or 27%, increase in E Business Solutions (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $16.0 million, or 24%, and an increase in International of $2.7 million, or 97% (96% increase before the effect of foreign exchange); and A $7.3 million, or 19%, increase in Supply Management Solutions (20% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $7.1 million, or 21%, and growth in International of $0.2 million, or 3% (4% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). Consolidated Operating Costs The following table presents our consolidated operating costs and operating income: For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Operating Expenses $ 430.4 $ 410.9 $ 355.8 Selling and Administrative Expenses 671.5 612.7 594.3 Depreciation and Amortization 46.6 32.1 34.6 Restructuring Charge 25.1 25.5 30.7 Operating Costs $ 1,173.6 $ 1,081.2 $ 1,015.4 Operating Income $ 425.6 $ 393.7 $ 364.6 As described above in the section Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations How We Manage Our Business, when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole, we focus on our operating income (and, therefore, operating costs) before non core gains and charges, because we do not view these items as reflecting our underlying business operations. We have identified under the caption Non Core Gains and (Charges) below, such non core gains and charges that are included in our GAAP results. Operating Expenses Year ended December 31, 2007 vs. Year ended December 31, 2006 Operating expenses increased by $19.5 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to the following: Costs associated with investments in DNBi, our interactive, web based subscription service, our investments in our DUNSRight Quality Process and our investments to enhance our strategic capabilities, such as with Acxiom Corporation (Acxiom), in order to significantly increase the speed, data processing capacity and matching capabilities we provide our U.S. sales and marketing customers; The impact of foreign exchange; and Increased technology costs arising from obligations under our D&B Worldwide Network agreements; 34 Table of Contents partially offset by: Lower costs as a result of our reengineering efforts. Year ended December 31, 2006 vs. Year ended December 31, 2005 Operating expenses increased by $55.1 million, or 16%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to the following: Costs associated with investments in connection with our strategy, such as Acxiom and our DUNSRight Quality Process as well as investments in DNBi; Higher pension costs and lower postretirement benefit income (see section Pension, Postretirement and Profit Participation Plan below for further discussion); Increased costs associated with the acquisition of Open Ratings in the first quarter of 2006; and The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R (see section Stock Based Compensation below for further discussion); partially offset by: Lower costs as a result of our reengineering efforts; and The impact of foreign exchange. Selling and Administrative Expenses Year ended December 31, 2007 vs. Year ended December 31, 2006 Selling and administrative expenses increased $58.8 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to the following: Increased selling expenses primarily related to costs associated with investments to enhance our strategic capabilities, such as with our Huaxia/D&B China joint venture or Huaxia/D&B China Joint Venture and our recent acquisitions; and The impact of foreign exchange; partially offset by: Lower costs as a result of our reengineering efforts. Year ended December 31, 2006 vs. Year ended December 31, 2005 Selling and administrative expenses increased $18.4 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to the following: Additional costs related to investments as well as additional variable costs (such as commissions) incurred as a result of increased revenues; Higher pension costs and lower postretirement benefit income (see section Pension, Postretirement and Profit Participation Plan below for further discussion); and The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R (see section Stock Based Compensation below for further discussion); partially offset by: Lower costs as a result of our reengineering efforts; 35 Table of Contents Increased costs in 2005 related to the investigation and final resolution of the dispute on the sale of our French business with no comparable costs in 2006 and lower legal costs generally in 2006; and The impact of foreign exchange. Matters Impacting Both Operating Expenses and Selling and Administrative Expenses Pension, Postretirement and Profit Participation Plan We had a net pension cost of $10.7 million, $27.0 million and $13.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, for our pension plans globally. The fluctuation in the pension cost was due to the following: Lower pension costs in 2007 were primarily due to the elimination of service costs as a result of the pension plan freeze in the U.S. for the U.S. Qualified Plan and PBEP effective June 30, 2007. Actuarial loss amortization included in annual pension expense as required by SFAS No. 87 and the impact of the discount rates were also major factors in driving the pension costs to fluctuate from year to year. The higher the discount rate, the lower the pension cost. Actuarial loss amortization included in annual pension expense for all global plans was $23.5 million, $31.5 million and $25.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, of which $19.7 million, $29.2 million and $23.3 million were attributable to our U.S. plans for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Lastly, a decrease in the long term rate of return assumption for our U.S. Qualified Plan also contributed to the increase in expense from 2005 to 2006. The long term rate of return assumptions were 8.25%, 8.25% and 8.50% for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the pension costs for our U.S. plans for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 5.84%, 5.50% and 5.65%, respectively. We expect that the net pension income in 2008 will be approximately $2.4 million for all of our global pension plans. The decrease in pension cost or increase in pension income from 2007 to 2008 is primarily driven by a 53 basis points and 100 basis points increase in the discount rate applied to our U.S. plans and the major International plans, respectively, at January 1, 2008 and lower actuarial loss amortization included in 2008. We had postretirement benefit income of $3.5 million, $3.5 million and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Lower postretirement benefit income for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005, was primarily due to lower negative prior service cost amortizations recognized in 2007 and 2006 included in postretirement benefit income due to the accelerated recognition of prior service cost as a one time curtailment gain in 2005 associated with the 2005 and 2004 Financial Flexibility Programs. The curtailment gain is included within Restructuring Charges. We expect postretirement benefit income will be approximately $3.5 million in 2008. We had expense associated with our profit participation plan (401(k) Plan) of $12.0 million, $7.0 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in expense in 2007 was due to the amendment of our matching policy in the profit participation plan effective July 1, 2007, to increase our match formula from 50% to 100% of a team members contributions and to increase the maximum match to seven percent (7%) from six percent (6%), of such team members eligible compensation, subject to certain 401(k) Plan limitations. We consider net pension cost and postretirement benefit income to be part of our compensation costs, and, therefore, they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses, based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs. See the discussion of Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations, above, and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 36 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R, which requires us to recognize stock based compensation for our stock option programs and ESPP. We have selected the modified prospective method and, therefore, prior periods have not been restated. Prior to January 1, 2006, we applied APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option programs. Accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized for grants under the stock option programs or the ESPP. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized total stock based compensation expense of $25.9 million, $20.8 million and $11.9 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we recognized expense associated with our stock option programs of $11.9 million and $12.7 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to fewer unvested stock options outstanding expensed in 2007 partially offset by fewer forfeitures associated with fewer terminated employees in 2007 as compared to 2006. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized expense associated with restricted stock, restricted stock unit and restricted stock opportunity awards of $13.1 million, $7.1 million (net of $0.5 million related to the accumulated effect of forfeiture assumptions) and $11.8 million, respectively. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to the addition of the 2007 grant, fewer forfeitures associated with fewer terminated employees in 2007 as compared to 2006 and a cumulative accounting adjustment included in the three months ended March 31, 2006 expense to reflect adjustments to previously recognized compensation expense for awards outstanding at the adoption date of SFAS No. 123R that we do not expect to vest. For each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we recognized expense associated with our ESPP of $0.9 million. We recognized expense associated with our stock appreciation rights of approximately $0.1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. We consider these costs to be part of our compensation costs and, therefore, they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses, based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs. Depreciation and Amortization Year ended December 31, 2007 vs. Year ended December 31, 2006 Depreciation and amortization increased $14.5 million, or 45%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily driven by the increased capital costs in investments to enhance our strategic capabilities and amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions. Year ended December 31, 2006 vs. Year ended December 31, 2005 Depreciation and amortization decreased $2.5 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005. This decrease was primarily driven by the reduced capital requirements in our business in prior years, which was partially offset by increased costs in investments as well as capital costs for newly leased facilities. Restructuring Charge During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a $23.1 million restructuring charge in connection with the Financial Flexibility Program announced in January 2007 (2007 Financial Flexibility Program), a $1.5 million restructuring charge in connection with the Financial Flexibility Program announced in February 37 Table of Contents 2006 (2006 Financial Flexibility Program) and a $0.5 million restructuring charge in connection with the Financial Flexibility Program announced in February 2005 (2005 Financial Flexibility Program).

In accordance with SFAS No. 106, we were required to recognize immediately a pro rata portion of the unrecognized prior service cost as a result of the employee terminations. At December 31, 2006, all actions under the 2006 Financial Flexibility Program were substantially completed. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a $30.8 million restructuring charge in connection with the 2005 Financial Flexibility Program and a $0.1 million net restructuring gain in connection with the 2004 Financial Flexibility Program. The components of these charges and gains included: Severance and termination costs of $23.3 million associated with approximately 425 employees related to the 2005 Financial Flexibility Program. Of these 425 employees, 400 employees have exited the Company and 25 employees exited the Company in future quarters; Severance and termination costs of $5.7 million associated with approximately 310 employees related to the 2004 Financial Flexibility Program. Of these 310 employees, 300 employees have exited the Company and 10 employees exited the Company in future quarters; Lease termination obligations, other costs to consolidate or close facilities and other exit costs of $4.7 million related to the 2005 Financial Flexibility Program; 38 Table of Contents Curtailment charges of $3.1 million related to our pension plans and an immediate reduction to ongoing pension income of $3.4 million related to the U.S. Qualified Plan resulting from employee actions for the 2005 Financial Flexibility Program. In accordance with SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 88, we were required to recognize immediately a pro rata portion of the unrecognized prior service cost as a result of the employee terminations, and the pension plan was required to be re measured which reduced our periodic pension income; and Curtailment gains of $3.7 million and $5.8 million related to the U.S. postretirement benefit plan resulting from employee actions for the 2005 Financial Flexibility Program and 2004 Financial Flexibility Program, respectively. In accordance with SFAS No. 106, we were required to recognize immediately a pro rata portion of the unrecognized prior service cost as a result of the employee terminations. As of December 31, 2007, we have eliminated approximately 5,675 positions which included 625 open positions, and approximately 5,050 employees (via attrition and termination) under all of our Financial Flexibility Programs. Interest Income (Expense) Net The following table presents our Interest Income (Expense) Net: For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Interest Income $ 7.3 $ 7.3 $ 10.6 Interest Expense (28.3 ) (20.3 ) (21.1 ) Interest Income (Expense) Net $ (21.0 ) $ (13.0 ) $ (10.5 ) Interest income remained flat at $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, primarily due to fewer interest bearing investments during the year ended December 31, 2007, offset by higher interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2007. Interest income decreased $3.3 million, or 31%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005, primarily due to fewer interest bearing investments during the year ended December 31, 2006, partially offset by higher interest rates. Interest expense increased by $8.0 million, or 39%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006, primarily attributable to higher outstanding borrowings on our credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by lower interest rates associated with our $300 million fixed rate notes that we issued in March 2006 compared to higher interest rates associated with our $300 million fixed rate notes that matured in March 2006 (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Interest expense decreased by $0.8 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005, primarily due to lower interest rates associated with our $300 million fixed rate notes that we issued in March 2006 compared to higher interest rates associated with our $300 million fixed rate notes that matured in March 2006 (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K), partially offset by higher outstanding borrowings on our credit facility during 2006. 39 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) Net The following table presents the components of Other Income (Expense) Net: For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Miscellaneous Other Income (Expense) Net(a) $ 1.8 $ (0.3 ) $ 0.2 Gain associated with Huaxia/D&B China Joint Venture(b) 5.8 Gain associated with Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture(c) 13.2 Net Gain (Loss) on the Sale of Other Investments 0.9 3.5 Final Resolution of All Disputes on the Sale of our French Business (3.7 ) Lower Costs Related to the Sale of the Iberian Business 0.8 Other Income (Expense) Net $ 21.7 $ (0.3 ) $ 0.8 (a) Miscellaneous Other Income (Expense) Net increased for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to Legacy Tax Matters.

In addition, basic and diluted EPS were impacted by our repurchases of 3.8 million shares of common stock for $287.7 million under our Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs to mitigate the dilutive effect of shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. 41 Table of Contents Non Core Gains and (Charges) For internal management purposes, we treat certain gains and charges that are included in Consolidated Operating Costs, Other Income (Expense) Net and Provision for Income Taxes as non core gains and charges. These non core gains and charges are summarized in the table below. We exclude non core gains and charges when evaluating our financial performance because we do not consider these items to reflect our underlying business performance. For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Non Core gains and (charges) included in Consolidated Operating Costs: Restructuring charges related to our Financial Flexibility Programs $ (25.1 ) $ (25.5 ) $ (30.7 ) Settlement of International payroll tax matter related to a divested entity $ (0.8 ) $ $ Final resolution of all disputes on the sale of our French business $ $ $ (0.4 ) Non Core gains and (charges) included in Other Income (Expense) Net: Effect of Legacy Tax Matters $ 1.6 $ $ Gain associated with Huaxia/D&B China Joint Venture $ 5.8 $ $ Gain associated with Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture $ 13.2 $ $ Net Gain (Loss) on the Sale of Other Investments $ 0.9 $ $ 3.5 Final resolution of all disputes on the sale of our French business $ $ $ (3.7 ) Lower costs related to the sale of our operations in Iberia (Spain and Portugal) $ $ $ 0.8 Non Core gains and (charges) included in Provision for Income Taxes: Tax charge related to our repatriation of foreign cash $ $ $ (9.3 ) Tax Reserve True up for the Settlement of 1997 2002 tax years, primarily related to the Amortization of Royalty Expense/Deductions/Royalty Income 1997 2007 transaction $ 31.2 $ $ Charge/Increase in Legacy Tax Reserve for Royalty Expense Deductions 1993 1997 $ $ (0.8 ) $ (6.3 ) Tax Benefits recognized upon the liquidation of dormant International entities $ $ $ 16.3 Net Gain (Loss) on the Sale of Other Investments $ (0.3 ) $ $ (1.5 ) Restructuring charges related to our Financial Flexibility Programs $ 9.4 $ 8.6 $ 8.1 Effect of Legacy Tax Matters $ (1.6 ) $ $ Settlement of International payroll tax matter related to a divested entity $ 0.2 $ $ Gain associated with Huaxia/D&B China Joint Venture $ (2.9 ) $ $ Gain associated with Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture $ (8.3 ) $ $ Impact of revaluing the Net Deferred Tax Assets in the UK as a result of a UK tax law change, enacted in the third quarter of 2007, which reduces the general UK tax rate from 30% to 28% $ (2.5 ) $ $ Final resolution of all disputes on the sale of our French business $ $ $ 1.5 Tax Legacy Refund for Utilization of Capital Losses 1989 1990 $ $ $ 0.9 Segment Results The operating segments reported below are our segments for which separate financial information is available and upon which operating results are evaluated by management on a timely basis to assess performance and to allocate resources. Our results are reported under the following two segments: U.S. and International. U.S. The U.S. is our largest segment representing 78% of our core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007, and 79% of our core revenue for each of the years ending December 31, 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents The following table presents our U.S. core revenue by customer solution set and U.S. operating income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Revenue: Risk Management Solutions $ 711.7 $ 684.7 $ 655.7 Sales & Marketing Solutions 389.5 355.8 331.5 E Business Solutions 100.4 83.2 67.2 Supply Management Solutions 46.7 40.5 33.4 Core U.S. Revenue $ 1,248.3 $ 1,164.2 $ 1,087.8 Operating Income $ 466.0 $ 425.8 $ 405.5 Year ended December 31, 2007 vs. Year ended December 31, 2006 U.S. Overview U.S. core revenue increased $84.1 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase reflects growth in all of our customer solution sets. U.S. Customer Solution Sets On a customer solution set basis, the $84.1 million increase in core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, reflects: Risk Management Solutions A $27.0 million, or 4%, increase in Risk Management Solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Traditional Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 77% of total U.S. Risk Management Solutions, increased 5%. The primary drivers of this growth were: Continued growth of our Preferred Pricing Agreement with DNBi subscription plans from existing customers who are willing to increase the level of business they do with us, including the customers who previously purchased value added solutions. These subscription plans provide our customers with unlimited use of our Risk Management reports and data, within pre defined ranges, provided such customers commit to an increased level of spend from their historical levels; and Higher purchase commitments from existing customers; partially offset by: A decrease in purchases of our older legacy solutions primarily due to our customers shifting to our subscription plan solutions; and The expiration in April 2006 of our five year licensing arrangement with Receivable Management Services, Inc. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Value Added Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 23% of total U.S. Risk Management Solutions, increased 1%. The primary drivers of this growth were: Higher purchases from our existing customers; 43 Table of Contents partially offset by: A shift in product mix to our Preferred Pricing Agreement with DNBi subscription plans (as noted above); and A decline in revenue as a result of the expiration in April 2006 of a five year outsourcing arrangement entered into in connection with the five year licensing arrangement referenced above. We believe that we will continue to experience a greater percentage of sales on new solutions where revenue will be recognized in subsequent quarters. As a result, we believe that quarterly revenue will continue to be positively impacted by the recognition of deferred revenue from prior quarter sales, offset by the deferral of revenue from current sales into subsequent periods. Sales & Marketing Solutions A $33.7 million, or 10%, increase in Sales & Marketing Solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Traditional Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 39% of total U.S. Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 3%. The increase was primarily driven by higher commitments from our existing customers, new customer acquisitions and revenue associated with our acquisition of the Education Division of Automation Research, Inc. d/b/a MKTG Services, which provided one percentage point of growth. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Value Added Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 61% of total U.S. Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 14%. The increase was primarily driven by higher purchases from our existing customers resulting from our global business marketing information database powered by Acxioms grid computing platform. E Business Solutions A $17.2 million, or 21%, increase in E Business Solutions, primarily representing the results of Hoovers. The increase was driven by continued growth in subscription revenue at Hoovers and six percentage points of growth associated with our acquisition of First Research and AllBusiness.com, Inc. Supply Management Solutions A $6.2 million, or 15%, increase in Supply Management Solutions, on a small base. The increase was primarily driven by increased commitments from an existing customer base, and revenue associated with our acquisition of Open Ratings. The acquisition of Open Ratings contributed two percentage points of growth. U.S. Operating Income U.S. operating income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $466.0 million, compared to $425.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $40.2 million, or 10%. The increase in operating income was primarily attributed to: An increase in U.S. revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007; partially offset by: Increased costs associated with our strategic investments; and Increased costs associated with our recent acquisitions. 44 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2006 vs. Year ended December 31, 2005 U.S. Overview U.S. core revenue increased $76.4 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is due to increased revenue in all of our customer solution sets. U.S. Customer Solution Sets On a customer solution set basis, the $76.4 million increase in core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects: Risk Management Solutions A $29.0 million, or 4%, increase in Risk Management Solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Traditional Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 76% of total U.S. Risk Management Solutions, increased 4%. There were two main drivers of this growth: Continued growth of each of our Preferred Pricing Agreement and Preferred Pricing Agreement with DNBi subscription plans, from existing customers who are willing to increase the level of business they do with us. These subscription plans provide our customers with unlimited use of our Risk Management reports and data, within pre defined ranges, provided such customers commit to an increased level of spend from their historical levels; and Higher purchases from our existing customers; partially offset by: The expiration in April 2006 of our five year licensing arrangement with Receivable Management Services, Inc. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Value Added Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 24% of total U.S. Risk Management Solutions, increased 7%. The primary drivers of this growth were: New customer acquisitions and higher purchases from our existing customers; partially offset by: A decline in revenue as a result of an expiration in April 2006 of a five year arrangement entered into in connection with the five year licensing arrangement referenced above; and A shift in product mix to some of our newer value added products where a larger portion of revenue is recognized over the term of the contract versus up front, at signing. Sales & Marketing Solutions A $24.3 million, or 7%, increase in Sales & Marketing Solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Traditional Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 41% of total U.S. Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 3%.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, Value Added Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 59% of total U.S. Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 11%. The increase was primarily driven by increased demand from our existing customer base. 45 Table of Contents E Business Solutions A $16.0 million, or 24%, increase in E Business Solutions, representing the results of Hoovers, Inc. The increase was primarily due to continued growth in subscription revenue and increased advertising sales. Supply Management Solutions A $7.1 million, or 21%, increase in Supply Management Solutions, on a small base, due to new customers and includes twelve points of percentage growth associated with our Open Ratings acquisition. Operating Income U.S. operating income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $425.8 million, as compared to $405.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $20.3 million, or 5%. The increase in operating income was primarily attributed to: An increase in U.S. revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006; and Lower costs as result of our reengineering efforts; partially offset by: Costs associated with our investments such as Acxiom (which increases the speed, data processing capacity and matching capabilities we provide our U.S. sales and marketing customers); Higher pension costs and lower postretirement benefit income; The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R; The impact of increased costs associated with data purchases from our D&B Worldwide Network; and Increased costs associated with the acquisition of Open Ratings in the first quarter of 2006. International International represented 22% of our core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007, and 21% of our core revenue for each of the years ending December 31, 2006 and 2005. The following table presents our International revenue by customer solution set and International operating income.

Market Risk We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of certain of our investments. We employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies. We use short term foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge short term foreign currency denominated loans, investments and certain third party and intercompany transactions and, from time to time, we have used foreign exchange option contracts to reduce our International earnings exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, from time to time, we use interest rate instruments to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure on our outstanding fixed rate notes, as discussed under Interest Rate Risk below. A discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 50 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Management Our objective in managing exposure to interest rates is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on our earnings, cash flows and financial position, and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a policy that floating rate debt be managed within a minimum and maximum range of our total debt exposure. To manage our exposure, we may use fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and or interest rate swaps. On September 30, 2005 and February 10, 2006, we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of $200 million and $100 million, respectively. The objective of these hedges was to mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in Treasury rates in the anticipation of the below referenced debt issuance. These transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges, and as such, changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of debt issuance were recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. In connection with the issuance of senior notes (the 2011 notes), these interest rate derivative transactions were terminated, resulting in proceeds of approximately $5.0 million at the date of termination. The proceeds are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and will be amortized over the life of the 2011 notes. In connection with the $300 million, five year, fixed rate notes which matured in March 2006, we entered into fixed to floating (LIBOR rate indexed) interest rate swap agreements in the third quarter of 2001 with a notional principal amount totaling $100 million, and designated these swaps as fair value hedges against the long term, fixed rate notes. The arrangement was considered a highly effective hedge, and therefore the accounting for these hedges has no impact on earnings. The changes in the fair value of the hedge and the designated portion of the notes were reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. In March 2006, we issued the 2011 notes, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 5.50%, payable semi annually. The proceeds were used to repay our existing $300 million notes, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.625%, which matured on March 15, 2006. The swap agreements also expired in March 2006 contemporaneous with the note repayment. In January 2008, we entered into a series of rate locks with a notional value of $400 million to hedge treasury rate volatility in anticipation of a future debt issuance. At December 31, 2006, we had a $300 million bank revolving credit facility available at prevailing short term interest rates, which we terminated on April 19, 2007, and then entered into a new $500 million, five year bank revolving credit facility, which expires in April 2012. Borrowings under the $500 million credit facility are available at prevailing short term interest rates. At December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, we had $425.3 million and $159.5 million of floating rate debt outstanding under the $500 million facility and $300 million facility, respectively. A 0.1 basis point increase/decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt during the year ended December 31, 2007, would result in an incremental increase/decrease in annual interest expense of approximately $2.8 million. On January 25, 2008, we exercised a $150 million expansion feature on our $500 million credit facility expanding the total facility to $650 million. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Foreign Exchange Risk Management We have numerous offices in countries outside the U.S. and conduct operations in various countries through minority equity investments and strategic relationships with local players. Our International operations generated approximately 22% and 21% of our core revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 35% and 31% of our assets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were located outside the U.S. Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings, cash flows and financial position of our International operations. We follow a policy of hedging balance sheet positions denominated in currencies other than the functional 51 Table of Contents currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries. In addition, we are subject to foreign exchange risk associated with our International earnings and investments. We use short term, foreign exchange forward and option contracts to implement our hedging strategies. Typically, these contracts have maturities of twelve months or less. These contracts are executed with creditworthy institutions and are denominated primarily in the British pound sterling, the Euro and Canadian dollar. The gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with the balance sheet positions hedge are recorded in Other Income (Expense) Net in our consolidated financial statements and are essentially offset by the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency transactions. In addition, the gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with net investment hedges, if any, are recorded as cumulative translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in our consolidated financial statements. As in prior years, we have hedged substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries with short term forward foreign exchange contracts. In addition, from time to time, we use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain foreign earnings and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain net investment positions. The underlying transactions and the corresponding forward exchange and option contracts are mark to market at the end of each quarter and are reflected within our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, there were $54.1 million and $25.4 million in option contracts outstanding. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had a notional amount of approximately $185.4 million and $184.5 million, respectively, of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding that offset foreign currency denominated intercompany loans. Gains and losses associated with these contracts were $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007, $0.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006, and $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005. If exchange rates on average were to increase 10% from year end levels, without the benefit of having hedging activities, the unrealized loss would be approximately $15.1 million. If exchange rates on average were to decrease 10% from year end levels, without the benefit of having hedging activities, the unrealized gain would be approximately $18.4 million. However, the estimated potential gain and loss on these contracts is expected to be substantially offset by changes in the dollar value of the underlying transactions. Liquidity and Financial Position In connection with our focus on delivering Total Shareholder Return (TSR), we will remain disciplined in the use of our shareholders cash, maintaining three key priorities for the use of this cash: First, making ongoing investments in the business to drive growth; Second, acquisitions that we believe will be value accretive to enhance our capabilities and accelerate our growth; and Third, continuing to return cash to shareholders. We believe that cash provided by operating activities, supplemented as needed with readily available financing arrangements, is sufficient to meet our short term needs, including the cash cost of restructuring charges, transition costs, contractual obligations and contingencies (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K), excluding the legal matters identified in said note for which exposures cannot be estimated or are not probable. In addition, we believe that our ability to readily access the bank and capital markets for incremental financing needs will enable us to meet our continued focus on TSR. We have the ability to access the short term borrowings market from time to time to fund working capital needs, acquisitions and share repurchases. Such borrowings would be supported by our credit facility, when needed. 52 Table of Contents The following discussions are on a continuing operations basis and therefore exclude the results of the Italian real estate business. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Cash Provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations Net cash provided by operating activities was $384.6 million, $290.8 million and $261.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Year ended December 31, 2007 vs. Year ended December 31, 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $93.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily driven by: Increased net income of our underlying business excluding the impact of non cash gains and losses; Increased collections resulting from the timing of sales. Fourth quarter sales in 2007 occurred earlier in the quarter as compared to sales later in the fourth quarter of 2006; A lower SFAS 123R windfall reclassification from net cash flows from operating activities to cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, due to a decrease in the volume of stock option exercises in the current period; A decline in our other long term assets primarily due to a deposit made to the IRS in 2006 to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies related to the legacy tax matters discussed in Note 13 Contingencies (Tax Matters) to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K partially offset by higher 2007 pension income; and Timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities (e.g., royalty, relocation, our D&B Worldwide Network and data related expenses); partially offset by: An increase in restructuring payments compared to the prior period. Year ended December 31, 2006 vs. Year ended December 31, 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase was primarily driven by: Lower tax payments as a result of the settlement of a certain legacy tax matter in 2005; Increased net income of our underlying business excluding the impact of non cash gains and losses; An increase in deferred revenue resulting from higher sales and the collection of a third party receivable; and Lower restructuring payments compared to the prior period; partially offset by: An increase in our other long term assets in 2006 primarily due to a deposit made to the IRS in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies related to the legacy tax matters as discussed above; The implementation of SFAS No. 123R required the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax impact of recognized compensation expense to be reported as financing activities from continuing operations cash 53 Table of Contents flow, rather than as operating activities from continuing operations cash flow. As a result, this requirement reduced net operating activities from continuing operations cash flows and increased net financing activities from continuing operations cash flows by $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Included in the $39.6 million, was $19.2 million associated with the exercise of 1.0 million Moodys stock options; An increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2006 as well as the extension of longer terms to customers as compared to the prior year period; and A decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments. Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities from Continuing Operations Net cash used in investing activities was $216.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net cash used in investing activities was $52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Year ended December 31, 2007 vs. Year ended December 31, 2006 Net cash used in investing activities was $216.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $264.5 million decrease primarily reflects the following activities: During the year ended December 31, 2007, in connection with our initiatives to drive long term growth, we spent $146.5 million on acquisitions/joint ventures and other investments, net of cash acquired, as compared to $9.6 million, net of cash acquired, during the year ended December 31, 2006. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information; During the year ended December 31, 2006, we had net redemptions of marketable securities of $109.4 million. We did not have any investments or redemptions of marketable securities during the year ended December 31, 2007; and Capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles increased $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily driven by increased investments, such as DNBi, DUNSRight Quality Process and Acxiom in our U.S. segment and our capital investments, primarily for enhancements in the D&B Worldwide Network in our International segment. Year ended December 31, 2006 vs. Year ended December 31, 2005 Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with net cash used in investing activities of $52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The $100.3 million increase primarily reflects the following activities: During the year ended December 31, 2006, we had $109.4 million of net redemptions in short term marketable securities, as compared to a net increase in our investment in marketable securities of $26.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005; During the year ended December 31, 2006, we spent $9.6 million on acquisitions and other investments, net of cash acquired, compared to $16.8 million, net of cash acquired, during the year ended December 31, 2005; In 2005, we received net proceeds from divestitures and the sale of an investment in South Africa; and Capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles increased $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005. This increase was driven by our 54 Table of Contents U.S. segment due to increased investments in our DUNSRight Quality Process, DNBi, our interactive web based subscription products, as well as in our International segment, where the majority of capital investments were primarily for a new UK facility and the D&B Worldwide Network. Cash Used in Financing Activities from Continuing Operations Net cash used in financing activities was $143.0 million, $431.5 million and $240.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As set forth below for all these years, these changes primarily relate to share repurchases, spin off obligations, payments of dividends, stock based proceeds from stock option exercises, contractual obligations and net borrowings under our credit facility. Share Repurchases During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased 4.5 million shares of common stock for $408.5 million under our share repurchase programs. The share repurchases are comprised of the following programs: In May 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new $200 million, one year share repurchase program, which began in July 2007 upon the completion of the then existing $200 million program. We purchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $173.2 million under the new $200 million program during the year ended December 31, 2007. This program was completed in February 2008; In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million, one year share repurchase program which began in October 2006. We repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $125.0 million under this program during the year ended December 31, 2007. This program was completed in July 2007; and In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a four year, five million share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of the shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. We repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock for $110.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. This program expires in August 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of common stock for $662.7 million. The share repurchases are comprised of the following programs: In January 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $100 million to our then existing $400 million, two year share repurchase program announced in February 2005. We repurchased 4.2 million shares of common stock for $300.0 million under this program during the year ended December 31, 2006. This program was completed in September 2006; In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million, one year share repurchase program which began in October 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 0.9 million shares of common stock for $75.0 million under this share repurchase program; In July 2003, our Board of Directors approved a three year, six million share repurchase program to mitigate dilution under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. This program was completed in August 2006. We repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock for $199.8 million under this program during the year ended December 31, 2006; and In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a four year, five million share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of the shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for $87.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we repurchased 4.7 million shares of common stock for $295.6 million. The share repurchases are comprised of the following programs: In February 2005, our Board of Directors approved a $400 million, two year share purchase program. We repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for $200.0 million under this program during the year ended December 31, 2005; and 55 Table of Contents In July 2003, our Board of Directors approved a three year, six million share repurchase program to mitigate dilution under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. We repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock for $95.6 million under this program during the year ended December 31, 2005. Spin off Obligations As part of our spin off from Moodys/D&B2 in 2000, Moodys and D&B entered into a Tax Allocation Agreement dated as of September 30, 2000 (the TAA). During the year ended December 31, 2007, we did not make a payment to Moodys/the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (D&B2) under the TAA. We made payments of $20.9 million and $9.2 million to Moodys/D&B2 during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, under the TAA which was fully accrued as of December 31, 2005. See Future Liquidity Sources and Uses of Funds for further details. Dividends The total amount of dividends paid during the year ended December 31, 2007 was $58.4 million. We did not pay any dividends on our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Stock based Programs For the year ended December 31, 2007, net proceeds from stock based awards were $31.3 million compared to $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease in the volume of stock option exercises in the 2007 as compared to the prior period. In addition, the implementation of SFAS No. 123R, effective January 1, 2006, requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax impact of recognized compensation expense to be reported as financing activities from continuing operations cash flow, rather than as operating activities from continuing operations cash flow. This requirement reduced net operating activities from continuing operations cash flows and increased financing activities from continuing operations cash flows by $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Included in the $26.4 million and $39.6 million, was $9.7 million and $19.2 million associated with the exercise of 0.6 million and 1.0 million Moodys stock options for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2006, net proceeds from stock based awards were $50.5 million compared to $64.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily attributed to fewer stock options being exercised partially offset by an increase in the weighted average exercise price of stock options exercised. Contractual Obligations Debt In March 2006, we issued senior notes with a face value of $300 million that mature on March 15, 2011, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 5.50%, payable semi annually. The proceeds were used to repay our then existing $300 million senior notes bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.625%, payable semi annually, which matured in March 2006. We did not issue any debt during the year ended December 31, 2007. Credit Facility At December 31, 2006, we had a $300 million bank revolving credit facility available at prevailing short term interest rates, which we terminated on April 19, 2007 and entered into a $500 million, five year credit facility. On April 19, 2007, we borrowed $182.7 million under our $500 million credit facility and utilized such 56 Table of Contents proceeds to pay down the amounts outstanding under our then existing $300 million credit facility immediately prior to termination. The $500 million credit facility will provide us the ability to access the short term borrowings market from time to time to fund working capital needs, acquisitions and share repurchases. At December 31, 2007, we had $425.3 million of borrowings outstanding under the $500 million credit facility. At December 31, 2006, we had $159.5 million of borrowings outstanding under the $300 million credit facility. On January 25, 2008, we exercised a $150 million expansion feature on our $500 million credit facility bringing the total facility to $650 million. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Future Liquidity Sources and Uses of Funds Contractual Cash Obligations The following table quantifies, as of December 31, 2007, our contractual obligations that will require the use of cash in the future. Contractual Obligations Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter AllOther (Amounts in millions) Long Term Debt(1) $ 724.8 $ $ $ $ 299.5 $ 425.3 $ $ Operating Leases(2) $ 139.0 $ 29.1 $ 22.9 $ 19.3 $ 17.3 $ 15.5 $ 34.9 $ Obligations to Outsourcers(3) $ 453.8 $ 114.8 $ 109.4 $ 93.7 $ 89.7 $ 45.9 $ 0.3 $ Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Payments/Contributions(4) $ 921.4 $ 34.5 $ 36.2 $ 38.0 $ 44.8 $ 34.8 $ 733.1 $ Spin off Obligation(5) $ 19.9 $ 19.9 $ $ $ $ $ $ Unrecognized Tax Benefits(6) $ 90.6 $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 90.6 (1) $299.5 million represents our senior notes with a face value of $300 million that mature in March 2011, net of a $0.5 million discount, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 5.50%, payable semi annually. $425.3 million represents our borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facility at short term interest rates. (2) Most of our operations are conducted from leased facilities, which are under operating leases that expire over the next ten years, with the majority expiring within five years. We also lease certain computer and other equipment under operating leases that expire over the next three years and five years, respectively. These computer and other equipment leases are frequently renegotiated or otherwise changed as the lease terms expire and as advancements in computer technology present opportunities to lower costs and improve performance. (3) In July 2002, we outsourced certain technology functions to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) under a 10 year agreement, which we may terminate for a fee at any time and under certain conditions. Under the terms of the agreement, CSC is responsible for the data center operations, technology help desk, network management functions and for certain application development and maintenance in the U.S. and UK. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred $80.4 million under this contract and have a remaining commitment of approximately $343 million. The obligation under the contract is based on our historical and expected future level of usage and volume. If our future volume changes, payments under the contract could vary up or down based on specified formulas. Charges are subject to increases to partially offset inflation. In December 2003, we signed a three year agreement with ICT Group, Inc. (ICT), effective January 2004, to outsource certain marketing call center activities, which contains two renewal options for up to a one year period. The agreement was amended effective September 2007 to be extended through 2011. Under the 57 Table of Contents terms of the agreement, ICT will be responsible for performing certain marketing and credit calling activities previously performed by D&Bs own call centers in North America. The obligation under the contract is based upon transmitted call volumes, but shall not be less than $3 million per contract year. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred $4.5 million under this contract and have a remaining commitment of approximately $12 million. In October 2004, we signed a seven year outsourcing agreement with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Under the terms of the agreement, we have transitioned certain portions of our data acquisition and delivery, customer service and financial processes to IBM. We may terminate this agreement for a fee at any time. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred $30.7 million under this contract and have a remaining commitment of approximately $49 million. In July 2006, we signed four year product and technology outsourcing agreements with Acxiom Corporation in order to significantly increase the speed, data processing capacity and matching capabilities we provide our U.S. sales and marketing customers. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred fulfillment costs of $6.6 million and have a remaining commitment of approximately $16 million. (4) Represents projected contributions to our non U.S. defined benefit plans as well as projected benefit payments related to our unfunded plans, including the U.S. Non Qualified Plans and our postretirement benefit plan. We do not expect to make any contributions to our U.S. Qualified Plan. The expected benefits are estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure our benefit obligation at the end of 2007 and include benefits attributable to estimated future employee service. A closed group approach is used in calculating the projected benefit payments, assuming only the participants who are currently in the valuation population are included in the projection and the projected benefits continue for up to approximately 99 years. (5) As part of our spin off from Moodys/D&B2 in 2000, Moodys/D&B2 and D&B entered into a TAA. Under the TAA, Moodys/D&B2 and D&B agreed that Moodys/D&B2 would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with the exercise of Moodys stock options (including Moodys stock options exercised by D&B employees) and D&B would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with the exercise of D&B stock options (including D&B stock options exercised by employees of Moodys/D&B2). Put simply, the tax deduction would go to the company that granted the stock options, rather than to the employer of the individual who exercised the stock options. The TAA provides, however, that if the IRS issues rules, regulations or other authority contrary to the agreed upon treatment of the compensation expense deductions under the TAA, then the party that becomes entitled under such guidance to take the deduction may be required to reimburse the tax benefit it has realized, in order to compensate the other party for its loss of such deduction. In 2002 and 2003, the IRS issued rulings that appear to provide that under the circumstances applicable to us the compensation expense deduction belongs to the employer of the option grantee and not to the issuer of the option (i.e., D&B would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with D&B employees exercising Moodys/D&B2 options). We have filed tax returns for 2001 through 2006, and made estimated tax deposits for 2007, consistent with the IRS rulings. We received (or believe we are due) the benefit of additional tax deductions, and under the TAA we may be required to reimburse Moodys/D&B2 for the loss of income tax deductions relating to tax years 2003 to 2007 of approximately $19.9 million in the aggregate for such years. This potential reimbursement would be accounted for as a reduction to shareholders equity. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we made a payment of $20.9 million to Moodys/D&B2 under the TAA that was fully accrued for as of December 31, 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we did not make a payment to Moodys/D&B2. We may also be required to pay additional amounts in the future based upon interpretations by the parties of the TAA and the IRS rulings, timing of future exercises of stock options, the future price of stock underlying the stock options and relevant tax rates. As of December 31, 2007, current and former employees of D&B held 0.6 million Moodys stock options. These stock options had a weighted average exercise price of $11.66 and a remaining, weighted average contractual life of one and a half years. All of these stock options are currently exercisable. 58 Table of Contents (6) We adopted FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, or FIN 48, as of January 1, 2007. We have a total amount of unrecognized tax benefits of $131.8 million for the year ending December 31, 2007. Although we do not anticipate payments within the next twelve months for these matters, these could require the aggregate use of cash totaling approximately $90.6 million. As we can not make reliable estimates regarding the timing of the cash flows by period, we have included FIN 48 liabilities within the All Other column in the table above. Capital Structure Every year we examine our capital structure and review our plans. During 2008, in connection with our focus on TSR, we anticipate continued share repurchases and have initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share payable on March 17, 2008, to shareholders of record on the close of business on February 29, 2008, as approved by our Board of Directors in December 2007. We believe that cash provided by operating activities, supplemented as needed with readily available financing arrangements, is sufficient to meet our short term needs, including the cash cost of restructuring charges, transition costs, contractual obligations and contingencies, excluding the legal matters identified herein for which exposures cannot be estimated. As we execute our long term TSR strategy, which contemplates strategic acquisitions, we may require or consider additional financing to fund our TSR strategy. We regularly evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile and various financing alternatives for opportunities to enhance our capital structure. While we feel confident that such financing arrangements are available to us, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to access new sources of liquidity when required. On January 25, 2008, we exercised a $150 million expansion feature on our $500 million credit facility expanding the total facility to $650 million. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In January 2008, we entered into a series of rate locks with a notional value of $400 million to hedge treasury rate volatility in anticipation of a future debt issuance. Share Repurchases and Dividends In order to mitigate the dilutive effect of the shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP, our Board of Directors approved in August 2006, a new four year, five million share repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock for $110.3 million under this program with 2.7 million shares remaining to be repurchased. In May 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new $200 million, one year share repurchase program, which commenced in July 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $173.2 million under this new program with $26.8 million remaining available for purchases as of such date. In December 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new $400 million, two year share repurchase program. The new $400 million program began in February 2008, upon the completion of the existing $200 million program which had $26.8 million remaining as of December 31, 2007. We anticipate that the new $400 million program will be completed within twenty four months of its commencement. In December 2007, our Board of Directors approved the declaration of a $0.30 per share for the first quarter of 2008. This cash dividend is payable on March 17, 2008, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 29, 2008. 59 Table of Contents Potential Payments in Tax and Legal Matters We and our predecessors are involved in certain tax and legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. These matters are at various stages of resolution, but could ultimately result in significant cash payments as described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We believe we have adequate reserves recorded in our consolidated financial statements for our share of current exposures in these matters. Financial Flexibility Program An integral component of our strategy is creating financial flexibility to fund investments for growth and to create shareholder value. Through our Financial Flexibility Program we continually and systematically seek ways to improve our performance in terms of quality and cost. Specifically, we seek to eliminate, standardize, consolidate and automate our business functions. As a part of each program, we have incurred a restructuring charge, which generally consists of, among other things, employee severance and termination costs. We also have incurred transition costs, which generally consist of other costs necessary to accomplish the process changes such as consulting fees, cost of temporary workers, relocation costs and stay bonuses. Our 2008 Financial Flexibility Program, which was approved on January 24, 2008, builds on efforts initiated in 2007 to reduce significantly the complexity of our business, a process that we anticipate continuing over the next several years. Specifically, in 2008, we will continue to address complexity reduction and create financial flexibility through several initiatives including the following: Enhancing Organizational Effectiveness: this initiative is intended to reduce organizational complexity and improve the efficiency of how we are organized and how we operate as a business by continuing to address spans of control, consolidating like functions and eliminating non essential activities; Simplifying our Products and Technology: this initiative is intended to simplify the various platforms and products we offer our customers and moving to fewer and easier to use web based platforms like DNBi and Hoovers and eliminating and consolidating systems and technology infrastructure; Streamlining Data Collection and Product Ordering: this initiative is intended to standardize and automate processes to drive efficiencies and quality to support our overall DUNSRight data strategy; and Improving Overall Business Effectiveness: this initiative is intended to improve the efficiencies of our operations by centralizing management of key cost drivers, vendor consolidation and contract renegotiation. In addition, we are focusing on driving revenue growth by reducing the non selling time of our sales force, enhancing our new customer acquisition activities and go to market approaches. On an annualized basis, the actions under our 2008 Financial Flexibility Program are expected to create $75 million to $80 million of financial flexibility, of which approximately $60 million to $65 million will be generated in 2008, before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of savings generated by the initiatives. We expect all actions under our 2008 program to be completed by December 2008. To implement these initiatives we expect to incur transition costs of approximately $13 million to $15 million in 2008. In addition, we expect to incur restructuring charges totaling $20 million to $25 million pre tax, of which $18 million to $23 million relate to severance, approximately $1 million relate to lease termination obligations and approximately $1 million relate to other exit costs in 2008. Approximately $30 million to $40 million of these transition costs and restructuring charges are expected to result in cash expenditures. As a result of this financial flexibility program we expect that approximately 300 350 positions will be eliminated globally. 60 Table of Contents Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefit Plan Contribution Requirements For financial statement reporting purposes, the funded status of our pension plans, as determined in accordance with GAAP, had a surplus of $274.7 million for the U.S. Qualified Plan, a deficit of $217.1 million for the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, and a deficit of $60.0 million for the non U.S. plans at December 31, 2007, as compared to a surplus of $199.0 million, a deficit of $235.0 million, and a deficit of $106.0 million, respectively for such plans, at December 31, 2006. The improvement in the funded status of the U.S. plans was primarily due to a higher discount rate at December 31, 2007 and the curtailment impact associated with the plan freeze in 2007. The improvement was negatively impacted by a change in mortality table assumption for our U.S. plans. The improvement in funded status of the non U.S. plans was primarily due to a lower projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2007, primarily driven by a higher discount rate. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. For funding purposes, as governed by the Internal Revenue Service regulations, we are not required to contribute to the U.S. Qualified Plan, the largest of our six plans, in 2008 as the plan was considered fully funded under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for the 2007 plan year. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA 2006) was signed into law. One of the principal changes under this legislation relates to the way assets and liabilities are valued to determine required pension contributions. The majority of the changes are effective in 2008. At the current date, there are still factors that need to be clarified or defined in the guidance by the regulatory bodies to fully analyze the impact of PPA 2006 on our plans. Based on the current understanding of the legislative changes, if the U.S. Qualified Plan asset returns are flat and the assets decline by the amount of benefits paid to plan participants, and all other factors affecting when contributions are required remain the same, we would not be required to make contributions to this plan until 2012. If plan assets appreciate between now and 2012, the need to make a required contribution would be delayed beyond 2012. If plan assets depreciate between now and 2012, we could be required to make contributions sooner than 2012. We expect to continue to make cash contributions to our other pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2008. The expected 2008 contribution is approximately $23.5 million, compared to $30.9 million in 2007. In addition, we expect to make benefit payments related to our postretirement benefit plan of approximately $11.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $13.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. See the Contractual Cash Obligations table above for projected contributions and benefit payments beyond 2008. In addition, we expect 2008 cash contributions to the 401(k) Plan to be approximately $21.0 million compared to $12.0 million in 2007. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Related Party Transactions We do not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off balance sheet arrangements except for those disclosed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Additionally, we have not engaged in any significant related party transactions. Forward Looking Statements We may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in reports to shareholders and in press releases and investor Web casts. These forward looking statements can be identified by the use of words like anticipates, aspirations, believes, continues, estimates, expects, goals, 61 Table of Contents guidance, intends, plans, projects, strategy, targets, commits, will and other words of similar meaning. They can also be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and whether to invest in, or remain invested in, our securities. In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying in the following paragraphs important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements: We rely significantly on third parties to support critical components of our business model in a continuous and high quality manner, including third party data providers, strategic third party members in our D&B Worldwide Network, and third parties with whom we have outsourcing arrangements; Demand for our products is subject to intense competition, changes in customer preferences and, to a lesser extent, economic conditions which impact customer behavior; Our solutions and brand image are dependent upon the integrity and security of our global database and the continued availability thereof through the internet and by other means, as well as our ability to protect key assets, such as our data centers; Our ability to maintain the integrity of our brand and reputation, which we believe are key assets and competitive advantages; Our ability to renew large contracts, the related revenue recognition and the timing thereof may impact our results of operations from period to period; Our results are subject to the effects of foreign economies, exchange rate fluctuations, legislative or regulatory requirements, such as the adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices, including pronouncements by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies, and the implementation or modification of fees or taxes that we must pay to acquire, use, and or redistribute data; Our ability to introduce new Web based solutions or services in a seamless way and without disruption to existing solutions such as DNBi; Our ability to acquire and successfully integrate other complementary businesses, products and technologies into our existing business, without significant disruption to our existing business or to our financial results; The continued adherence by third party members of our D&B Worldwide Network to our data quality standards, our brand and communication standards and to the terms and conditions of our commercial services arrangements; Our future success requires that we attract and retain qualified personnel, including members of our sales force, in regions throughout the world; The profitability of our International segment depends on our ability to identify and execute on various initiatives, such as the implementation of subscription plan pricing and successfully managing our D&B Worldwide Network, and our ability to identify and contend with various challenges present in foreign markets, such as local competition and the availability of public records at no cost; 62 Table of Contents Our ability to successfully implement our Blueprint for Growth Strategy requires that we successfully reduce our expense base through our Financial Flexibility initiatives, and reallocate certain of the expense base reductions into initiatives that produce desired revenue growth; We are involved in various tax matters and legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are unknown and uncertain with respect to the impact on our cash flow and profitability; Our ability to repurchase shares is subject to market conditions, including trading volume in our stock, and our ability to repurchase shares in accordance with applicable securities laws; and Our projection for free cash flow is dependent upon our ability to generate revenue, our collection processes, customer payment patterns, the timing and volume of stock option exercises and the amount and timing of payments related to the tax and other matters and legal proceedings in which we are involved. We elaborate on the above list of important factors throughout this document and in our other filings with the SEC, particularly in the discussion of our Risk Factors in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. It should be understood that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, the above list of important factors and the Risk Factors discussed in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K should not be considered to be a complete discussion of all of our potential trends, risks and uncertainties. Except as otherwise required by federal securities laws, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement we may make from time to time. Item 7A.
