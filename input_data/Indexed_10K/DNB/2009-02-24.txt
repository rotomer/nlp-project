Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations How We Manage Our Business For internal management purposes, we refer to core revenue, which we calculate as total operating revenue less the revenue of divested businesses. Core revenue is used to manage and evaluate the performance of our segments and to allocate resources because this measure provides an indication of the underlying changes in revenue in a single performance measure. Core revenue does not include reported revenue of divested businesses since they are not included in future revenue. On December 27, 2007, we sold our Italian real estate business for $9.0 million, which was a part of our International segment, and we have reclassified the historical financial results of the Italian real estate business as discontinued operations for all periods presented as set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Accordingly, we have recorded the resulting gain from the sale of $0.4 million (both pre tax and after tax) in the first quarter of 2008 in the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2008, we received approximately $9.0 million in cash. We also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because we believe it is useful for investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another, both with and without the effects of foreign exchange. As a result, we monitor our core revenue growth both after and before the effects of foreign exchange. Core revenue growth excluding the effects of foreign exchange is referred to as revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange. From time to time we have and we may continue to further analyze core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange among two components, organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions. We analyze organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions because management believes this information provides insight into the underlying health of our business. Core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition. We evaluate the performance of our business segments based on segment revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange, and segment operating income growth before certain types of gains and charges that we consider do not reflect our underlying business performance. Specifically, for management reporting purposes, we evaluate business segment performance before non core gains and charges because such charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations. A recurring component of non core gains and charges are our restructuring charges, which result from a foundational element of our growth strategy that we refer to as Financial Flexibility. Through Financial Flexibility, management identifies opportunities to improve the performance of the business in terms of quality, efficiency and cost, in order to generate savings primarily to invest for growth. Such charges are variable from period to period based upon actions identified and taken during each period. Management reviews operating results before such charges on a monthly basis and establishes internal budgets and forecasts based upon such measures. Management further establishes annual and long term compensation such as salaries, target cash bonuses and target equity compensation amounts based on such measures and a significant percentage weight is placed upon such measures in determining whether performance objectives have been achieved. Management believes that by eliminating restructuring charges from such financial measures, and by being overt to shareholders about the results of our operations excluding such charges, business leaders are provided incentives to recommend and execute actions that are in the best long term interests of our shareholders, rather than being influenced by the potential impact a charge in a particular period could have on their compensation. Additionally, transition costs (period costs such as consulting fees, costs of temporary employees, relocation costs and stay bonuses incurred to implement the Financial Flexibility component of our strategy) are reported as Corporate and Other expenses and are not allocated to our segments. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for financial information regarding our segments. Similarly, when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole, we focus on results (such as operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, net income, tax rate and diluted earnings per share) 25 Table of Contents before non core gains and charges because such non core gains and charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations and may drive behavior that does not ultimately maximize shareholder value. Additionally, for 2008 our non GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America) measures reflect results on a continuing operations basis. We also use free cash flow to manage our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles. Free cash flow measures our available cash flow for potential debt repayment, acquisitions, stock repurchases and additions to cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. We believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating the funding available after supporting our ongoing business operations and our portfolio of product investments. Free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute measure for, or superior to, net cash flows provided by operating activities, investing activities or financing activities. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, we evaluate our U.S. Risk Management Solutions based on two metrics: (1) subscription, non subscription, and (2) DNBi and non DNBi. We define subscription as contracts that allow customers unlimited use within predefined ranges, subject to certain conditions. In these instances, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract, which is generally one year and non subscription as all other revenue streams. We define DNBi as our interactive, customizable online application that offers our customers real time access to our most complete and up to date global DUNSRight information, comprehensive monitoring and portfolio analysis and non DNBi as all other revenue streams. Management believes these measures provide further insight into our performance and growth of our U.S. Risk Management Solutions revenue. The adjustments discussed herein to our results as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods, to allocate resources, to evaluate business performance and, as noted above, for compensation purposes. However, these financial measures (results before non core gains and charges and free cash flow) are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue, operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, net income, tax rate, diluted earnings per share, or net cash provided by operating activities, investing activities and financing activities prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, it should be noted that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly or at all, the presentation of these financial measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies. See Results of Operations below for a discussion of our results reported on a GAAP basis. Overview We have historically managed and reported our operations under the following two segments: United States (U.S.); and International (which consists of operations in Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific and Latin America). The financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. and Canada reflect a fiscal year ended November 30 to facilitate the timely reporting of our consolidated financial results and financial position. We continue to manage our business through two segments. However, as of January 1, 2009, Canada has been moved out of our International segment and into our renamed North America segment (formerly our U.S. segment). Therefore, on January 1, 2009, we began managing our operations through two segments: North America 26 Table of Contents (which consists of the U.S. and Canada) and International (which consists of our operations in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America). We will report financial results in this new segment structure beginning with the results for the first quarter of 2009 and conform historical amounts to reflect the new segment structure. Total revenue and core revenue were the same for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Therefore, our discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, references only our core revenue results. The following table presents the contribution by segment of core revenue results. For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenue: U.S. 77 % 78 % 79 % International 23 % 22 % 21 % On January 1, 2008, we began managing our Supply Management business as part of our Risk Management Solutions business. This is consistent with our overall strategy and also reflects customers needs to better understand the financial risk of their supply chain. As a result, the contributions of the Supply Management business are now reported as a part of Risk Management Solutions. We have reclassified our historical financial results set forth in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Prior to January 1, 2008, we reported the results of our Supply Management business as its own solution set. The following table presents the contribution by customer solution set to core revenue. For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenue by Customer Solution Set: Risk Management Solutions 64 % 64 % 66 % Sales & Marketing Solutions 29 % 29 % 28 % Internet Solutions 7 % 7 % 6 % These customer solution sets are discussed in greater detail in Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Within our Risk Management Solutions, we monitor the performance of our Traditional products, our Value Added products and our Supply Management products. Within our Sales & Marketing Solutions, we monitor the performance of our Traditional products and our Value Added products. Risk Management Solutions Our Traditional Risk Management Solutions generally consist of reports from our database used primarily for making decisions about new credit applications.

Of those policies, we consider the policies described below to be critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require managements subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If actual results in a given period ultimately differ from previous estimates, the actual results could have a material impact on such period. 28 Table of Contents We have discussed the selection and application of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure regarding critical accounting policies and estimates as well as the other sections in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations Through June 30, 2007, we previously offered to substantially all of our U.S. based employees coverage under a defined benefit plan called The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation Retirement Account (the U.S. Qualified Plan). The defined benefit plan covers active and retired employees including retired individuals from spin off companies (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further discussion of spin off companies). The benefits to be paid upon retirement are based on a percentage of the employees annual compensation. The percentage of compensation allocated annually to a retirement account ranges from 3% to 12.5% based on age and service. Amounts allocated under the plan also receive interest credits based on the 30 year Treasury rate or equivalent rate published by the Internal Revenue Service. Pension costs are determined actuarially and funded in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. We also maintain supplemental and excess plans in the United States (the U.S. Non Qualified Plans) to provide additional retirement benefits to certain key employees of the Company. These plans are unfunded, pay as you go plans. The U.S. Qualified Plan and the U.S. Non Qualified Plans account for approximately 73% and 16% of our pension obligation, respectively, at December 31, 2008. Effective June 30, 2007, we amended the U.S. Qualified Plan and one of the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, known as the U.S. Pension Benefit Equalization Plan (the PBEP). Any pension benefit that had been accrued through such date under the two plans was frozen at its then current value and no additional benefits, other than interest on such amounts, will accrue under the U.S. Qualified Plan and the PBEP. Our employees in certain of our international operations are also provided retirement benefits through defined benefit plans, representing the remaining balance of our pension obligations. We also provide various health care and life insurance benefits for retirees. U.S. based employees, who retire with 10 years of vesting service after age 45, are eligible to receive benefits. Postretirement benefit costs and obligations are determined actuarially. In accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, or SFAS No. 87, amended by SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, or SFAS No. 158, our pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial assumptions and methodologies. Other postretirement benefits (i.e., health care) are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, or SFAS No. 106, amended by SFAS No. 158, and are also dependent on the application of our assumptions by outside actuaries. The key assumptions used in the measurement of the pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement costs are: Expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets which is based on a target asset allocation as well as expected returns on asset categories of plan investments; Discount rate which is used to measure the present value of pension plan obligations and postretirement health care obligations. The discount rates are derived using a yield curve approach which matches projected plan benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans; Rates of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation/conversion rates which are based on an evaluation of internal plans and external market indicators; and Health care cost trends which are based on historical cost data, the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends. 29 Table of Contents We believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, though changes in these assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The factor with the most immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements is a change in the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets for the U.S. Qualified Plan. For 2009, we will continue to use an expected long term rate of return of 8.25%. This assumption was 8.25% in each of the years for 2008, 2007 and 2006. The 8.25% assumption represents our best estimate of the expected long term future investment performance of the U.S. Qualified Plan, after considering expectations for future capital market returns and the plans asset allocation. As of December 31, 2008, the plan was 63% invested in publicly traded equity securities, 29% invested in debt securities and 8% invested in real estate investments. Due to recent significant declines in equity markets, our actual asset allocation of plan assets at December 31, 2008 differed slightly from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation. Every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the long term rate of return increases or reduces our annual operating income by approximately $3 million by increasing or reducing our net periodic pension income. Changes in the discount rate, rate of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation/conversion rates also have an effect on our annual operating income. Based on the factors noted above, the discount rate is adjusted at each remeasurement date while other assumptions are reviewed annually. The discount rate used to determine pension cost for our U.S. pension plans was 6.37%, 5.84% and 5.50% for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For 2009, for all of our U.S. pension plans, we decreased the discount rate to 6.15% from 6.37%. Differences between the assumptions stated above and actual experience could affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise which are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106, as amended by SFAS No. 158. These gains and losses are aggregated and amortized generally over the average future service periods of employees to the extent that such gains or losses exceed a corridor as defined in SFAS No. 87. The purpose of the corridor is to reduce the volatility caused by the difference between actual experience and the pension related assumptions noted above, on a plan by plan basis. For all of our pension plans, total actuarial losses that have not been recognized in our pension costs as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $855.2 million and $378.8 million, respectively, of which $682.1 million and $220.1 million, respectively, were attributable to the U.S. Qualified Plan, $89.5 million and $77.4 million, respectively, were attributable to the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, and the remainder was attributable to the non U.S. pension plans. See discussion in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We expect to recognize a portion of such losses in our 2009 net periodic pension cost of approximately $18.2 million, $4.8 million and $1.0 million, for the U.S. Qualified Plan, U.S. Non Qualified Plans and non U.S. plans, respectively, compared to $9.5 million, $4.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively, in 2008. The higher amortization of actuarial loss in 2009 of $8.7 million and $0.2 million related to the U.S. Qualified Plan and the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, respectively, which will be included in our pension cost in 2009, is primarily due to significant asset loss during 2008 and lower discount rates applied to the pension plans at December 31, 2008. Differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could affect our net periodic pension cost. We recorded net pension periodic income for our pension plans of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and net pension cost of $10.7 million and $27.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A major component of the net periodic pension cost is the expected return on plan assets, which was $121.7 million, $117.1 million and $113.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The expected return on plan assets was determined by multiplying the expected long term rate of return assumption by the market related value of plan assets. The market related value of plan assets recognizes asset gains and losses over five years to reduce the effects of short term market fluctuations on net periodic cost. We recorded investment losses of $392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and investment gains of $105.7 million and $175.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, in our pension plans, of which a loss of $348.1 million and gains of $91.2 million and $157.1 million, respectively, were attributable to the U.S. Qualified Plan and a loss of $44.1 million and 30 Table of Contents gains of $14.6 million and $18.4 million, respectively, were attributable to the non U.S. plans. At January 1, 2009, the market related value of plan assets of our U.S. Qualified Plan and the non U.S. plans was $1,309.6 million and $149.1 million, respectively, compared with the fair value of its plan assets of $953.3 million and $121.3 million, respectively. Changes in the funded status of our pension plans could result in fluctuation in our shareholders equity. We adopted SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006 and we are required to recognize the funded status of our benefit plans as a liability or an asset, on a plan by plan basis, with an offsetting adjustment to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, or AOCI, in shareholders equity, net of tax. Accordingly, the amounts recognized in equity represent unrecognized gains/losses and prior service costs. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs included in shareholders equity would be amortized out of equity based on an actuarial calculation each period. Gains and losses and prior service costs that arise during the year will be recognized as a component of comprehensive income which is a component of AOCI. We recorded a net loss of $291.1 million and net income of $79.3 million in AOCI, net of applicable tax, in 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to the actuarial gain/loss and prior service cost arising during the period and the amortization of such items. The increased loss in 2008 was primarily due to the reduction of the funded status for our U.S. Qualified Plan from a surplus of $274.7 million at December 31, 2007 to a deficit of $155.5 million at December 31, 2008, driven by significant asset loss in 2008 and lower discount rate at December 31, 2008. For information on pension and postretirement benefit plan contribution requirements, please see Future Liquidity Sources and Uses of Funds Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefit Plan Contribution Requirements. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for more information regarding costs of, and assumptions for, our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs. Contingencies and Litigation We establish reserves in connection with tax and legal proceedings, claims and litigation when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time. Estimating probable losses requires analyses of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments concerning potential actions by third parties and regulators. This is an inherently subjective and complex process, and actual results may differ from our estimates by material amounts. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when the following four conditions are met: Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; The contract fee is fixed and determinable; Delivery or performance has occurred; and Collectibility is reasonably assured. If at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment. If there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. If at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. 31 Table of Contents Our Risk Management Solutions are generally sold under fixed price subscription contracts that allow those customers unlimited use within predefined ranges, subject to certain conditions. In these instances, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract, which is generally one year. For arrangements that include an information file delivery with periodic updates to that information file over the contract term, the portion of the revenue related to updates expected to be delivered is deferred as a liability on the balance sheet and recognized as the updates are delivered, usually on a quarterly or monthly basis. We also have monthly or annual contracts that enable a customer to purchase our information solutions during the period of contract at prices per an agreed price list, up to the contracted dollar limit. Revenue on these contracts is recognized as solutions are delivered to the customer, based on the per solution price. Any additional solutions purchased over this limit may be subject to pricing variations, and revenue is recognized as the solutions are delivered. If customers do not use the full value of their contract and forfeit the unused portion, we recognize the forfeited amount as revenue at contract expiration. Revenue related to services provided over the contract term, such as monitoring services, is recognized ratably over the contract period, which is typically one year. For Sales & Marketing Solutions, we generally recognize revenue upon delivery of the information file to the customer. For arrangements that include periodic updates to that information file over the contract term, the portion of the revenue related to updates expected to be delivered is deferred as a liability on the balance sheet and recognized as the updates are delivered, usually on a quarterly or monthly basis. For subscription solutions that provide continuous access to our marketing information and business reference databases, as well as any access fees or hosting fees related to enabling customers access to our information, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically one year. Our Internet Solutions consists of Hoovers, Inc., which also includes Hoovers First Research division and AllBusiness.com, Inc. Hoovers and First Research provide subscription solutions that allow continuous access to our business information databases. Revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is generally one year. Any additional solutions purchased are recognized upon delivery to the customer. AllBusiness.com provides online media and e commerce products that provide advertisers the ability to target small business customers. Revenue is recognized as solutions are delivered to the customer over the contract period. For offerings that include software that is considered to be more than incidental, we recognize revenue when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed and the software has been shipped and installed. Revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the services are performed. Amounts billed in advance are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet as deferred revenue and are recognized as the services are performed. We have certain solution offerings that are sold as multi element arrangements. The multiple elements may include information files, file updates for certain solutions, software, services, trademarks and or other intangibles. For those arrangements that include multi elements, we first determine whether each deliverable meets the separation criteria to qualify as a separate unit of accounting under Financial Statement Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, or EITF 00 21. If the deliverable or a group of deliverables meets the separation criteria under EITF 00 21, we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each unit of accounting based upon the relative fair value of each unit of accounting. The amount of arrangement consideration that is allocated to a delivered unit of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another unit of accounting. 32 Table of Contents After the arrangement consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting, we apply the appropriate revenue recognition method for each unit of accounting that meets the four conditions described above. All deliverables that do not meet the separation of accounting criteria under EITF 00 21 are combined into one unit of accounting, and the most appropriate revenue recognition method is applied. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for disclosure of the impact that recently issued accounting standards may have on our audited consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements. They should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes set forth in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Consolidated Revenue The following table presents our revenue by segment: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Amounts in millions) Revenue: U.S. $ 1,321.1 $ 1,248.3 $ 1,164.2 International 405.2 350.9 310.7 Core Revenue $ 1,726.3 $ 1,599.2 $ 1,474.9 The following table presents our revenue by customer solution set: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Amounts in millions) Revenue: Risk Management Solutions $ 1,111.0 $ 1,032.2 $ 974.0 Sales & Marketing Solutions 490.4 459.5 412.2 Internet Solutions 124.9 107.5 88.7 Core Revenue $ 1,726.3 $ 1,599.2 $ 1,474.9 Year ended December 31, 2008 vs. Year ended December 31, 2007 Core revenue increased $127.1 million, or 8% (7% increase before the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was driven by an increase in total U.S. revenue of $72.8 million, or 6%, and an increase in total International revenue of $54.3 million, or 16% (12% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). This $127.1 million increase is primarily attributed to: Growth in each of our subscription plans for our Preferred Pricing Agreement and for our Preferred Pricing Agreement with DNBi from existing customers willing to increase the level of business they do 33 Table of Contents with us, including the customers who previously purchased value added solutions. These subscription plans provide our customers with unlimited use of our Risk Management reports and data, within pre defined ranges, and generally customers commit to an increased level of spend from their historical levels; Increased revenue as a result of our recent acquisitions and our Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture in 2007 (our majority owned joint venture in Japan); and The positive impact of foreign exchange; partially offset by: Lower purchases of our legacy products. Customer Solution Set On a customer solution set basis, the $127.1 million increase in core revenue reflects: A $78.8 million, or 8%, increase in Risk Management Solutions (7% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $34.0 million, or 5%, and growth in International of $44.8 million, or 16% (13% increase before the effect of foreign exchange); A $30.9 million, or 7%, increase in Sales & Marketing Solutions (6% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $21.2 million, or 5%, and an increase in International of $9.7 million, or 14% (12% increase before the effect of foreign exchange); and A $17.4 million, or 16%, increase in Internet Solutions (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $17.6 million, or 18% partially offset by a decrease in International of $0.2 million, or 3% (1% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange). Year ended December 31, 2007 vs. Year ended December 31, 2006 Core revenue increased $124.3 million, or 8% (7% increase before the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was driven by an increase in total U.S. revenue of $84.1 million, or 7%, and an increase in total International revenue of $40.2 million, or 13% (5% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). This $124.3 million increase is primarily attributed to: Higher purchases from our existing customers; The positive impact of foreign exchange; Growth in each of our subscription plans for our Preferred Pricing Agreement and for our Preferred Pricing Agreement with DNBi from existing customers willing to increase the level of business they do with us; Increased revenue as a result of our acquisitions and our Huaxia/D&B China Joint Venture during the fourth quarter of 2007 (our majority owned joint venture in China) and the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of n2 Check Limited (n2 Check) in the UK during the second quarter of 2007; Continued growth in subscription revenue at Hoovers; and Higher levels of project oriented business in our Sales & Marketing Solutions; partially offset by: Decreased usage in the UK market, primarily as a result of lower product usage from a key global customer. 34 Table of Contents Customer Solution Set On a customer solution set basis, the $124.3 million increase in core revenue reflects: A $58.2 million, or 6%, increase in Risk Management Solutions (4% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $33.2 million, or 5%, and growth in International of $25.0 million, or 10% (2% increase before the effect of foreign exchange); A $47.3 million, or 12%, increase in Sales & Marketing Solutions (10% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $33.7 million, or 10%, and an increase in International of $13.6 million, or 24% (16% increase before the effect of foreign exchange); and An $18.8 million, or 21%, increase in Internet Solutions (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by growth in the U.S. of $17.2 million, or 21%, and growth in International of $1.6 million, or 29% (20% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). Consolidated Operating Costs The following table presents our consolidated operating costs and operating income: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Amounts in millions) Operating Expenses $ 480.7 $ 430.4 $ 410.9 Selling and Administrative Expenses 686.0 671.5 612.7 Depreciation and Amortization 58.5 46.6 32.1 Restructuring Charge 31.4 25.1 25.5 Operating Costs $ 1,256.6 $ 1,173.6 $ 1,081.2 Operating Income $ 469.7 $ 425.6 $ 393.7 As described above in the section Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations How We Manage Our Business, when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole, we focus on our operating income (and, therefore, operating costs) before non core gains and charges, because we do not view these items as reflecting our underlying business operations. We have identified under the caption Non Core Gains and (Charges) below, such non core gains and charges that are included in our GAAP results. Operating Expenses Year ended December 31, 2008 vs. Year ended December 31, 2007 Operating expenses increased by $50.3 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to the following: Costs associated with investments in connection with our strategy, such as DNBi, our interactive, web based subscription service, and investments to improve customer satisfaction levels; Increased costs associated with our recent acquisitions and our Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture (our majority owned joint venture in Japan); The impact of foreign exchange; and Increased technology costs arising from obligations under our D&B Worldwide Network agreements; partially offset by: Lower costs as a result of our reengineering efforts. 35 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2007 vs. Year ended December 31, 2006 Operating expenses increased by $19.5 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to the following: Costs associated with investments in DNBi, our interactive, web based subscription service, our investments in our DUNSRight Quality Process and our investments to enhance our strategic capabilities, such as with Acxiom Corporation (Acxiom), in order to significantly increase the speed, data processing capacity and matching capabilities we provide our U.S. sales and marketing customers; The impact of foreign exchange; and Increased technology costs arising from obligations under our D&B Worldwide Network agreements; partially offset by: Lower costs as a result of our reengineering efforts. Selling and Administrative Expenses Year ended December 31, 2008 vs. Year ended December 31, 2007 Selling and administrative expenses increased $14.5 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to the following: Increased selling expenses primarily related to investments to enhance our strategic capabilities, such as with our recent acquisitions and our Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture (our majority owned Joint Venture in Japan); and The impact of foreign exchange; partially offset by: Lower costs as a result of our reengineering efforts. Year ended December 31, 2007 vs. Year ended December 31, 2006 Selling and administrative expenses increased $58.8 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to the following: Increased selling expenses primarily related to costs associated with investments to enhance our strategic capabilities, such as with our Huaxia/D&B China Joint Venture and our recent acquisitions; and The impact of foreign exchange; partially offset by: Lower costs as a result of our reengineering efforts. Matters Impacting Both Operating Expenses and Selling and Administrative Expenses Pension, Postretirement and 401(k) Plan We had pension income of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and pension costs of $10.7 million and $27.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, for our pension plans globally. The fluctuation in the pension cost was due to the following: The discount rates applied to the pension plans were major factors in driving the pension costs to fluctuate from year to year. The higher the discount rate, the lower the pension cost. The discount rate used to measure the pension income/costs for our U.S. plans for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 6.37%, 5.84% and 5.50%, respectively. 36 Table of Contents Actuarial loss amortization included in annual pension expense as required by SFAS No. 87 and the impact of the discount rates were also major factors in driving the pension costs to fluctuate from year to year. The higher the discount rate, the lower the pension cost. Actuarial loss amortization included in annual pension expense for all global plans was $16.2 million, $23.5 million and $31.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, of which $14.1 million, $19.7 million and $29.2 million were attributable to our U.S. plans for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Higher pension income in 2008 was primarily due to a 53 basis points and 100 basis points increase in the discount rate applied to our U.S. plans and the major International plans, respectively, in 2008, as well as lower actuarial loss amortization included in 2008. Lower pension costs in 2007 compared with 2006 was also largely due to the elimination of service costs as a result of the pension plan freeze in the U.S. effective June 30, 2007. We expect that the net pension cost in 2009 will be approximately $6.4 million for all of our global pension plans. The increase in pension cost from 2008 to 2009 is primarily driven by higher actuarial loss amortization included in 2009 and a 22 basis points decrease in the discount rate applied to our U.S. plans at January 1, 2008. We had postretirement benefit income of $4.2 million, $3.5 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Higher postretirement benefit income in 2008 compared with 2007 and 2006 was primarily due to higher amortization actuarial gain driven by positive plan experience and changes in assumptions. We expect postretirement benefit income will be approximately $0.6 million in 2009. The decrease in income from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to the amortization of the prior service credit which is now fully amortized. This prior service was related to the 2003 plan amendment to limit our insurance premium contribution. We had expense associated with our 401(k) Plan of $19.2 million, $12.0 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in expense in 2008 and 2007 was due to the amendment of our matching policy in the 401(k) Plan effective July 1, 2007, to increase our match formula from 50% to 100% of a team members contributions and to increase the maximum match to seven percent (7%) from six percent (6%), of such team members eligible compensation, subject to certain 401(k) Plan limitations. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for changes to our 401(k) Plan. We consider net pension income/cost and postretirement benefit income to be part of our compensation costs, and, therefore, they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses, based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs. See the discussion of Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations, above, and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payments, or SFAS No. 123R, which requires us to recognize stock based compensation for our stock option programs and Employee Stock Purchase Plan or ESPP. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized total stock based compensation expense of $27.6 million, $25.9 million and $20.8 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized expense associated with our stock option programs of $11.0 million, $11.9 million and $12.7 million, respectively. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to fewer stock options outstanding when compared to the same period in 37 Table of Contents 2007. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily due to fewer unvested stock options outstanding expensed in 2007 partially offset by fewer forfeitures associated with fewer terminated employees in 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized expense associated with restricted stock, restricted stock unit and restricted stock opportunity awards of $15.6 million, $13.1 million and $7.1 million (net of $0.5 million related to the accumulated effect of forfeiture assumptions), respectively. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to the addition of the 2008 annual grant and special grants in the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily due to the addition of the 2007 annual grant, fewer forfeitures associated with fewer terminated employees in 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006 and a cumulative accounting adjustment included in the three months ended March 31, 2006 expense to reflect adjustments to previously recognized compensation expense for awards outstanding at the adoption date of SFAS No. 123R that we do not expect to vest. We consider these costs to be part of our compensation costs and, therefore, they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses, based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs. Depreciation and Amortization Year ended December 31, 2008 vs. Year ended December 31, 2007 Depreciation and amortization increased $11.9 million, or 26%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily driven by the increased capital costs for revenue generating investments to enhance our strategic capabilities (such as DNBi) and the amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions and our majority owned joint ventures. Year ended December 31, 2007 vs. Year ended December 31, 2006 Depreciation and amortization increased $14.5 million, or 45%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily driven by the increased capital costs in investments to enhance our strategic capabilities and amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions and our majority owned joint ventures. Restructuring Charge Restructuring charges have been recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for the Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, or SFAS No. 146, or SFAS No. 112, Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, or SFAS No. 112, as appropriate. The curtailment gains were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 106 and the curtailment charges were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits. We account for one time termination benefits, contract terminations, asset write offs, and or costs to terminate lease obligations less assumed sublease income in accordance with SFAS No. 146, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with restructuring activities. Under SFAS No. 146, we establish an estimated liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity, including severance and lease termination obligations, and other related costs, when the liability is incurred, rather than at the date that we commit to an exit plan. We reassess the expected cost to complete the exit or disposal activities at the end of each reporting period and adjust our remaining estimated liabilities, if necessary. We record severance related expenses once they are both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 112 for severance costs provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement. 38 Table of Contents The determination of when we accrue for severance costs and which standard applies depends on whether the termination benefits are provided under a one time benefit arrangement as defined by SFAS No. 146 or under an ongoing arrangement as described in SFAS No. 112. Inherent in the estimation of the costs related to the restructurings are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the exit activities. In determining the charges related to the restructurings, we had to make estimates related to the expenses associated with the restructurings. These estimates may vary from actual costs depending, in part, upon factors that may be beyond our control. We will continue to review the status of our restructuring obligations on a quarterly basis and, if appropriate, record changes to these obligations in current operations based on managements most current estimates. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a $31.4 million restructuring charge in connection with Financial Flexibility initiatives. The significant components of these charges included: Severance and termination costs of $27.5 million in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 112 were recorded. Approximately 500 employees are impacted. Of these 500 employees, 245 employees have exited the Company and 255 employees will exit the Company primarily in the first quarter of 2009; and Severance and termination costs of $3.0 million in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 146 were recorded. Approximately 40 employees were impacted. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a $25.1 million restructuring charge in connection with Financial Flexibility initiatives. The significant components of these charges included: Severance and termination costs of $22.7 million in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 146 were recorded. Approximately 315 employees were impacted; and Lease termination obligations, other costs to consolidate or close facilities and other exit costs of $2.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a $25.5 million restructuring charge in connection with Financial Flexibility initiatives. The significant components of these charges and gains included: Severance and termination costs of $15.1 million in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 146 were recorded. Approximately 200 employees were impacted; and Lease termination obligations, other costs to consolidate or close facilities and other exit costs of $10.8 million.

For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Amounts in millions) Revenue: Risk Management Solutions $ 792.4 $ 758.4 $ 725.2 Sales & Marketing Solutions 410.7 389.5 355.8 Internet Solutions 118.0 100.4 83.2 Core U.S. Revenue $ 1,321.1 $ 1,248.3 $ 1,164.2 Operating Income $ 496.5 $ 466.0 $ 425.8 Year ended December 31, 2008 vs. Year ended December 31, 2007 U.S. Overview U.S. core revenue increased $72.8 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase reflects growth in all of our customer solution sets. U.S. Customer Solution Sets On a customer solution set basis, the $72.8 million increase in core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, reflects: Risk Management Solutions A $34.0 million, or 5%, increase in Risk Management Solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2008, Traditional Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 72% of total U.S. Risk Management Solutions, increased 4%. The primary drivers of this growth were: Continued growth of our Preferred Pricing Agreement with DNBi subscription plans, from existing customers who are willing to increase the level of business they do with us, including the customers who previously purchased value added solutions. These subscription plans provide our customers with unlimited use of our Risk Management reports and data, within pre defined ranges, and generally customers commit to an increased level of spend from their historical levels; partially offset by: Lower purchases of our legacy products by our small customers. For the year ended December 31, 2008, Value Added Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 21% of total U.S. Risk Management Solutions, increased 3%. The primary drivers of this growth were: Higher purchases from existing customers of our value added solutions including solutions enabled by our DNBi platform; 44 Table of Contents partially offset by: A shift in product mix to our Preferred Pricing Agreement with DNBi subscription plans (as noted above). For the year ended December 31, 2008, Supply Management Solutions, which accounted for 7% of total U.S. Risk Management Solutions, increased 11%, on a small base. We believe that we will continue to experience a greater percentage of sales on new solutions where revenue will be recognized in subsequent quarters. As a result, we believe that quarterly revenue will continue to be positively impacted by the recognition of deferred revenue from prior quarter sales, offset by the deferral of revenue from current sales into subsequent periods. Sales & Marketing Solutions A $21.2 million, or 5%, increase in Sales & Marketing Solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2008, Traditional Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 38% of total U.S. Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 5%. The increase was primarily due to: Existing customers increasing their annual sales commitment and changing the structure from monthly to upfront annually; and Shift in timing of renewals (primarily from the first quarter of 2009); partially offset by: Lower purchases of our legacy products. For the year ended December 31, 2008, Value Added Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 62% of total U.S. Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 6%. The increase was primarily due to: Increased purchases from existing customers; and Increased revenue associated with our acquisition of Purisma in the fourth quarter of 2007; partially offset by: A slow down in purchases in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the weakening economy, pressure on customer budgets and our execution in the marketplace. Internet Solutions A $17.6 million, or 18%, increase in Internet Solutions. The increase was due to continued growth in subscription revenue in prior quarters and the AllBusiness.com acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2007. U.S. Operating Income U.S. operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $496.5 million, compared to $466.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $30.5 million, or 7%. The increase in operating income was primarily attributed to: An increase in U.S. revenue; 45 Table of Contents partially offset by: Increased costs associated with our acquisitions; and Increased costs associated with investments to enhance our strategic capabilities. Year ended December 31, 2007 vs. Year ended December 31, 2006 U.S. Overview U.S. core revenue increased $84.1 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase reflects growth in all of our customer solution sets. U.S. Customer Solution Sets On a customer solution set basis, the $84.1 million increase in core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, reflects: Risk Management Solutions A $33.2 million, or 5%, increase in Risk Management Solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Traditional Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 73% of total U.S. Risk Management Solutions, increased 5%. The primary drivers of this growth were: Continued growth of our Preferred Pricing Agreement with DNBi subscription plans from existing customers who are willing to increase the level of business they do with us, including the customers who previously purchased value added solutions. These subscription plans provide our customers with unlimited use of our Risk Management reports and data, within pre defined ranges, and generally customers commit to an increased level of spend from their historical levels; and Higher purchase commitments from existing customers; partially offset by: A decrease in purchases of our older legacy solutions primarily due to our customers shifting to our subscription plan solutions; and The expiration in April 2006 of our five year licensing arrangement with Receivable Management Services, Inc. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Value Added Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 21% of total U.S. Risk Management Solutions, increased 1%. The primary drivers of this growth were: Higher purchases from our existing customers; partially offset by: A shift in product mix to our Preferred Pricing Agreement with DNBi subscription plans (as noted above); and A decline in revenue as a result of the expiration in April 2006 of a five year outsourcing arrangement entered into in connection with the five year licensing arrangement referenced above. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Supply Management Solutions, which accounted for 6% of total U.S. Risk Management Solutions, increased 15%, on a small base. 46 Table of Contents We believe that we will continue to experience a greater percentage of sales on new solutions where revenue will be recognized in subsequent quarters. As a result, we believe that quarterly revenue will continue to be positively impacted by the recognition of deferred revenue from prior quarter sales, offset by the deferral of revenue from current sales into subsequent periods. Sales & Marketing Solutions A $33.7 million, or 10%, increase in Sales & Marketing Solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Traditional Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 39% of total U.S. Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 3%. The increase was primarily driven by higher commitments from our existing customers, new customer acquisitions and revenue associated with our acquisition of the Education Division of Automation Research, Inc. d/b/a MKTG Services. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Value Added Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 61% of total U.S. Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 14%. The increase was primarily driven by higher purchases from our existing customers resulting from our global business marketing information database powered by Acxioms grid computing platform. Internet Solutions A $17.2 million, or 21%, increase in Internet Solutions, primarily representing the results of Hoovers. The increase was driven by continued growth in subscription revenue at Hoovers and our acquisitions of First Research and AllBusiness.com, Inc. U.S. Operating Income U.S. operating income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $466.0 million, compared to $425.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $40.2 million, or 10%. The increase in operating income was primarily attributed to: An increase in U.S. revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007; partially offset by: Increased costs associated with our strategic investments; and Increased costs associated with our recent acquisitions. International International represented 23%, 22% and 21% of our core revenue for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Market Risk We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of certain of our investments. We employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies. We use short term foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge short term foreign currency denominated loans, investments and certain third party and intercompany transactions and, from time to time, we have used foreign exchange option contracts to reduce our International earnings exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, from time to time, we use interest rate instruments to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure on our outstanding fixed rate notes, as discussed under Interest Rate Risk below. 51 Table of Contents A discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Interest Rate Risk Management In December 2008, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with aggregate notional amounts of $75 million, and designated these swaps as cash flow hedges against variability in cash flows related to our bank revolving credit facility. These transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value of the hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI. Approximately $0.6 million of net derivative losses associated with these swaps was included in AOCI at December 31, 2008. In January 2008, we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of $400 million. The objective of these hedges was to mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in Treasury rates in the anticipation of the below referenced debt issuance. These transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of debt issuance were recorded in AOCI. In connection with the issuance of the senior notes with a face value of $400 million that mature on April 1, 2013 notes, bearing interest at an annual rate of 6.00%, payable semi annually (the 2013 notes), these interest rate derivative transactions were executed, resulting in a payment of $8.5 million at the date of termination. The payments are recorded in AOCI, and will be amortized over the life of the 2013 notes. In April 2008, we issued the 2013 notes. In September 2005 and February 2006, we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of $200 million and $100 million, respectively. The objective of these hedges was to mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in Treasury rates in the anticipation of the below referenced debt issuance. These transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges, and as such, changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of debt issuance were recorded in AOCI. In connection with the issuance of senior notes (the 2011 notes), these interest rate derivative transactions were executed, resulting in proceeds of approximately $5.0 million at the date of termination. The proceeds are recorded in AOCI and will be amortized over the life of the 2011 notes. At December 31, 2006, we had a $300 million bank revolving credit facility available at prevailing short term interest rates, which we terminated on April 19, 2007, and then entered into a new $500 million, five year bank revolving credit facility, which expires in April 2012. On January 25, 2008, we exercised a $150 million expansion feature on our $500 million credit facility expanding the total facility to $650 million. Borrowings under the $650 million credit facility are available at prevailing short term interest rates. At December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, we had $203.4 million and $425.3 million of floating rate debt outstanding under the facility, respectively. A 100 basis point increase/decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding variable rate debt at December 31, 2008, would result in an incremental increase/decrease in annual interest expense of approximately $1 million. Foreign Exchange Risk Management We have numerous offices in countries outside the U.S. and conduct operations in various countries through minority equity investments and strategic relationships with local providers. Our International operations generated approximately 23% and 22% of our core revenue for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Approximately 37% and 35% of our assets as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were located outside the U.S. 52 Table of Contents Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings, cash flows and financial position of our International operations. We follow a policy of hedging balance sheet positions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries. In addition, we are subject to foreign exchange risk associated with our International earnings and investments. We use short term, foreign exchange forward and option contracts to implement our hedging strategies. Typically, these contracts have maturities of twelve months or less. These contracts are denominated primarily in the British pound sterling, the Euro and Canadian dollar. The gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with the balance sheet positions hedge are recorded in Other Income (Expense) Net in our consolidated financial statements and are essentially offset by the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency transactions. As in prior years, we have hedged substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries with short term forward foreign exchange contracts. In addition, from time to time, we use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain foreign earnings and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain net investment positions. The underlying transactions and the corresponding forward exchange and option contracts are mark to market at the end of each quarter and are reflected within our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, we did not have any option contracts outstanding. At December 31, 2007, there were $54.1 million in option contracts outstanding. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had a notional amount of approximately $254.5 million and $185.4 million, respectively, of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding that offset foreign currency denominated loans. Realized gains and losses associated with these contracts were $16.2 million and $41.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008; $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007; and $0.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Unrealized gains and losses associated with these contracts were $0.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008; $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007; and $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006. If exchange rates were to increase on average 10% from year end levels, without the benefit of having hedging activities, the unrealized loss would be approximately $13 million. If exchange rates on average were to decrease 10% from year end levels, without the benefit of having hedging activities, the unrealized gain would be approximately $10 million. However, the estimated potential gain and loss on these contracts is expected to be substantially offset by changes in the dollar value of the underlying transactions. Liquidity and Financial Position In connection with our focus on delivering Total Shareholder Return or TSR, we will remain disciplined in the use of our shareholders cash, maintaining three key priorities for the use of this cash: First, making ongoing investments in the business to drive growth; Second, investing in acquisitions that we believe will be value accretive to enhance our capabilities and accelerate our growth; and Third, continuing to return cash to shareholders. We believe that cash provided by operating activities, supplemented as needed with available financing arrangements, is sufficient to meet our short term needs (twelve months or less), including the cash cost of restructuring charges, transition costs, contractual obligations and contingencies (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K), excluding the legal matters identified in said note for which exposures cannot be estimated or are not probable. In addition, we believe that 53 Table of Contents our ability to readily access the bank and capital markets for incremental financing needs will enable us to meet our continued focus on TSR. We have the ability to access the short term borrowings market from time to time to fund working capital needs, acquisitions and share repurchases. Such borrowings would be supported by our credit facility, when needed. The recent and unprecedented disruption in the current economic environment has had a significant adverse impact on a number of commercial and financial institutions. At this point in time, our liquidity has not been impacted by the current credit environment and management does not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. Management will continue to closely monitor our liquidity, the credit markets and our financial counterparties. However, management cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment. The following discussions are on a continuing operations basis and therefore exclude the results of the Italian real estate business. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Cash Provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations Net cash provided by operating activities was $433.9 million, $384.6 million and $290.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Year ended December 31, 2008 vs. Year ended December 31, 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $49.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily driven by: Increased net income of our underlying business excluding the impact of non cash gains and losses; A decrease in restructuring payments associated with our Financial Flexibility initiatives compared to the prior period; and Increased collections; partially offset by: An increase in both tax payments and interest expense payments compared to prior period. Year ended December 31, 2007 vs. Year ended December 31, 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $93.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily driven by: Increased net income of our underlying business excluding the impact of non cash gains and losses; Increased collections resulting from the timing of sales. Fourth quarter sales in 2007 occurred earlier in the quarter as compared to sales later in the fourth quarter of 2006; A lower SFAS 123R windfall reclassification from net cash flows from operating activities to cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, due to a decrease in the volume of stock option exercises in the current period; A decline in our other long term assets primarily due to a deposit made to the IRS in 2006 to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies related to the legacy tax matters discussed in Note 13 Contingencies (Tax Matters) to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, partially offset by higher 2007 pension income; and Timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities (e.g., royalty, relocation, our D&B Worldwide Network and data related expenses); 54 Table of Contents partially offset by: An increase in restructuring payments compared to the prior period. Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities from Continuing Operations Net cash used in investing activities was $154.5 million and $216.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities was $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Year ended December 31, 2008 vs. Year ended December 31, 2007 Net cash used in investing activities was $154.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $216.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $61.9 million decrease primarily reflects the following activities: During the year ended December 31, 2008, in connection with our initiatives to drive long term growth, we spent $69.2 million on acquisitions/majority owned joint ventures and other investments, net of cash acquired, as compared to $146.5 million, net of cash acquired, during the year ended December 31, 2007. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information; A decrease in capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles, which was primarily used to fund software development, product and platform enhancements across all three of our solution sets. The decrease of $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007 was primarily driven by a longer software product development cycle in 2008 versus 2007. The decrease in capital expenditures is related to approximately $6.1 million of furniture and equipment primarily related to our Center Valley, Pennsylvania facility, which was included in accounts payable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006, and was paid for in the year ended December 31, 2007; and During the year ended December 31, 2008, we received approximately $9.0 million in cash from the sale of our Italian real estate business on December 27, 2007; partially offset by: Cash settlements of our foreign currency contracts for our hedged transactions resulted in cash outflows of $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to cash outflows of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Year ended December 31, 2007 vs. Year ended December 31, 2006 Net cash used in investing activities was $216.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $264.5 million decrease primarily reflects the following activities: During the year ended December 31, 2007, in connection with our initiatives to drive long term growth, we spent $146.5 million on acquisitions/majority owned joint ventures and other investments, net of cash acquired, as compared to $9.6 million, net of cash acquired, during the year ended December 31, 2006. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information; During the year ended December 31, 2006, we had net redemptions of marketable securities of $109.4 million. We did not have any investments or redemptions of marketable securities during the year ended December 31, 2007; and 55 Table of Contents Capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles increased $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily driven by increased investments, such as DNBi, DUNSRight Quality Process and Acxiom in our U.S. segment and our capital investments, primarily for enhancements in the D&B Worldwide Network in our International segment. Cash Used in Financing Activities from Continuing Operations Net cash used in financing activities was $242.5 million, $143.0 million and $431.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As set forth below for all these years, these changes primarily relate to contractual obligations, payments of dividends, stock based proceeds from stock option exercises, share repurchases and spin off obligations. Contractual Obligations Debt In March 2006, we issued senior notes with a face value of $300 million that mature on March 15, 2011, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 5.50%, payable semi annually (the 2011 notes). The proceeds were used to repay our then existing $300 million senior notes bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.625%, payable semi annually, which matured in March 2006. On September 30, 2005 and February 10, 2006, we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of $200 million and $100 million, respectively. The objective of these hedges was to mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in Treasury rates in the anticipation of the issuance of the 2011 notes. These transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of the issuance of the 2011 notes were recorded in AOCI. In connection with the issuance of the 2011 notes, these interest rate derivative transactions were executed, resulting in proceeds of approximately $5.0 million at the date of termination. The proceeds are recorded in AOCI and are being amortized over the life of the 2011 notes. In April 2008, we issued 2013 notes with a face value of $400 million that mature on April 1, 2013, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.00%, payable semi annually. The proceeds from this issuance were used to repay indebtedness under our credit facility. On January 30, 2008, we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of $400 million. The objective of these hedges was to mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in Treasury rates in anticipation of the issuance of the 2013 notes. These transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of the issuance of the 2013 notes were recorded in AOCI. In connection with the issuance of the 2013 notes, these interest rate derivative transactions were executed, resulting in a payment of $8.5 million at the date of termination. The payments are recorded in AOCI, and are being amortized over the life of the 2013 notes. Credit Facility At December 31, 2006, we had a $300 million bank revolving credit facility, which we terminated on April 19, 2007, and entered into a $500 million, five year bank revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2007, we had a $500 million, five year bank revolving credit facility, which expires in April 2012. Borrowings under the $500 million credit facility are available at prevailing short term interest rates. On January 25, 2008, we exercised a $150 million expansion feature on our $500 million credit facility expanding the total facility to $650 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $203.4 million of borrowings 56 Table of Contents outstanding under the $650 million credit facility. At December 31, 2007, we had $425.3 million of borrowings outstanding under the $500 million credit facility. We borrowed under these facilities from time to time during the year ended December 31, 2008 to fund our share repurchases, acquisition strategy and working capital needs. Dividends The total amount of dividends paid during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $65.6 million and $58.4 million, respectively. We did not pay any dividends on our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2006. Stock based Programs For the year ended December 31, 2008, net proceeds from stock based awards were $23.8 million compared to $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease in the volume of stock option exercises in 2008 as compared to the prior period. For the year ended December 31, 2007, net proceeds from stock based awards were $31.3 million compared to $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease in the volume of stock option exercises in 2007 as compared to the prior period. Share Repurchases During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased 4.4 million shares of common stock for $381.9 million under our share repurchase programs. The share repurchases are comprised of the following programs: In December 2007, our Board of Directors approved a $400 million, two year share repurchase program, which commenced in February 2008. We repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for $272.7 million under this share repurchase program during the year ended December 31, 2008.

This program was completed in February 2008; and In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a four year, five million share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of the shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. We repurchased 0.9 million shares of common stock for $82.4 million under this program during the year ended December 31, 2008. This program expires in August 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased 4.5 million shares of common stock for $408.5 million under our share repurchase programs. The share repurchases are comprised of the following programs: In May 2007, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million, one year share repurchase program, which began in July 2007 upon the completion of the then existing $200 million program. We purchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $173.2 million under the new $200 million program during the year ended December 31, 2007. This program was completed in February 2008; In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million, one year share repurchase program which began in October 2006. We repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $125.0 million under this program during the year ended December 31, 2007. This program was completed in July 2007; and In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a four year, five million share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of the shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. We repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock for $110.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. This program expires in August 2010. 57 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of common stock for $662.7 million. The share repurchases are comprised of the following programs: In January 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $100 million to our then existing $400 million, two year share repurchase program announced in February 2005. We repurchased 4.2 million shares of common stock for $300.0 million under this program during the year ended December 31, 2006. This program was completed in September 2006; In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million, one year share repurchase program which began in October 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 0.9 million shares of common stock for $75.0 million under this share repurchase program; In July 2003, our Board of Directors approved a three year, six million share repurchase program to mitigate dilution under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. This program was completed in August 2006.

We repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for $87.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. Spin off Obligations As part of our spin off from Moodys/The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (D&B2) in 2000, Moodys and D&B entered into a Tax Allocation Agreement dated as of September 30, 2000 (the TAA). During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we did not make a payment to Moodys/D&B2 under the TAA. We made payments of $20.9 million to Moodys/D&B2 during the year ended December 31, 2006 under the TAA which was fully accrued as of December 31, 2005. See Future Liquidity Sources and Uses of Funds for further details. Future Liquidity Sources and Uses of Funds Contractual Cash Obligations The following table quantifies, as of December 31, 2008, our contractual obligations that will require the use of cash in the future. Contractual Obligations(a) Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter All Other (Amounts in millions) Long Term Debt(1) $ 1,047.8 $ 42.5 $ 42.5 $ 328.7 $ 228.0 $ 406.1 $ $ Operating Leases(2) $ 129.6 $ 28.8 $ 22.5 $ 19.8 $ 16.3 $ 12.0 $ 30.2 $ Obligations to Outsourcers(3) $ 366.0 $ 123.1 $ 100.6 $ 95.4 $ 45.8 $ 1.1 $ $ Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Payments/Contributions(4) $ 853.4 $ 35.0 $ 36.4 $ 39.4 $ 30.5 $ 29.4 $ 682.7 $ Spin off Obligation(5) $ 21.2 $ 21.2 $ $ $ $ $ $ Unrecognized Tax Benefits(6) $ 92.5 $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 92.5 (a) Because their future cash flows are uncertain, noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the table. (1) Primarily represents our senior notes with a face value of $300 million that mature in March 2011, net of a $0.3 million discount, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 5.50%, payable semi annually, borrowings 58 Table of Contents outstanding under our bank credit facility at short term interest rates and our senior notes with a face value of $400 million that mature in April 2013, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.00%, payable semi annually. Amounts include the interest portion on future obligations. Interest rate on our senior notes is presented using the stated interest rate. Interest expense on our bank credit facility is estimated using the rate in effect as of December 31, 2008. (2) Most of our operations are conducted from leased facilities, which are under operating leases that expire over the next ten years, with the majority expiring within five years. We also lease certain computer and other equipment under operating leases that expire over the next three and five years, respectively. These computer and other equipment leases are frequently renegotiated or otherwise changed as the lease terms expire and as advancements in computer technology present opportunities to lower costs and improve performance. (3) In July 2002, we outsourced certain technology functions to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) under a 10 year agreement, which we may terminate for a fee at any time and under certain other conditions. Under the terms of the agreement, CSC is responsible for the data center operations, technology help desk and network management functions in the U.S. and UK and for certain application development and maintenance through July 31, 2012. This agreement was amended in March 2008, which, among other things, increased certain of the services level agreements that CSC is required to provide under the Technology Services Agreement and added additional security services to be performed by CSC. The obligation under the contract is based on our historical and expected future level of usage and volume. If our future volume changes, payments under the contract could vary up or down based on specified formulas. Charges are subject to increases to partially offset inflation. We incurred costs of $77.6 million, $80.4 million, and $76.1 million under this contract for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In December 2003, we signed a three year agreement with ICT Group, Inc. (ICT), effective January 2004, to outsource certain marketing call center activities, which contains two renewal options for up to a one year period. The agreement was amended effective September 2007 to be extended through 2011. Under the terms of the agreement, ICT will be responsible for performing certain marketing and credit calling activities previously performed by our own call centers in North America. The obligation under the contract is based upon transmitted call volumes, but shall not be less than $3 million per contract year. We incurred costs of $3.2 million, $4.5 million and $4.1 million under this contract for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In October 2004, we signed a seven year outsourcing agreement with International Business Machines (IBM). Under the terms of the agreement, we have transitioned certain portions of our data acquisition and delivery, customer service and financial processes to IBM. We may terminate this agreement for a fee at any time. We incurred costs of $30.1 million, $30.7 million and $25.5 million under this contract for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In July 2006, we signed a four year product and technology outsourcing agreement with Acxiom Corporation in order to significantly increase the speed, data processing capacity and matching capabilities we provide our U.S. sales and marketing customers. In November 2008, we extended the term of the outsourcing agreement through 2011. In addition, in November 2008 we also entered into an agreement that will expand our service capabilities, enhance customer experience and accelerate the migration of the remaining existing D&B fulfilled processes to Acxiom. We incurred fulfillment costs of $7.5 million, $6.6 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. (4) Represents projected contributions to our non U.S. defined benefit plans as well as projected benefit payments related to our unfunded plans, including the U.S. Non Qualified Plans and our postretirement benefit plan. We do not expect to make any contributions to our U.S. Qualified Plan. The expected benefits are estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure our benefit obligation at the end of 2008 and include benefits attributable to estimated future employee service. A closed group approach is used in calculating the projected benefit payments, assuming only the participants who are currently in the valuation population are included in the projection and the projected benefits continue for up to approximately 99 years. 59 Table of Contents (5) As part of our spin off from Moodys/D&B2 in 2000, Moodys/D&B2 and D&B entered into a TAA. Under the TAA, Moodys/D&B2 and D&B agreed that Moodys/D&B2 would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with the exercise of Moodys stock options (including Moodys stock options exercised by D&B employees) and D&B would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with the exercise of D&B stock options (including D&B stock options exercised by employees of Moodys/D&B2). Put simply, the tax deduction would go to the company that granted the stock options, rather than to the employer of the individual exercising the stock options. The TAA provides, however, that if the IRS issues rules, regulations or other authority contrary to the agreed upon treatment of the compensation expense deductions under the TAA, then the party that becomes entitled under such guidance to take the deduction may be required to reimburse the tax benefit it has realized, in order to compensate the other party for its loss of such deduction. In 2002 and 2003, the IRS issued rulings that appear to provide that, under the circumstances applicable to Moodys/D&B2 and D&B, the compensation expense deduction belongs to the employer of the option grantee and not to the issuer of the option (i.e., D&B would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with D&B employees exercising Moodys/D&B2 options and Moodys/D&B2 would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with Moodys/D&B2 employees exercising D&B options). We have filed tax returns for 2001 through 2007, and made estimated tax deposits for 2008, consistent with the IRS rulings. We received (or believe we are due) the benefit of additional tax deductions, and under the TAA we may be required to reimburse Moodys/D&B2 for the loss of income tax deductions relating to tax years 2003 to 2008 of approximately $21.2 million in the aggregate for such years. We have paid over the years to Moodys/D&B2 approximately $30.1 million under the TAA. We did not make any payments during the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. We may also be required to pay additional amounts in the future based upon interpretations by the parties of the TAA and the IRS rulings, timing of future exercises of stock options, the future price of stock underlying the stock options and relevant tax rates. As of December 31, 2008, current and former employees of D&B held 0.3 million Moodys stock options. These stock options had a weighted average exercise price of $10.96 and a remaining weighted average contractual life of one year. All of these stock options are currently exercisable. We and Moodys are trying to amicably resolve this matter. (6) We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, or FIN 48, as of January 1, 2007. We have a total amount of unrecognized tax benefits of $108.6 million for the year ending December 31, 2008. Although we do not anticipate payments within the next twelve months for these matters, these could require the aggregate use of cash totaling approximately $92.5 million. As we can not make reliable estimates regarding the timing of the cash flows by period, we have included FIN 48 liabilities within the All Other column in the table above. Capital Structure Every year we examine our capital structure and review our plans. During 2009, in connection with our focus on TSR, we anticipate continued share repurchases and cash dividends. We believe that cash provided by operating activities, supplemented as needed with readily available financing arrangements, is sufficient to meet our short term needs, including the cash cost of restructuring charges, transition costs, contractual obligations and contingencies, excluding the legal matters identified herein for which exposures cannot be estimated. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. As we execute our long term TSR strategy, which contemplates strategic acquisitions, we may require or consider additional financing to fund our TSR strategy. We regularly evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile and various financing alternatives for opportunities to enhance our capital structure. While we feel confident that such financing arrangements are available to us, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to access new sources of liquidity when required. 60 Table of Contents The recent and unprecedented disruption in the current economic environment has had a significant adverse impact on a number of commercial and financial institutions. At this point in time, our liquidity has not been impacted by the current credit environment and management does not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. Management will continue to closely monitor our liquidity, the credit markets and our financial counterparties. However, management cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment. Share Repurchases and Dividends In order to mitigate the dilutive effect of the shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP, our Board of Directors approved in August 2006, a four year, five million share repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased 0.9 million shares of common stock for $82.4 million under this program with 1.8 million shares remaining to be repurchased. In May 2007, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million, one year share repurchase program which commenced in July 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased 0.3 million shares of common stock of $26.8 million under this share repurchase program. This program was completed in February 2008. In December 2007, our Board of Directors approved a $400 million, two year share repurchase program, which commenced in February 2008. During the year ended December, 2008, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for $272.7 million under this program with $127.3 million remaining under this program. We anticipate that the $400 million repurchase program will be completed by February 2010. In February 2009, our Board of Directors approved a new $200 million share repurchase program. This new program will begin at the completion of our existing $400 million, two year share repurchase program. We are targeting our discretionary share repurchases of approximately $100 million to $150 million in 2009. In January 2009, our Board of Directors approved the declaration of a dividend of $0.34 per share for the first quarter of 2009. This cash dividend will be payable on March 20, 2009 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 6, 2009. Potential Payments in Tax and Legal Matters We and our predecessors are involved in certain tax and legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. These matters are at various stages of resolution, but could ultimately result in significant cash payments as described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We believe we have adequate reserves recorded in our consolidated financial statements for our share of current exposures in these matters, where applicable, as described therein. Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefit Plan Contribution Requirements For financial statement reporting purposes, the funded status of our pension plans, as determined in accordance with GAAP, had a deficit of $155.5 million, $235.8 million and $45.9 million for the U.S. Qualified Plan, the U.S. Non Qualified Plans and the non U.S. plans at December 31, 2008, as compared to a surplus of $274.7 million for the U.S. Qualified Plan, a deficit of $217.1 million for the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, and a deficit of $60.0 million for the non U.S. plans at December 31, 2007. The deterioration in the funded status of the U.S. plans was primarily due to significant asset loss in 2008 and lower discount rate at December 31, 2008. The improvement in the funded status of the non U.S. plans was primarily due to a lower projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2008, primarily driven by a higher discount rate and positive impact from change in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher asset loss in 2008. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. During fiscal 2008, we were not required to make contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan, the largest of our six plans, under funding regulations associated with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA 2006) as the plan was considered fully funded for the 2007 plan year. We do not expect to make any contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan in fiscal 2009 for the 2008 plan year. In addition, we are not required to make quarterly contributions for the 2009 plan year. Final funding requirements for fiscal 2009 will be determined based on our January 2009 funding actuarial valuation. 61 Table of Contents We expect to continue to make cash contributions to our other pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2009. The expected 2009 contribution is approximately $25.3 million, compared to $23.0 million in 2008. In addition, we expect to make benefit payments related to our postretirement benefit plan of approximately $9.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $6.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. See the Contractual Cash Obligations table above for projected contributions and benefit payments beyond 2009. In addition, we expect 2009 cash contributions to the 401(k) Plan to be in the range of approximately $7 million to $18 million compared to $19.2 million in 2008. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for changes to our 401(k) Plan. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Related Party Transactions We do not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off balance sheet arrangements except for those disclosed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Additionally, we have not engaged in any significant related party transactions. Fair Value Measurements As described in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, effective January 1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, or SFAS No. 157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and expands fair value measurement disclosures. However, we have deferred the application of SFAS No. 157 related to non recurring non financial assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2008, we did not have any unobservable (Level 3) inputs in determining fair value. Forward Looking Statements We may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in reports to shareholders and in press releases and investor Web casts. These forward looking statements can be identified by the use of words like anticipates, aspirations, believes, continues, estimates, expects, goals, guidance, intends, plans, projects, strategy, targets, commits, will and other words of similar meaning. They can also be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and whether to invest in, or remain invested in, our securities. In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying in the following paragraphs important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements: We rely significantly on third parties to support critical components of our business model in a continuous and high quality manner, including third party data providers, strategic third party members in our D&B Worldwide Network, and third parties with whom we have outsourcing arrangements; 62 Table of Contents Demand for our products is subject to intense competition, changes in customer preferences and economic conditions which impact customer behavior; Our solutions and brand image are dependent upon the integrity and security of our global database and the continued availability thereof through the internet and by other means, as well as our ability to protect key assets, such as our data centers; Our ability to maintain the integrity of our brand and reputation, which we believe are key assets and competitive advantages; Our ability to renew large contracts, the related revenue recognition and the timing thereof may impact our results of operations from period to period; As a result of the credit market crisis and other macro economic challenges currently affecting the global economy, our customers or vendors may experience cash flow problems.
