Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations How We Manage Our Business For internal management purposes, we refer to core revenue, which we calculate as total operating revenue less the revenue of divested businesses. Core revenue is used to manage and evaluate the performance of our segments and to allocate resources because this measure provides an indication of the underlying changes in revenue in a single performance measure. Core revenue does not include reported revenue of divested businesses since they are not included in future revenue. On May 29, 2009, we completed the sale of substantially all the assets and liabilities of the domestic portion of our Italian operations. This sale has been classified as a Divestiture. Our divested business contributed 1% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 3% of our total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. See Note 14 and Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further detail. We also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because we believe it is useful for investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another, both with and without the effects of foreign exchange. As a result, we monitor our core revenue growth both after and before the effects of foreign exchange. Core revenue growth excluding the effects of foreign exchange is referred to as revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange. From time to time we have analyzed and we may continue to further analyze core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange among two components, organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions. We analyze organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions because management believes this information provides an important insight into the underlying health of our business. Core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition. We evaluate the performance of our business segments based on segment revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange, and segment operating income growth before certain types of gains and charges that we consider do not reflect our underlying business performance. Specifically, for management reporting purposes, we evaluate business segment performance before non core gains and charges because such charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations. A recurring component of non core gains and charges are our restructuring charges, which result from a foundational element of our growth strategy that we refer to as Financial Flexibility. Through Financial Flexibility, management identifies opportunities to improve the performance of the business in terms of reallocating our spending from low growth or low value activities to activities that will create greater value for shareholders through enhanced revenue growth, improved profitability and or quality improvements. Management is committed through this process to examining how every dollar is spent, and optimizing between variable and fixed costs to ensure flexibility in changes to our operating expense base as we make strategic choices. This enables us to continually and systematically identify improvement opportunities in terms of quality, cost and customer experience. Such charges are variable from period to period based upon actions identified and taken during each period. Management reviews operating results before such charges on a monthly basis and establishes internal budgets and forecasts based upon such measures. Management further establishes annual and long term compensation such as salaries, target cash bonuses and target equity compensation amounts based on such measures and a significant percentage weight is placed upon such measures before such charges in determining whether performance objectives have been achieved. Management believes that by eliminating restructuring charges from such financial measures, and by being overt to shareholders about the results of our operations excluding such charges, business leaders are provided incentives to recommend and execute actions that are in the best long term interests of our shareholders, rather than being influenced by the potential impact a charge in a particular period could have on their compensation. Additionally, transition costs (period costs such as consulting fees, costs of temporary employees, relocation costs and stay bonuses incurred to implement the Financial Flexibility component of our strategy) are reported as 25 Table of Contents Corporate and Other expenses and are not allocated to our business segments. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for financial information regarding our segments. Similarly, when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole, we focus on results (such as operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, net income, tax rate and diluted earnings per share) before non core gains and charges because such non core gains and charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations and may drive behavior that does not ultimately maximize shareholder value. Additionally, for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, our non GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America) measures reflect results on a continuing operations basis. It may be concluded from our presentation of non core gains and charges that the items that result in non core gains and charges may occur in the future. We monitor free cash flow as a measure of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles. Free cash flow measures our available cash flow for potential debt repayment, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividend payments and additions to cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. We believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating the funding available after supporting our ongoing business operations and our portfolio of product investments. Free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute measure for, or superior to, net cash flows provided by operating activities, investing activities or financing activities. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, we evaluate our North America Risk Management Solutions based on two metrics: (1) subscription, and non subscription, and (2) DNBi and non DNBi. We define subscription as contracts that allow customers unlimited use within predefined ranges, subject to certain conditions. In these instances, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract, which is generally one year and non subscription as all other revenue streams. We define DNBi as our interactive, customizable online application that offers our customers real time access to our most complete and up to date global DUNSRight information, comprehensive monitoring and portfolio analysis and non DNBi as all other revenue streams. Management believes these measures provide further insight into our performance and growth of our North America Risk Management Solutions revenue. The adjustments discussed herein to our results as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods, to allocate resources, to evaluate business performance and, as noted above, for compensation purposes. However, these financial measures (e.g., results before non core gains and charges and free cash flow) are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue, operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, net income, tax rate, diluted earnings per share, or net cash provided by operating activities, investing activities and financing activities prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, it should be noted that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly, or at all, the presentation of these financial measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies. See Results of Operations below for a discussion of our results reported on a GAAP basis. Overview As of January 1, 2009, Canada has been moved out of our International segment and into our renamed North America segment (formerly our United States (U.S.) segment). Therefore, on January 1, 2009, we 26 Table of Contents began managing our operations through the following two segments: North America (which consists of the U.S. and Canada) and International (which consists of our operations in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America). We have conformed historical amounts to reflect the new segment structure. The financial statements of our subsidiaries outside of North America reflect a fiscal year ended November 30 to facilitate the timely reporting of our consolidated financial results and financial position. The following table presents the contribution by segment to core revenue and total revenue: For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Core Revenue: North America 79 % 81 % 83 % International 21 % 19 % 17 % Total Revenue: North America 78 % 79 % 81 % International 22 % 21 % 19 % The following table presents the contribution by customer solution set to core revenue and total revenue: For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Core Revenue by Customer Solution Set: Risk Management Solutions 65 % 64 % 64 % Sales & Marketing Solutions 28 % 29 % 29 % Internet Solutions 7 % 7 % 7 % Total Revenue by Customer Solution Set(1): Risk Management Solutions 64 % 62 % 62 % Sales & Marketing Solutions 28 % 28 % 28 % Internet Solutions 7 % 7 % 7 % (1) Our divested business contributed 1% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 3% of our total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. These customer solution sets are discussed in greater detail in Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.

Of those policies, we consider the policies described below to be critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require managements subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 28 Table of Contents If actual results in a given period ultimately differ from previous estimates, the actual results could have a material impact on such period. We have discussed the selection and application of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure regarding critical accounting policies and estimates as well as the other sections in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Launches Accounting Standards Codification In June 2009, the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Codification TM (ASC) 105 10, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or ASC 105 10 (the Codification). This authoritative guidance establishes the exclusive authoritative reference for GAAP for use in financial statements, except for Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and interpretative releases, which are also authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification supersedes all existing non SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other grandfathered, non SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification is nonauthoritative. Following the Codification, the FASB will not issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts. Instead, it will issue Accounting Standards Updates (ASU), which will serve to update the Codification, provide background information about the authoritative guidance and provide the basis for conclusions on the changes to the Codification. GAAP is not intended to be changed as a result of the Codification, but it has changed the way the authoritative guidance is organized and presented. As a result, these changes made an impact on how we reference GAAP in our financial statements and in our accounting policies. Where appropriate, we have conformed, throughout this Form 10 K, references to both the Codification and or the previous GAAP source reference. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations Through June 30, 2007, we offered to substantially all of our U.S. based employees coverage under a defined benefit plan called The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation Retirement Account (U.S. Qualified Plan). The defined benefit plan covered active and retired employees including retired individuals from spin off companies (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further discussion of spin off companies). The benefits to be paid upon retirement are based on a percentage of the employees annual compensation. The percentage of compensation allocated annually to a retirement account ranged from 3% to 12.5% based on age and service. Amounts allocated under the plan also receive interest credits based on the 30 year Treasury rate or equivalent rate published by the Internal Revenue Service. Pension costs are determined actuarially and funded in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. We also maintain supplemental and excess plans in the United States (U.S. Non Qualified Plans) to provide additional retirement benefits to certain key employees of the Company. These plans are unfunded, pay as you go plans. The U.S. Qualified Plan and the U.S. Non Qualified Plans account for approximately 70% and 15% of our pension obligation, respectively, at December 31, 2009. Effective June 30, 2007, we amended the U.S. Qualified Plan and one of the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, known as the U.S. Pension Benefit Equalization Plan (the PBEP). Any pension benefit that had been accrued through such date under the two plans was frozen at its then current value and no additional benefits, other than interest on such amounts, will accrue under the U.S. Qualified Plan and the PBEP. Our employees in certain of our international operations are also provided retirement benefits through defined benefit plans, representing the remaining balance of our pension obligations. We also provide various health care and life insurance benefits for retirees. U.S. based employees, who retire with 10 years of vesting service after age 45, are eligible to receive benefits. Postretirement benefit costs 29 Table of Contents and obligations are determined actuarially. Effective March 1, 2010, we will eliminate company paid life insurance benefits for retirees. In addition, we will only share the minimum necessary amount of subsidy received from the government in any year to maintain actuarial equivalence for as long as possible. The key assumptions used in the measurement of the pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement cost are: Expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets which is based on a target asset allocation as well as expected returns on asset categories of plan investments; Discount rate which is used to measure the present value of pension plan obligations and postretirement health care obligations. The discount rates are derived using a yield curve approach which matches projected plan benefit payment streams with bond portfolios, reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans; Rates of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation/conversion rates which are based on an evaluation of internal plans and external market indicators; and Health care cost trends which are based on historical cost data, the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends. We believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, though changes in these assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The factor with the most immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements is a change in the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets for the U.S. Qualified Plan. For 2010, we will continue to use an expected long term rate of return of 8.25%. This assumption was 8.25% in each of the years 2009, 2008 and 2007. The 8.25% assumption represents our best estimate of the expected long term future investment performance of the U.S. Qualified Plan, after considering expectations for future capital market returns and the plans asset allocation. As of December 31, 2009 the U.S. Qualified Plan was 65% invested in publicly traded equity securities, 30% invested in debt securities and 5% invested in real estate investments. Every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the long term rate of return increases or reduces our annual operating income by approximately $3 million by increasing or reducing our net periodic pension income. Changes in the discount rate, rate of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation/conversion rates also have an effect on our annual operating income. Based on the factors noted above, the discount rate is adjusted at each remeasurement date while other assumptions are reviewed annually. For our U.S. plans, every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our pension cost by approximately $0.5 million. The discount rate used to determine pension cost for our U.S. pension plans was 6.10%, 6.37% and 5.84% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For 2010, we decreased the discount rate to 5.72% from 6.10% for all our U.S. pension plans. Differences between the assumptions stated above and actual experience could affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. These gains and losses are aggregated and amortized generally over the average future service periods or life expectancy of plan participants to the extent that such gains or losses exceed a corridor. The purpose of the corridor is to reduce the volatility caused by the difference between actual experience and the pension related assumptions noted above, on a plan by plan basis. For all of our pension plans, total actuarial losses that have not been recognized in our pension costs as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $887.7 million and $855.2 million, respectively, of which $672.2 million and $682.1 million, respectively, were attributable to the U.S. Qualified Plan, $105.0 million and $89.5 million, respectively, were attributable to the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, and the remainder was attributable to the non U.S. pension plans. (See discussion in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.) We expect to recognize a portion of such losses in our 2010 net periodic pension cost of approximately $12 million, $6 million and $3 million, for the U.S. Qualified Plan, U.S. Non Qualified Plans and non U.S. plans, respectively, compared to $15.8 million, $5.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in 2009. The lower amortization of 30 Table of Contents actuarial loss in 2010 for the U.S. Qualified plan, which will be included in our pension cost in 2010, is primarily due to a change, starting in November 2009 (according to our accounting policy), in amortization period from average future service years of active participants to average life expectancy of all plan participants. The decrease is substantially offset by the impact of a larger unrecognized actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010. Higher amortization of actuarial loss in 2010 for our U.S. Non Qualified Plans and non U.S. plans was primarily due to lower discount rates applied to the plan at December 31, 2009, as well as a larger unrecognized actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010. Differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could affect our net periodic pension cost. For our pension plans, we recorded net pension periodic cost of $6.0 million, net pension periodic income of $3.7 million and net pension periodic cost of $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. A major component of the net pension periodic cost is the expected return on plan assets, which was $115.2 million, $121.7 million and $117.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The expected return on plan assets was determined by multiplying the expected long term rate of return assumption by the market related value of plan assets. The market related value of plan assets recognizes asset gains and losses over five years to reduce the effects of short term market fluctuations on net periodic cost. For our pension plans we recorded: (i) for the year ended December 31, 2009, a total investment gain of $191.5 million which was comprised of a gain of $162.4 million in our U.S. Qualified Plan and a gain of $29.1 million in our non U.S. plans; (ii) for the year ended December 31, 2008, a total investment loss of $392.2 million which was comprised of a loss of $348.1 million in our U.S. Qualified Plan and a loss of $44.1 million in our non U.S. plans; and (iii) for the year ended December 31, 2007, a total investment gain of $105.7 million which was comprised of a gain of $91.2 million in our U.S. Qualified Plan and a gain of $14.5 million in our non U.S. plans. At January 1, 2010, the market related value of plan assets of our U.S. Qualified Plan and the non U.S. plans was $1,267.7 million and $180.2 million, respectively, compared with the fair value of its plan assets of $1,045.0 million and $169.2 million, respectively. Changes in the funded status of our pension plans could result in fluctuation in our shareholders equity (deficit). We are required to recognize the funded status of our benefit plans as a liability or an asset, on a plan by plan basis with an offsetting adjustment to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), in our shareholders equity (deficit), net of tax. Accordingly, the amounts recognized in equity represent unrecognized gains/losses and prior service costs. These unrecognized gains/losses and prior service costs will be amortized out of equity (deficit) based on an actuarial calculation each period. Gains/losses and prior service costs that arise during the year are recognized as a component of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) which is then reflected in AOCI. We recorded a net loss of $10.4 million and net loss of $291.1 million in OCI, net of applicable tax, in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to the actuarial gain/loss and prior service cost arising during the period and the amortization of such items. The decreased loss in 2009 was primarily due to the improvement of the funded status for our U.S. Qualified Plan from a deficit of $155.5 million at December 31, 2008 compared to a deficit of $121.5 million at December 31, 2009, driven by better asset performance in 2009 compared to a significant asset loss in 2008. The positive impact from better asset performance was partially mitigated by a lower discount rate at December 31, 2009. For information on pension and postretirement benefit plan contribution requirements, please see Future Liquidity Sources and Uses of Funds Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefit Plan Contribution Requirements. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for more information regarding costs of, and assumptions for, our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs. Contingencies and Litigation We establish reserves in connection with legal proceedings, claims and litigation when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time. Estimating probable losses requires analyses of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments concerning potential actions by third parties and regulators. In connection with tax proceedings, we 31 Table of Contents utilize a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This is an inherently subjective and complex process, and actual results may differ from our estimates by material amounts. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when the following four conditions are met: Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; The contract fee is fixed and determinable; Delivery or performance has occurred; and Collectibility is reasonably assured. If at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment. If there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. If at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our Risk Management Solutions are generally sold under fixed price subscription contracts that allow customers unlimited access to risk information. Revenue on this type of contract is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is generally one year. Risk information is also sold using monthly or annual contracts that allow customers to purchase our risk information up to the contract amount based on an agreed price list. Once the contract amount is fully used, additional risk information can be purchased at per item prices which may be different than those in the original contract. Revenue on these contracts is recognized on a per item basis as information is purchased and delivered to the customer. If customers do not use the full amount of their contract and forfeit the unused portion, we recognize the forfeited amount as revenue at contract expiration. Where a data file of risk information is sold with periodic updates to that information, a portion of the revenue related to the updates is deferred as a liability on the balance sheet and recognized as the updates are delivered, usually on a quarterly or monthly basis over the term of the contract. Revenue related to services, such as monitoring, is recognized ratably over the period of performance. Sales & Marketing Solutions that provide continuous access to our marketing information and business reference databases may include access or hosting fees which are sold on a subscription basis. Revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically one year. Where a data file of marketing information is sold, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the marketing data file to the customer. If the contract provides for periodic updates to that marketing data file, the portion of the revenue related to updates is deferred as a liability on the balance sheet and recognized as the updates are delivered, usually on a quarterly or monthly basis, over the term of the contract. Internet Solutions represent the results of our Hoovers business, including both the First Research division and the AllBusiness.com division. Hoovers and First Research provide subscription solutions that allow continuous access to our business information databases. Revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is generally one year. Any additional solutions purchased are recognized upon delivery to the customer. AllBusiness.com provides online media and e commerce products that provide advertisers the ability to target small business customers. Revenue is recognized as solutions are delivered to the customer over the contract period. 32 Table of Contents Sales of software that are considered to be more than incidental are recognized in revenue when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed and the software has been shipped and installed, if required. Revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the services are performed. We have certain solution offerings that are sold as multi element arrangements. The multiple elements or deliverables may include access to our business information databases, information data files, updates, software and services. To account for each deliverable as a separate unit of accounting, they each must meet all of the following separation criteria: The delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a stand alone basis; There is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item(s); and If the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the undelivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company. If the deliverable or a group of deliverables meets the separation criteria, the total arrangement consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting based on its relative fair value. The amount of arrangement consideration that is allocated to a delivered unit of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another unit of accounting. We obtain vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of a deliverable by monitoring the price at which we sell the deliverable on a standalone basis. Where we are unable to use VSOE, we may use the price at which we or a third party sell a similar product to similarly situated customers on a standalone basis. If we do not have fair value for the delivered items, the contract fee is allocated to the undelivered items based on their fair values and the remaining residual amount, if any, is allocated to the delivered items. After the arrangement consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting, we apply the appropriate revenue recognition method from those described above for each unit of accounting, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. All deliverables that do not meet the separation criteria are combined with an undelivered unit of accounting. We generally recognize revenue for a combined unit of accounting based on the method most appropriate for the last delivered item. Deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales of our information solutions and generally relates to deferral of subscription revenue. Deferred revenue is included in current liabilities in the balance sheet and is subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies. We record revenue on a net basis for those sales where we act as an agent or broker in the transaction. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for disclosure of the impact that recently issued accounting standards may have on our audited consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements. They should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes set forth in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. 33 Table of Contents Consolidated Revenue The following table presents our revenue by segment: For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Revenue: North America $ 1,309.7 $ 1,364.2 $ 1,291.3 International 355.4 314.4 260.8 Core Revenue 1,665.1 1,678.6 1,552.1 Divested Business 21.9 47.7 47.1 Total Revenue $ 1,687.0 $ 1,726.3 $ 1,599.2 The following table presents our revenue by customer solution set: For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Revenue: Risk Management Solutions $ 1,071.8 $ 1,070.4 $ 991.4 Sales & Marketing Solutions 474.6 483.3 453.2 Internet Solutions 118.7 124.9 107.5 Core Revenue 1,665.1 1,678.6 1,552.1 Divested Business 21.9 47.7 47.1 Total Revenue $ 1,687.0 $ 1,726.3 $ 1,599.2 Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. Year ended December 31, 2008 Total revenue decreased $39.3 million, or 2% (1% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in total revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in total North America revenue of $54.5 million, or 4% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange) partially offset by an increase in total International revenue of $15.2 million, or 4% (14% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). Our divestiture of the domestic portion of our Italian operations in the second quarter of 2009 accounted for $21.9 million and $47.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Core revenue, which reflects total revenue less revenue from a divested business, decreased $13.5 million, or 1% (1% increase before the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in core revenue is primarily attributed to: Lower purchases from our customers due to a weak economy and budgetary pressures. We are working with our customers to reduce the scope of various projects to meet their budget constraints which has slightly improved our retention rates; and The negative impact of foreign exchange; partially offset by: Increased revenue as a result of a) our consolidation of our majority owned joint ventures in: i) Dun & Bradstreet Information Services India Private Limited (D&B India) completed in the fourth quarter of 2008; ii) HC International, Inc. in China completed in the fourth quarter of 2008; and iii) RoadWay International Limited (RoadWay) in China completed in the third quarter of 2009; b) our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Bisnodes UK operations and a 100% equity interest in Bisnodes 34 Table of Contents Irish operations (ICC) completed in the third quarter of 2009; and c) our acquisition of Quality Education Data (QED) completed in the first quarter of 2009, which in the aggregate, all of the previously mentioned contributed three points of the growth; Growth in each of our subscription plans from existing customers, including the customers who previously purchased value added solutions. These subscription plans provide our customers with unlimited use of our Risk Management reports and data; and Increased revenue from our Asia Pacific market, primarily from our majority owned Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture. Customer Solution Set On a customer solution set basis, the $13.5 million decrease in core revenue reflects: A $1.4 million, or less than 1% increase in Risk Management Solutions (2% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by an increase in International of $17.8 million, or 7% (18% increase before the effect of foreign exchange), partially offset by a decrease in North America of $16.4 million, or 2% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange); An $8.7 million, or 2% decrease (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), in Sales & Marketing Solutions. The decrease was driven by a decrease in North America of $32.8 million, or 8% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), partially offset by an increase in International of $24.1 million, or 37% (42% increase before the effect of foreign exchange); and A $6.2 million, or 5%, decrease in Internet Solutions (4% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange). The decrease was driven by a decrease in North America of $5.3 million, or 4% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange) and a decrease in International of $0.9 million, or 20% (3% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange). Year ended December 31, 2008 vs. Year ended December 31, 2007 Total revenue increased $127.1 million, or 8% (7% increase before the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in total revenue was primarily driven by an increase in total North America revenue of $72.9 million, or 6% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange) and an increase in total International revenue of $54.2 million, or 18% (14% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). Our divestiture of the domestic portion of our Italian operations in the second quarter of 2009 accounted for $47.7 million and $47.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Core revenue, which reflects total revenue less revenue from a divested business, increased $126.5 million, or 8% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in core revenue is primarily attributed to: Growth in our subscription plans, due to growth of customers renewing from a subscription plan as well as that associated with conversion from our legacy products to subscription plans from existing customers. These subscription plans provide our customers with unlimited use of our Risk Management reports and data; and Increased revenue as a result of our acquisitions and our majority owned Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture; partially offset by: Lower purchases of our legacy products. 35 Table of Contents Customer Solution Set On a customer solution set basis, the $126.5 million increase in core revenue reflects: A $79.0 million, or 8%, increase in Risk Management Solutions (7% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was driven by an increase in North America of $34.6 million, or 4% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), and an increase in International of $44.4 million, or 22% (19% increase before the effect of foreign exchange); A $30.1 million, or 7% increase (both before and after foreign exchange), in Sales & Marketing Solutions. The increase was driven by an increase in North America of $20.1 million, or 5% (both before and after foreign exchange), and an increase in International of $10.0 million, or 19% (17% increase before the effect of foreign exchange); and A $17.4 million, or 16% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), increase in Internet Solutions. The increase was driven by an increase in North America of $18.2 million, or 18% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), partially offset by a decrease in International of $0.8 million, or 15% (13% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange). Consolidated Operating Costs The following table presents our consolidated operating costs and operating income: For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Operating Expenses $ 500.3 $ 480.7 $ 430.4 Selling and Administrative Expenses 641.0 686.0 671.5 Depreciation and Amortization 58.1 58.5 46.6 Restructuring Charge 23.1 31.4 25.1 Operating Costs $ 1,222.5 $ 1,256.6 $ 1,173.6 Operating Income $ 464.5 $ 469.7 $ 425.6 As described above in the section Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations How We Manage Our Business, when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole, we focus on our operating income (and, therefore, operating costs) before non core gains and charges, because we do not view these items as reflecting our underlying business operations. We have identified under the caption Non Core Gains and (Charges) below, such non core gains and charges that are included in our GAAP results. Operating Expenses Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. Year ended December 31, 2008 Operating expenses increased by $19.6 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to the following: Increased data acquisition costs and fulfillment costs primarily associated with a) our consolidation of our majority owned joint ventures in: i) D&B India completed in the fourth quarter of 2008; ii) HC International, Inc. in China completed in the fourth quarter of 2009; and iii) RoadWay in China completed in the third quarter of 2009; b) our acquisition of ICC completed in the third quarter of 2009; and c) our majority owned Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture; and Increased costs associated with our strategic investments; 36 Table of Contents partially offset by: The positive impact of foreign exchange; and Lower costs as a result of our reengineering efforts and decreased variable expenses (e.g., professional fees and travel related expenses). Year ended December 31, 2008 vs. Year ended December 31, 2007 Operating expenses increased by $50.3 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to the following: Costs associated with investments in connection with our strategy, such as DNBi, our interactive, web based subscription service, and investments to improve customer satisfaction levels; Increased costs associated with our acquisitions and our majority owned Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture; The impact of foreign exchange; and Increased technology costs arising from obligations under our D&B Worldwide Network agreements; partially offset by: Lower costs as a result of our reengineering efforts. Selling and Administrative Expenses Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. Year ended December 31, 2008 Selling and administrative expenses decreased $45.0 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the following: Lower costs as a result of our reengineering efforts (e.g., our Go To Market approach for our North America sales organization) and decreased variable expenses (e.g., commissions and bonuses, professional fees, and travel related expenses); and The positive impact of foreign exchange; partially offset by: Increased selling expenses primarily associated with a) our consolidation of our majority owned joint ventures in: i) D&B India completed in the fourth quarter of 2008; ii) HC International, Inc. in China completed in the fourth quarter of 2008; and iii) RoadWay in China completed in the third quarter of 2009; b) our acquisition of ICC completed in the third quarter of 2009; c) our acquisition of QED completed in the first quarter 2009; and d) our majority owned Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture. Year ended December 31, 2008 vs. Year ended December 31, 2007 Selling and administrative expenses increased $14.5 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to the following: Increased selling expenses primarily related to investments to enhance our strategic capabilities, such as with our acquisitions and our majority owned Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture; and The impact of foreign exchange; partially offset by: Lower costs as a result of our reengineering efforts. 37 Table of Contents Matters Impacting Both Operating Expenses and Selling and Administrative Expenses Pension, Postretirement and 401(k) Plan For our pension plans globally, we had a net pension periodic cost of $6.0 million, net pension periodic income of $3.7 million and net pension periodic cost of $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The fluctuation in the pension cost/income was due to the following: The discount rates applied to the pension plans were major factors in driving the pension costs to fluctuate from year to year. The higher the discount rate, the lower the pension cost. The discount rate used to measure the pension costs for our U.S. plans for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was 6.10%, 6.37% and 5.84% , respectively. Actuarial loss amortization included in annual pension expense was also a major factor in driving the pension costs to fluctuate from year to year. Actuarial loss amortization was largely impacted by the discount rate and plan experience. The higher the discount rate, the lower the loss amortization. Actuarial loss amortization included in annual pension expense for all global plans was $22.5 million, $16.2 million and $23.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, of which $21.5 million, $14.1 million and $19.7 million were attributable to our U.S. plans for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Higher pension income in 2008 was primarily due to the higher discount rate applied to our U.S. plans and the major International plans, as well as lower actuarial loss amortization included in 2008. We expect that the net pension cost in 2010 will be approximately $6 million for all of our global pension plans. Lower discount rates and higher actuarial losses subject to amortization will increase our 2010 pension cost. The discount rates applied to our U.S. plans and major International plan at January 1, 2010, are 38 basis points and 102 basis points lower than 2009, respectively. This increase in 2010 pension cost is substantially offset by the impact of a longer amortization period applied to our U.S. Qualified Plan. Starting in November 2009, the amortization period applied to the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses for our U.S. Qualified Plan has been changed from average future service years of active participants to average life expectancy of all plan participants. The change was the result of almost all the plan participants being deemed inactive. We had postretirement benefit income of $1.3 million, $4.2 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Lower postretirement benefit income in 2009 was primarily due to full amortization of the prior service credit. This prior service credit was related to the 2003 plan amendment to limit our insurance premium contribution. Higher postretirement benefit income in 2008 was primarily due to higher amortization of actuarial gain, which was driven by positive plan experience and changes in assumptions. We expect postretirement benefit income will be approximately $3 million in 2010. The increase in income from 2009 to 2010 is primarily due to higher amortization of prior service credit, resulting from a plan amendment which will be effective March 1, 2010, that eliminates the company paid life insurance benefits for retirees. In addition, we will only share the minimum necessary amount of subsidy received from the government in any year to maintain actuarial equivalence for as long as possible. We had expense associated with our 401(k) Plan of $6.9 million, $19.2 million and $12.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in expense in 2009 was due to the amendment of our employer matching provision in the 401(k) Plan effective in February, 2009, to decrease our match formula from 100% to 50% of a team members contributions and to decrease the maximum match from seven percent (7%) to three percent (3%) of such team members eligible compensation, subject to certain 401(k) Plan limitations. The increase in expense in 2008 from 2007 was due to the amendment of our matching policy in the 401(k) Plan effective July 1, 2007, to increase our match formula from 50% to 100% of a team members contributions and to increase the maximum match to seven percent (7%) from six percent (6%), of such team members eligible compensation, subject to certain 401(k) Plan limitations. 38 Table of Contents Effective in April 2010, we will increase the employer maximum match from three percent (3%) to seven percent (7%) of a team members eligible compensation, subject to certain 401(k) Plan limitations and we will continue to match 50% of a team members contributions. We consider net pension cost and postretirement benefit income to be part of our compensation costs, and, therefore, they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses, based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs. See the discussion of Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations, above, and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Stock Based Compensation For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized total stock based compensation expense of $22.3 million, $27.6 million and $25.9 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized expense associated with our stock option programs of $9.5 million, $11.0 million and $11.9 million, respectively. The decreases for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, were primarily driven by a decrease in the overall number of employees eligible for stock options. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized expense associated with our restricted stock, restricted stock units and restricted stock opportunity programs of $11.9 million, $15.6 million and $13.1 million, respectively. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008, was primarily driven by performance based awards being below target, resulting in lower expense. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007, was primarily due to the addition of the 2008 annual grant and special grants awarded in the fourth quarter of 2007. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized expense associated with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) of $0.9 million, $1.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively. We consider these costs to be part of our compensation costs and, therefore, they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses, based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs. Depreciation and Amortization Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. Year ended December 31, 2008 Depreciation and amortization decreased $0.4 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily driven by a reassessment of the useful lives of our computer software in conjunction with changes in our technology strategy. We review the estimated remaining useful lives of our computer software and may extend the useful life when events and circumstances indicate the computer software can operate beyond its original or current useful life. Prior to the second quarter of 2009, the useful life of computer software assets was typically three to five years. We now expect the useful life of our back end and back office software to be in the range of five to eight years, and we have extended the useful lives accordingly. This reassessment included a review of the major components of our strategy and consideration of the effects of obsolescence, technology, competition and other economic factors on the useful life of these assets. The impact of this change was effective in the second quarter of 2009, and the impact for the year ended December 31, 2009 was a reduction in software amortization expense by approximately $7 million after tax ($0.14 per diluted share). The decrease was partially offset by an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions and our majority owned joint ventures and increased capital costs for revenue generating investments to enhance our strategic capabilities. 39 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2008 vs. Year ended December 31, 2007 Depreciation and amortization increased $11.9 million, or 26%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily driven by the increased capital costs for revenue generating investments to enhance our strategic capabilities (e.g., DNBi) and the amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions and our majority owned joint ventures. Restructuring Charge Restructuring charges have been recorded in accordance with ASC 712 10, Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits, or ASC 712 10, and or ASC 420 10, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, or ASC 420 10, as appropriate. We record severance costs provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement once they are both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of ASC 712 10. We account for one time termination benefits, contract terminations, asset write offs, and or costs to terminate lease obligations less assumed sublease income in accordance with ASC 420 10, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with restructuring activities. Under ASC 420 10, we establish a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity, including severance and lease termination obligations, and other related costs, when the liability is incurred, rather than at the date that we commit to an exit plan. We reassess the expected cost to complete the exit or disposal activities at the end of each reporting period and adjust our remaining estimated liabilities, if necessary. The determination of when we accrue for severance costs and which standard applies depends on whether the termination benefits are provided under an ongoing arrangement as described in ASC 712 10 or under a one time benefit arrangement as defined by ASC 420 10. Inherent in the estimation of the costs related to the restructurings are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the exit activities. In determining the charges related to the restructurings, we had to make estimates related to the expenses associated with the restructurings. These estimates may vary significantly from actual costs depending, in part, upon factors that may be beyond our control. We will continue to review the status of our restructuring obligations on a quarterly basis and, if appropriate, record changes to these obligations in current operations based on managements most current estimates. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a $23.1 million restructuring charge in connection with Financial Flexibility initiatives. The significant components of these charges included: Severance and termination costs of $12.7 million in accordance with the provisions of ASC 712 10 were recorded. Approximately 535 employees are impacted. Of these 535 employees, approximately 365 employees have exited the Company and approximately 170 employees will exit the Company in 2010; and Lease termination obligations, other costs to consolidate or close facilities and other exit costs of $10.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a $31.4 million restructuring charge in connection with Financial Flexibility initiatives. The significant components of these charges included: Severance and termination costs of $27.5 million in accordance with the provisions of ASC 712 10 were recorded. Approximately 500 employees were impacted; and Severance and termination costs of $3.0 million in accordance with the provisions of ASC 420 10 were recorded. Approximately 40 employees were impacted. 40 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a $25.1 million restructuring charge in connection with Financial Flexibility initiatives. The significant components of these charges included: Severance and termination costs of $22.7 million in accordance with the provisions of ASC 420 10 were recorded. Approximately 315 employees were impacted; and Lease termination obligations, other costs to consolidate or close facilities and other exit costs of $2.4 million. Interest Income (Expense) Net The following table presents our Interest Income (Expense) Net: For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Interest Income $ 3.0 $ 11.5 $ 7.3 Interest Expense (45.7 ) (47.4 ) (28.3 ) Interest Income (Expense) Net $ (42.7 ) $ (35.9 ) $ (21.0 ) Interest income decreased $8.5 million, or 74%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008, primarily attributable to lower interest rates, as well as lower amounts of invested cash. Interest income increased $4.2 million, or 57%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007, primarily due to higher interest bearing investments partially offset by lower interest rates. Interest expense decreased by $1.7 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008, primarily attributable to lower interest rates partially offset by higher amounts of average debt outstanding. Interest expense increased by $19.1 million, or 68%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007, primarily attributable to higher amounts of debt outstanding, partially offset by lower interest rates.

See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. (c) During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized the reduction of a contractual receipt under the Tax Allocation Agreement between Moodys Corporation and D&B as it relates to the expiration of the statute of limitations. (d) During the year ended December 31, 2008, we entered into an agreement with HC International Inc. and established two joint venture companies including Beijing D&B HuiCong Market Research Co., Ltd. and Beijing HuiCong Market Research Co. Ltd., in which D&B has a 60% and 30% ownership interest, respectively. We recognized a gain of $0.6 million related to the minority owners share of the difference between the fair value of our contributed business and its carrying amount. (e) During the year ended December 31, 2007, we entered into an agreement with Huaxia International Credit Consulting Co.

(h) Miscellaneous Other Income (Expense) Net decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange. Miscellaneous Other Income (Expense) Net increased for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to the positive impact of foreign exchange. Provision for Income Taxes Effective Tax Rate for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 31.9 % Impact of Tax Reserves for Uncertain Tax Positions 3.2 % Impact of Tax Incurred in Connection with Huaxia/D&B China Joint Venture and Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture (2.5 )% Impact of Liquidation of Dormant International Entities (3.2 )% Other (0.2 )% Effective Tax Rate for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 29.2 % Impact of Benefits Derived From Worldwide Legal Entity Simplification (7.0 )% Impact of Settlement of Global Tax Audits 3.2 % Other 0.5 % Effective Tax Rate for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 25.9 % Discontinued Operations On December 27, 2007, we sold our Italian real estate business for $9.0 million, which was a part of our International segment, and we have reclassified the historical financial results of the Italian real estate business as discontinued operations. We have reflected the results of this business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented as set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We have recorded the resulting gain of $0.4 million (both pre tax and after tax) from the sale in the first quarter of 2008 in the consolidated statement of operations. 42 Table of Contents Earnings Per Share Effective January 1, 2009, we updated our policy to reflect the authoritative guidance in ASC 260 10, which clarifies that instruments granted in share based payment transactions (e.g., stock based awards) are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing Earnings Per Share (EPS) under the two class method. The two class method requires earnings to be allocated between common shareholders and holders of participating securities. All outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends are considered to be a separate class of common stock and should be included in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS. The EPS calculation is applied retrospectively to all prior period EPS data presented. The impact of the adoption resulted in a four cent and two cent decrease to our basic and diluted EPS for each of the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Based on a review of our stock based awards, we have determined that only our restricted stock awards are deemed participating securities. The weighted average restricted shares outstanding was 0.4 million shares for each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The following table sets forth our EPS: For Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Basic Earnings Per Share of Common Stock: Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to D&B Common Shareholders $ 6.06 $ 5.65 $ 4.99 Income from Discontinued Operations Attributable to D&B Common Shareholders 0.02 0.09 Net Income Attributable to D&B Common Shareholders $ 6.06 $ 5.67 $ 5.08 Diluted Earnings Per Share of Common Stock: Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to D&B Common Shareholders $ 5.99 $ 5.56 $ 4.88 Income from Discontinued Operations Attributable to D&B Common Shareholders 0.02 0.09 Net Income Attributable to D&B Common Shareholders $ 5.99 $ 5.58 $ 4.97 For the year ended December 31, 2009, basic EPS attributable to D&B common shareholders increased 7% compared with the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to a 3% increase in net income due to a lower effective tax rate, the benefit derived from the divestiture of the domestic portion of our Italian operations and a 4% reduction in the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding resulting from our total share repurchases. For the year ended December 31, 2009, diluted EPS attributable to D&B common shareholders increased 7% compared with the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to a 3% increase in net income due to a lower effective tax rate, the benefit derived from the divestiture of the domestic portion of our Italian operations and a 4% reduction in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding resulting from our total share repurchases. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $150.0 million under our Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs. In addition, we repurchased 1.0 million shares of common stock for $75.6 million under our Board of Directors approved share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. For the year ended December 31, 2008, basic EPS attributable to D&B common shareholders increased 12% compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to a 4% increase in net income due to increased operating performance, the favorable resolution of global tax audits including the liquidation of dormant International corporations and or divested entities, settlement of a legacy tax matter arbitration, the release of 43 Table of Contents reserves in 2008 for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and a 7% reduction in the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding resulting from our total share repurchases. For the year ended December 31, 2008, diluted EPS attributable to D&B common shareholders increased 12% compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to a 4% increase in net income due to increased operating performance, the favorable resolution of global tax audits including the liquidation of dormant International corporations and or divested entities, settlement of a legacy tax matter arbitration, the release of reserves in 2008 for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and a 7% reduction in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding resulting from our total share repurchases.

Therefore, on January 1, 2009, we began managing our operations through the following two segments: North America (which consists of the U.S. and Canada) and International (which consists of our operations in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America). We have conformed historical amounts to reflect the new segment structure. Our results are reported under the following two segments: North America and International. The segments reported below are our segments for which separate financial information is available and upon which operating results are evaluated on a timely basis to assess performance and to allocate resources. North America North America is our largest segment representing 78%, 79% and 81% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and 79%, 81% and 83% of our core revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. There were no divestitures within this segment during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The following table presents our North America total and core revenue by customer solution set and North America operating income for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Revenue: Risk Management Solutions $ 808.9 $ 825.3 $ 790.7 Sales & Marketing Solutions 385.5 418.3 398.2 Internet Solutions 115.3 120.6 102.4 North America Total and Core Revenue $ 1,309.7 $ 1,364.2 $ 1,291.3 Operating Income $ 482.5 $ 513.3 $ 480.8 Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. Year ended December 31, 2008 North America Overview North America total and core revenue decreased $54.5 million, or 4% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. North America Customer Solution Sets On a customer solution set basis, the $54.5 million decrease in core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, reflects: Risk Management Solutions A decrease in Risk Management Solutions of $16.4 million, or 2% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). 46 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2009, Traditional Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 72% of total North America Risk Management Solutions, decreased 3% (2% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange). The decrease was primarily due to: Lower purchases of our traditional legacy products due to economic and budgetary pressures; partially offset by: Higher purchases due to a conversion from our legacy products to subscription plans from existing customers including the customers who previously purchased value added solutions. These subscription plans provide our customers with unlimited use of our Risk Management reports and data. We continue to see high single digit price lifts when existing customers renew and double digit price lifts when customers convert to DNBi. Also, with more than half of our Risk Management Solutions revenue already on DNBi, we have a smaller base available for conversion. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Value Added Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 21% of total North America Risk Management Solutions, decreased 3% (2% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange). The decrease was primarily due to: Lower purchases of our legacy VAPs products from our customers due to economic and budgetary pressures; partially offset by: Higher purchases from existing customers of new modules enabled by our DNBi platform. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Supply Management Solutions, which accounted for 7% of total North America Risk Management Solutions, increased 9% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), on a small base. Sales & Marketing Solutions A decrease in Sales & Marketing Solutions of $32.8 million, or 8% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). For the year ended December 31, 2009, Traditional Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 37% of total North America Sales & Marketing Solutions, decreased 12% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The decrease was primarily due to: Lower purchases of our legacy products from our customers due to a weak economy and budgetary pressures. This is largely driven by a secular trend, as customers shift from direct mail activities to digital marketing to reduce costs; A shift in timing of early renewals (primarily into 2008); partially offset by: Increased revenue associated with our acquisition of QED completed in the first quarter of 2009, which contributed five points of the growth. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Value Added Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 63% of total North America Sales & Marketing Solutions, decreased 5% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The decrease was primarily due to: Lower purchases of our legacy products from our customers due to economic pressures. We continue to have consistent customer retention but the dollar spend per customer has declined; and A shift in timing of early renewals (primarily into 2008); 47 Table of Contents partially offset by: Higher purchases from certain of our customers due to our providing more value through bundled offerings. Internet Solutions A decrease in Internet Solutions of $5.3 million, or 4% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), as a result of a decline in renewal sales of our subscription plans triggered by a reduction in the budgets of our customers and a decline in advertising revenue partially offset by a benefit from one large customer deal. The lower demand in 2009 will impact our 2010 financial results, and, as such, revenue will remain weak through the first half of the year. We expect a gradual recovery as 2010 unfolds. For 2010, we expect revenue in North America to be slightly better than 2009. We expect the first quarter revenue decline for North America to be similar to our fourth quarter 2009 and then show a gradual improvement in trends over the course of the year as a result of: 1) Improving upfront customer commitment trends; 2) Greater new customer acquisition due to our new Go To Market strategy; and 3) The benefit of our product investments we made in 2009. We expect our Risk Management Solutions revenue results in the first half of 2010 to continue to feel the impact of lower 2009 up front demand for our subscription products. Specifically, we expect the Risk Management Solutions rate of decline to get slightly worse in the first quarter of 2010 than it was in the fourth quarter of 2009, before gradually improving over the rest of 2010 as our new customer initiatives gain traction. In addition, since our Internet Solutions business is primarily a subscription business, the results reflect our weak up front demand in sales earlier in 2009. As a result, we expect these trends to continue to be weak in the first half of 2010, before stabilizing in the second half of 2010. North America Operating Income North America operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $482.5 million, compared to $513.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $30.8 million, or 6%. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to: A decrease in North America revenue; Increased costs associated with our strategic investments; and An increase in expenses primarily associated with the acquisition of QED; partially offset by: Lower costs as a result of our reengineering efforts and decreased variable expenses (e.g., commissions, bonuses and travel related expenses). Year ended December 31, 2008 vs. Year ended December 31, 2007 North America Overview North America total and core revenue increased $72.9 million, or 6% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase reflects growth in all of our customer solution sets. 48 Table of Contents North America Customer Solution Sets On a customer solution set basis, the $72.9 million increase in total and core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, reflects: Risk Management Solutions An increase in Risk Management Solutions of $34.6 million, or 4% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). For the year ended December 31, 2008, Traditional Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 73% of total North America Risk Management Solutions, increased 4% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The primary drivers of this growth were: Growth in our subscription plans, due to growth of customers renewing from a subscription plan as well as our existing customers converting from our legacy products to subscription plans. These subscription plans provide our customers with unlimited use of our Risk Management reports and data; partially offset by: Lower purchases of our legacy products by our small customers. For the year ended December 31, 2008, Value Added Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 21% of total North America Risk Management Solutions, increased 2% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The primary drivers of this growth were: Higher purchases from existing customers of new modules enabled by our DNBi platform; partially offset by: A shift in product mix to our Preferred Pricing Agreement with DNBi subscription plans (as noted above). For the year ended December 31, 2008, Supply Management Solutions, which accounted for 6% of total North America Risk Management Solutions, increased 11% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), on a small base.

The increase was primarily due to: Increased purchases from existing customers; and Increased revenue associated with our acquisition of Purisma completed in the fourth quarter of 2007; partially offset by: A slow down in purchases in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the weakening economy, pressure on customer budgets and our execution in the marketplace. Internet Solutions An increase in Internet Solutions of $18.2 million, or 18% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was due to continued growth in subscription revenue in prior quarters and the AllBusiness.com acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2007. North America Operating Income North America operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $513.3 million, compared to $480.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $32.5 million, or 7%. The increase in operating income was primarily attributed to: An increase in North America revenue; partially offset by: Increased costs associated with our acquisitions; and Increased costs associated with investments to enhance our strategic capabilities. International International represented 22%, 21% and 19% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. On May 29, 2009, we completed the sale of substantially all the assets and liabilities of the domestic portion of our Italian operations. This sale has been classified as a Divestiture. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further detail.

Operating Income International operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $70.9 million, compared to $54.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $16.7 million, or 31%, primarily due to: An increase in core revenue; Lower costs as a result of our reengineering efforts; and The impact of foreign exchange; partially offset by: Increased data acquisition costs and costs associated with our Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture; Investment in data purchases, new products, product enhancements and fulfillment services; and Higher variable selling expenses related to increased revenue (e.g., commissions, bonus, etc.). Market Risk We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of certain of our investments. We employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies. We use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge short term foreign currency denominated loans, investments and certain third party and intercompany transactions. From time to time, we use foreign exchange option contracts to reduce our International earnings exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. In addition, from time to time, we use interest rate derivatives to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure on our outstanding debt or in anticipation of future debt issuance, as discussed under Interest Rate Risk Management below. A discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Interest Rate Risk Management In January 2009 and December 2008, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with aggregate notional amounts of $25 million and $75 million, respectively, and designated these swaps as cash flow hedges against variability in cash flows related to our bank revolving credit facility. These transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value of the hedges are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). At December 31, 2009, the balance of net derivative losses associated with these swaps included in AOCI was approximately $0.8 million. 55 Table of Contents In January 2008, we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with an aggregate notional amount of $400 million. The objective of these hedges was to mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in Treasury rates in the anticipation of the April 2008 debt issuance. These transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of debt issuance were recorded in AOCI. In connection with the issuance of the senior notes in April 2008 with a face value of $400 million that mature on April 1, 2013, bearing interest at an annual rate of 6.00%, payable semi annually (the 2013 notes), these interest rate derivative transactions were executed, resulting in a payment of $8.5 million at the date of termination. The payments are recorded in AOCI, and will be amortized over the life of the 2013 notes. In February 2006 and September 2005, we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of $100 million and $200 million, respectively. The objective of these hedges was to mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in Treasury rates in the anticipation of the below referenced debt issuance. These transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges, and as such, changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of debt issuance were recorded in AOCI. In connection with the issuance of the senior notes (the 2011 notes), these interest rate derivative transactions were executed, resulting in proceeds of approximately $5.0 million at the date of termination. The proceeds are recorded in AOCI and will be amortized over the life of the 2011 notes. At December 31, 2006, we had a $300 million bank revolving credit facility available at prevailing short term interest rates, which we terminated on April 19, 2007, and then entered into a new $500 million, five year bank revolving credit facility, which expires in April 2012. On January 25, 2008, we exercised a $150 million expansion feature on our $500 million credit facility expanding the total facility to $650 million. Borrowings under the $650 million credit facility are available at prevailing short term interest rates. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had $259.4 million and $203.4 million of floating rate debt outstanding under the facility, respectively. A 100 basis point increase/decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding variable rate debt at December 31, 2009, would result in an incremental increase/decrease in annual interest expense of approximately $2 million. Foreign Exchange Risk Management We have numerous offices in various countries outside North America and conduct operations in various countries through minority equity investments and strategic relationships with local providers. Our International operations generated approximately 22% and 21% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Approximately 38% and 34% of our assets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were located outside of North America. Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings, cash flows and financial position of our International operations. We follow a policy of hedging balance sheet positions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries. In addition, we are subject to foreign exchange risk associated with our International earnings and investments. We use short term, foreign exchange forward and option contracts to implement our hedging strategies. Typically, these contracts have maturities of twelve months or less. These contracts are denominated primarily in the British pound sterling, the Euro and Canadian dollar. The gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with the balance sheet positions hedge are recorded in Other Income (Expense) Net in our consolidated financial statements and are essentially offset by the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency transactions. 56 Table of Contents As in prior years, we have hedged substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries with short term forward foreign exchange contracts. In addition, from time to time, we use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain foreign earnings and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain net investment positions. The underlying transactions and the corresponding forward exchange and option contracts are marked to market at the end of each quarter and are reflected within our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we did not have any option contracts outstanding. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had a notional amount of approximately $271.0 million and $254.5 million, respectively, of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding that offset foreign currency denominated loans. Realized gains and losses associated with these contracts were $24.9 million and $13.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009; $16.2 million and $41.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008; and $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Unrealized gains and losses associated with these contracts were $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009; $0.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008; and $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007. If exchange rates were to increase on average 10% from year end levels, without the benefit of having hedging activities, the unrealized loss would be approximately $10 million. If exchange rates on average were to decrease 10% from year end levels, without the benefit of having hedging activities, the unrealized gain would be approximately $8 million. However, the estimated potential gain and loss on these contracts is expected to be substantially offset by changes in the dollar value of the underlying transactions. Liquidity and Financial Position In connection with our focus on delivering Total Shareholder Return, we will remain disciplined in the use of our shareholders cash, maintaining three key priorities for the use of this cash: First, making ongoing investments in the business to drive growth; Second, investing in acquisitions that we believe will be value accretive to enhance our capabilities and accelerate our growth; and Third, continuing to return cash to shareholders. We believe that cash provided by operating activities, supplemented as needed with available financing arrangements, is sufficient to meet our short term needs (twelve months or less), including restructuring charges, transition costs, contractual obligations and contingencies (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K), excluding the legal matters identified in such note for which exposures cannot be estimated or are not probable. In addition, we believe that our ability to readily access the bank and capital markets for incremental financing needs will enable us to meet our continued focus on Total Shareholder Return. We have the ability to access the short term borrowings market from time to time to fund working capital needs, acquisitions and share repurchases. Such borrowings would be supported by our credit facility, when needed. The unprecedented disruption in the economic environment has had a significant adverse impact on a number of commercial and financial institutions. At this point in time our liquidity has not been impacted by the credit environment and management does not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. Management continues to closely monitor our liquidity, the credit markets and our financial counterparties. However, management cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment. The following discussions are on a continuing operations basis and therefore exclude the results of the Italian real estate business. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 57 Table of Contents Cash Provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations Net cash provided by operating activities was $369.5 million, $433.9 million and $384.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. Year ended December 31, 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $64.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by: Timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities (e.g., investments, data purchases, etc.); An increase in net tax payments; An increase in restructuring payments associated with our Financial Flexibility initiatives; and Lower collections; partially offset by: Increased net income of our underlying business excluding the impact of non cash gains and losses. Year ended December 31, 2008 vs. Year ended December 31, 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $49.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily driven by: Increased net income of our underlying business excluding the impact of non cash gains and losses; A decrease in restructuring payments associated with our Financial Flexibility initiatives; and Increased collections; partially offset by: An increase in both tax payments and interest expense payments. Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities from Continuing Operations Net cash used in investing activities was $120.7 million, $154.5 million and $216.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. Year ended December 31, 2008 Net cash used in investing activities was $120.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $154.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The $33.8 million decrease primarily reflects the following activities: Cash settlements of our foreign currency contracts for our hedged transactions resulted in cash inflows of $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to cash outflows of $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008; partially offset by: A net increase in additions to computer software and other intangibles and capital expenditures, which was primarily used to fund software development, product and platform enhancements across all three of our solution sets. Capital expenditures were approximately 4% of revenue in 2009 and we expect them to be approximately 5% of revenue in 2010; and 58 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2009, in connection with our initiatives to drive long term growth, we spent $74.6 million on acquisitions/majority owned joint ventures and other investments, net of cash acquired, as compared to $69.2 million, net of cash acquired, during the year ended December 31, 2008. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information. Year ended December 31, 2008 vs. Year ended December 31, 2007 Net cash used in investing activities was $154.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $216.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $61.9 million decrease primarily reflects the following activities: During the year ended December 31, 2008, in connection with our initiatives to drive long term growth, we spent $69.2 million on acquisitions/majority owned joint ventures and other investments, net of cash acquired, as compared to $146.5 million, net of cash acquired, during the year ended December 31, 2007. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information; A decrease in capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles, which was primarily used to fund software development, product and platform enhancements across all three of our solution sets. The decrease of $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007 was primarily driven by a longer software product development cycle in 2008 versus 2007. The decrease in capital expenditures is related to approximately $6.1 million of furniture and equipment primarily related to our Center Valley, Pennsylvania facility, which was included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006, and was paid for in the year ended December 31, 2007; and During the year ended December 31, 2008, we received approximately $9.0 million in cash from the sale of our Italian real estate business on December 27, 2007; partially offset by: Cash settlements of our foreign currency contracts for our hedged transactions resulted in cash outflows of $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to cash outflows of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Cash Used in Financing Activities from Continuing Operations Net cash used in financing activities was $213.1 million, $242.5 million and $143.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As set forth below for all these years, these changes primarily relate to contractual obligations, share repurchases and dividends. Contractual Obligations Debt In April 2008, we issued notes with a face value of $400 million that mature on April 1, 2013, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.00%, payable semi annually. The proceeds from this issuance were used to repay indebtedness under our credit facility. On January 30, 2008, we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with an aggregate notional amount of $400 million. The objective of these hedges was to mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in Treasury rates in anticipation of the issuance of the 2013 notes. These transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of the issuance of the 2013 notes were recorded in AOCI. In connection with the issuance of the 2013 notes, these interest rate derivative transactions were executed, resulting in a payment of $8.5 million at the date of termination. The payments are recorded in AOCI, and are being amortized over the life of the 2013 notes. 59 Table of Contents Credit Facility At December 31, 2007, we had a $500 million, five year bank revolving credit facility, which expires in April 2012. Borrowings under the $500 million credit facility are available at prevailing short term interest rates. On January 25, 2008, we exercised a $150 million expansion feature on our $500 million credit facility expanding the total facility to $650 million. We had $259.4 million and $203.4 million of borrowings outstanding under the $650 million credit facility at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2007, we had $425.3 million of borrowings outstanding under the $500 million credit facility. We borrowed under these facilities from time to time during the year ended December 31, 2009 to fund our share repurchases, acquisition strategy and working capital needs. Share Repurchases During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of common stock for $225.6 million under our share repurchase programs. The share repurchases are comprised of the following programs: In February 2009, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million share repurchase program which commenced in December 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased 0.2 million shares of common stock for $22.7 million under this share repurchase program. We anticipate that this program will be completed by December 2011. In December 2007, our Board of Directors approved a $400 million, two year share repurchase program which commenced in February 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock for $127.3 million under this share repurchase program. This program was completed in December 2009; and In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a four year, five million share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of the shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. We repurchased 1.0 million shares of common stock for $75.6 million under this program during the year ended December 31, 2009. This program expires in August 2010. We anticipate that this program will be completed prior to maturity in August 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased 4.4 million shares of common stock for $381.9 million under our share repurchase programs. The share repurchases are comprised of the following programs: In December 2007, our Board of Directors approved a $400 million, two year share repurchase program, which commenced in February 2008. We repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for $272.7 million under this share repurchase program during the year ended December 31, 2008; In May 2007, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million, one year share repurchase program, which commenced in July 2007. We repurchased 0.3 million shares of common stock for $26.8 million under this repurchase program during the year ended December 31, 2008. This program was completed in February 2008; and In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a four year, five million share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of the shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. We repurchased 0.9 million shares of common stock for $82.4 million under this program during the year ended December 31, 2008. This program expires in August 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased 4.5 million shares of common stock for $408.5 million under our share repurchase programs. The share repurchases are comprised of the following programs: In May 2007, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million, one year share repurchase program, which began in July 2007 upon the completion of the then existing $200 million program. We purchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $173.2 million under the new $200 million program during the year ended December 31, 2007. This program was completed in February 2008; 60 Table of Contents In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million, one year share repurchase program which began in October 2006. We repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $125.0 million under this program during the year ended December 31, 2007. This program was completed in July 2007; and In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a four year, five million share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of the shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. We repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock for $110.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. This program expires in August 2010. Dividends The total amount of dividends paid during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $71.5 million, $65.6 million and $58.4 million, respectively. Future Liquidity Sources and Uses of Funds Contractual Cash Obligations The following table quantifies, as of December 31, 2009, our contractual obligations that will require the use of cash in the future. Contractual Obligations(a) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter All Other (Amounts in millions) Long Term Debt(1) $ 1,064.2 $ 43.5 $ 329.3 $ 284.6 $ 406.2 $ 0.1 $ 0.5 $ Operating Leases(2) $ 128.2 $ 30.6 $ 24.3 $ 20.1 $ 14.2 $ 12.7 $ 26.3 $ Obligations to Outsourcers(3) $ 373.1 $ 121.7 $ 93.0 $ 67.3 $ 51.3 $ 39.8 $ $ Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Payments/Contributions(4) $ 891.5 $ 38.4 $ 45.9 $ 34.2 $ 33.2 $ 32.3 $ 707.5 $ Spin off Obligation(5) $ 21.5 $ 21.5 $ $ $ $ $ $ Unrecognized Tax Benefits(6) $ 129.0 $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 129.0 (a) Because their future cash flows are uncertain, noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the table. (1) Primarily represents our senior notes with a face value of $300 million that mature in March 2011, net of a $0.2 million discount, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 5.50%, payable semi annually, borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facility at short term interest rates and our senior notes with a face value of $400 million that mature in April 2013, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.00%, payable semi annually. Amounts include the interest portion on future obligations. The interest rate on our senior notes is presented using the stated interest rate. Interest expense on our bank credit facility is estimated using the rate in effect as of December 31, 2009. (2) Most of our operations are conducted from leased facilities, which are under operating leases that expire over the next ten years, with the majority expiring within five years. We also lease certain computer and other equipment under operating leases that expire over the next three and five years, respectively. These computer and other equipment leases are frequently renegotiated or otherwise changed as advancements in computer technology produce opportunities to lower costs and improve performance. (3) In July 2002, we outsourced certain technology functions to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) under a 10 year agreement, which we had the right to terminate for a fee at any time and under certain other conditions. Under the terms of the agreement, CSCs responsibilities included data center operations, technology help desk and network management functions in the U.S. and UK as well as certain application development and maintenance functions. This agreement was amended in March 2008, which, among other things, increased certain services level agreements that CSC is required to provide under the Technology Services Agreement and added additional security services to be performed by CSC. In August 2009, we 61 Table of Contents entered into a wind down agreement with CSC and Acxiom Corporation (Acxiom) which terminated all of the data center operations functions provided by CSC, effective September 2009. In September 2009 we entered into a new agreement with CSC for limited print and fulfillment services that remained with CSC. We incurred costs of $50.6 million, $77.6 million and $80.4 million under this contract for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In December 2003, we signed a three year agreement with ICT Group, Inc. (ICT), effective January 2004, to outsource certain marketing call center activities, which agreement contains two renewal options for up to a one year period. The agreement was amended effective September 2007 to be extended through 2011. Under the terms of the agreement, ICT is responsible for performing certain marketing and credit calling activities previously performed by our own call centers in North America. The obligation under the contract is based upon transmitted call volumes, but shall not be less than $3 million per contract year. We incurred costs of $3.3 million, $3.2 million and $4.5 million under this contract for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In October 2004, we signed a seven year outsourcing agreement with International Business Machines (IBM). Under the terms of the agreement, we have transitioned certain portions of our data acquisition and delivery and customer service to IBM. We may terminate this agreement for a fee at any time. We incurred costs of $26.2 million, $30.1 million and $30.7 million under this contract for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In July 2006, we signed a four year product and technology outsourcing agreement with Acxiom in order to significantly increase the speed, data processing capacity and matching capabilities we provide our global sales and marketing customers. In November 2008, we extended the term of the outsourcing agreement through 2011. In November 2008 we entered into an agreement that will expand our service capabilities, enhance customer experience and accelerate the migration of the remaining existing D&B fulfillment processes to Acxiom. In May 2009, and as part of our ongoing Financial Flexibility initiatives, we entered into another agreement with Acxiom to provide certain infrastructure management services that were formerly provided by CSC. These services include data center operations, technology help desk and network management functions. The agreement has an initial term ending in October 2014. In addition, after expiration of the initial term, we have the right to extend the agreement under the same terms for up to a maximum period of three years. Payments to Acxiom over the initial five year contract term based on current volumes will aggregate to approximately $285 million. The agreement provides for typical adjustments due to changes in volume, inflation and incremental project work. Payments made for the provision of such services in 2009 did not differ materially from payments that were expected to be made under our prior arrangement with CSC. However, we anticipate savings to be generated over the life of the contract. In addition, in December 2009 we signed a three year data maintenance and support agreement with Acxiom. Payments over the contract term will aggregate approximately $5 million. The agreement provides for typical adjustments due to changes in volume, inflation and incremental project work. We incurred costs of $42.5 million, $7.5 million and $6.6 million under all of these agreements for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Total payments to Acxiom over the remaining terms of the above contracts will aggregate to approximately $290 million. (4) Represents projected contributions to our non U.S. defined benefit plans as well as projected benefit payments related to our unfunded plans, including the U.S. Non Qualified Plans and our postretirement benefit plan. We do not expect to make any contributions to our U.S. Qualified Plan. The expected benefits are estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure our benefit obligation at the end of 2009 and include benefits attributable to estimated future employee service. A closed group approach is used in calculating the projected benefit payments, assuming only the participants who are currently in the valuation population are included in the projection and the projected benefits continue for up to approximately 99 years. 62 Table of Contents (5) As part of our spin off from Moodys/The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (D&B2) in 2000, Moodys/D&B2 and D&B entered into a Tax Allocation Agreement (TAA). Under the TAA, Moodys/D&B2 and D&B agreed that Moodys/D&B2 would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with the exercise of Moodys stock options (including Moodys stock options exercised by D&B employees) and D&B would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with the exercise of D&B stock options (including D&B stock options exercised by employees of Moodys/D&B2). Put simply, the tax deduction would go to the company that granted the stock options, rather than to the employer of the individual exercising the stock options. The TAA provides, however, that if the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues rules, regulations or other authority contrary to the agreed upon treatment of the compensation expense deductions under the TAA, then the party that becomes entitled under such guidance to take the deduction may be required to reimburse the other party for the tax benefit it has realized, in order to compensate the other party for its loss of such deduction. In 2002 and 2003, the IRS issued rulings that appear to provide that, under the circumstances applicable to Moodys/D&B2 and D&B, the compensation expense deduction belongs to the employer of the option grantee and not to the issuer of the option (e.g., D&B would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with D&B employees exercising Moodys/D&B2 options and Moodys/D&B2 would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with Moodys/D&B2 employees exercising D&B options). We have filed tax returns for 2001 through 2008, and made estimated tax deposits for 2009, consistent with the IRS rulings. Under the TAA, we may be required to reimburse Moodys/D&B2 for the loss of compensation expense deductions relating to tax years 2003 to 2009 of approximately $21.5 million in the aggregate for such years. In 2005 and 2006, we paid Moodys/D&B2 approximately $30.1 million in the aggregate under the TAA. We have not made any payments to Moodys/D&B2 since the first quarter of 2006. We may also be required to pay additional amounts in the future based upon interpretations by the parties of the TAA and the IRS rulings. (6) We have a total amount of unrecognized tax benefits of $136.9 million for the year ending December 31, 2009. Although we do not anticipate payments within the next twelve months for these matters, these could require the aggregate use of cash totaling approximately $129.0 million. As we cannot make reliable estimates regarding the timing of the cash flows by period, we have included unrecognized tax benefits within the All Other column in the table above. Capital Structure Every year we examine our capital structure and review our plans. During 2010, in connection with our focus on Total Shareholder Return (TSR), we anticipate continued share repurchases and cash dividends. We believe that cash provided by operating activities, supplemented as needed with readily available financing arrangements, is sufficient to meet our short term needs, including the cash cost of restructuring charges, transition costs, contractual obligations and contingencies, excluding the legal matters identified herein for which exposures cannot be estimated. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. As we execute our long term TSR strategy, which contemplates strategic acquisitions, we may require or consider additional financing to fund our TSR strategy. We regularly evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile and various financing alternatives for opportunities to enhance our capital structure. While we feel confident that such financing arrangements are available to us, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to access new sources of liquidity when required. The unprecedented disruption in the economic environment has had a significant adverse impact on a number of commercial and financial institutions. At this point in time, our liquidity has not been impacted by the credit environment and management does not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. Management continues to closely monitor our liquidity, the credit markets and our financial counterparties. However, management cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment. 63 Table of Contents Share Repurchases and Dividends In order to mitigate the dilutive effect of the shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP, our Board of Directors approved in August 2006, a four year, five million share repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased 1.0 million shares of common stock for $75.6 million under this program with 0.8 million shares remaining to be repurchased. We anticipate that this program will be completed prior to maturity in August 2010. In February 2009, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million share repurchase program which commenced in December 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased 0.2 million shares of common stock for $22.7 million under this share repurchase program with $177.3 million remaining under this program. We anticipate that this program will be completed by December 2011. On February 4, 2010, our Board of Directors approved the declaration of a dividend of $0.35 per share for the first quarter of 2010. This cash dividend will be payable on March 18, 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2010. Two Year Strategic Technology Investment Program On February 4, 2010, we announced an approximately two year strategic technology investment program aimed at strengthening our leading position in commercial data and improving our current technology platform to meet emerging needs of customers. We anticipate spending approximately $110 million to $130 million over approximately the next two years to complete the program, with approximately $45 million to $55 million of the spend occurring in 2010. Approximately 60% of the spend will be recognized as an increase to expenses and the remainder as capital expenditures. Potential Payments in Legal Matters We and our predecessors are involved in certain legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. These matters are at various stages of resolution, but could ultimately result in significant cash payments as described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We believe we have adequate reserves recorded in our consolidated financial statements for our share of current exposures in these matters, where applicable, as described therein. Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefit Plan Contribution Requirements For financial statement reporting purposes, the funded status of our pension plans, as determined in accordance with GAAP, had a deficit of $121.5 million, $257.0 million and $72.3 million for the U.S. Qualified Plan, the U.S. Non Qualified Plans and the non U.S. plans, respectively at December 31, 2009, as compared to deficits of $155.5 million, $235.8 million, and $45.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. The improvement in the funded status of the U.S. Qualified Plan was primarily due to better asset performance in 2009, partially offset by a higher projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2009 which was driven by a lower discount rate. The deterioration in the funded status of the U.S. Non Qualified Plans and the non U.S. plans was primarily due to a higher projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2009, mainly driven by lower discount rates and the negative impact from a change in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher asset gains in 2009. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. During fiscal 2009, we were not required to make contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan, the largest of our six plans, under funding regulations associated with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA 2006) as the plan was considered fully funded for the 2008 plan year. We do not expect to make any contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan in fiscal 2010 for the 2009 plan year. Final funding requirements for fiscal 2010 were determined based on our January 2010 funding actuarial valuation. 64 Table of Contents We expect to continue to make cash contributions to our other pension plans during 2010. The expected 2010 contribution is approximately $31 million, compared to $24.4 million in 2009. In addition, we expect to make benefit payments related to our postretirement benefit plan of approximately $7 million during 2010, compared to $8.4 million in 2009. See the Contractual Cash Obligations table above for projected contributions and benefit payments beyond 2009. Effective March 1, 2010, we will eliminate company paid life insurance benefits for retirees. In addition, we will only share the minimum necessary amount of subsidy received from the government in any year to maintain actuarial equivalence for as long as possible. Effective in April 2010, we will increase our employer maximum match from three percent (3%) to seven percent (7%) of a team members eligible compensation, subject to certain 401(k) Plan limitations and we will continue to match 50% of a team members contributions. We expect 2010 cash contributions to the 401(k) Plan to be approximately $9 million compared to $6.9 million in 2009. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for changes to our 401(k) Plan. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Related Party Transactions We do not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off balance sheet arrangements except for those disclosed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Additionally, we have not engaged in any significant related party transactions. Fair Value Measurements As described in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, effective January 1, 2008, we adopted the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements in ASC 820 10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which has been applied prospectively beginning January 1, 2008 for all financial assets and liabilities recognized in the consolidated financial statements at fair value. The authoritative guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and expands fair value measurement disclosures. The guidance also allowed for a one year delay of the effective date for fair value measurements for all non financial assets and liabilities, except for those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We delayed the effective date and applied the measurement provisions for all non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a non recurring basis until January 1, 2009. Our non recurring non financial assets and liabilities include long lived assets held and used, goodwill and intangible assets. These assets are recognized at fair value when they are deemed to be impaired. As of December 31, 2009, we did not have any unobservable (Level III) inputs in determining fair value for our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis other than our real estate funds. Forward Looking Statements We may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in reports to shareholders and in press releases and investor Web casts.
