Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations How We Manage Our Business For internal management purposes, we refer to core revenue, which we calculate as total operating revenue less the revenue of divested businesses. Core revenue is used to manage and evaluate the performance of our segments and to allocate resources because this measure provides an indication of the underlying changes in revenue in a single performance measure. Core revenue does not include reported revenue of divested businesses since they are not included in future revenue. On July 30, 2010, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our North American Self Awareness Solution business. This business has been classified as a Divested Business. This divested business contributed 2%, 5% and 6% of our North America total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 14 and Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further detail. On May 29, 2009, we completed the sale of substantially all the assets and liabilities of the domestic portion of our Italian operations. This business has been classified as a Divested Business. This divested business contributed 6% and 13% of our International total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 14 and Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further detail. We also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because we believe it is useful for investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another, both with and without the effects of foreign exchange. The change in our operating performance attributable to foreign currency rates is determined by converting both our prior and current periods by a constant rate. As a result, we monitor our core revenue growth both after and before the effects of foreign exchange. Core revenue growth excluding the effects of foreign exchange is referred to as core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange. From time to time we have analyzed and we may continue to further analyze core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange among two components, organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions. We analyze organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions because management believes this information provides an important insight into the underlying health of our business. Core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition. We evaluate the performance of our business segments based on segment revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange, and segment operating income growth before certain types of gains and charges that we consider do not reflect our underlying business performance. Specifically, for management reporting purposes, we evaluate business segment performance before non core gains and charges because such charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations. A recurring component of non core gains and charges are our restructuring charges, which result from a foundational element of our growth strategy that we refer to as Financial Flexibility. Through Financial Flexibility, management identifies opportunities to improve the performance of the business in terms of reallocating our spending from low growth or low value activities to activities that will create greater value for shareholders through enhanced revenue growth, improved profitability and or quality improvements. Management is committed through this process to examining our spending, and optimizing between variable and fixed costs to ensure flexibility in changes to our operating expense base as we make strategic choices. This enables us to continually and systematically identify improvement opportunities in terms of quality, cost and customer experience. Such charges are variable from period to period based upon actions identified and taken during each period. Management reviews operating results before such non core gains and charges on a monthly basis and establishes internal budgets and forecasts based upon such measures. Management further establishes annual and long term compensation such as salaries, target cash bonuses and target equity compensation amounts based on performance before non core gains and charges and a significant 25 percentage weight is placed upon performance before non core gains and charges in determining whether performance objectives have been achieved. Management believes that by eliminating non core gains and charges from such financial measures, and by being overt to shareholders about the results of our operations excluding such charges, business leaders are provided incentives to recommend and execute actions that are in the best long term interests of our shareholders, rather than being influenced by the potential impact a charge in a particular period could have on their compensation. Additionally, transition costs (period costs such as consulting fees, costs of temporary employees, relocation costs and stay bonuses incurred to implement the Financial Flexibility component of our strategy) are reported as Corporate and Other expenses and are not allocated to our business segments. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for financial information regarding our segments. Similarly, when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole, we focus on results (such as operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, net income, tax rate and diluted earnings per share) before non core gains and charges because such non core gains and charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations and may drive behavior that does not ultimately maximize shareholder value. It may be concluded from our presentation of non core gains and charges that the items that result in non core gains and charges may occur in the future. We monitor free cash flow as a measure of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles. Free cash flow measures our available cash flow for potential debt repayment, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividend payments and additions to cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. We believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating the funding available after supporting our ongoing business operations and our portfolio of product investments. Free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute measure for, or superior to, net cash flows provided by operating activities, investing activities or financing activities. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, we evaluate our North America Risk Management Solutions based on two metrics: (1) subscription, and non subscription, and (2) DNBi&reg; and non DNBi. We define subscription as contracts that allow customers unlimited use. In these instances, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract, which is generally one year and non subscription as all other revenue streams. We define DNBi as our interactive, customizable online application that offers our customers real time access to our most complete and up to date global DUNSRight information, comprehensive monitoring and portfolio analysis and non DNBi as all other revenue streams. Management believes these measures provide further insight into our performance and growth of our North America Risk Management Solutions revenue. The adjustments discussed herein to our results as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods, to allocate resources, to evaluate business performance and, as noted above, for compensation purposes. However, these financial measures (e.g., results before non core gains and charges and free cash flow) are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue, operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, net income, tax rate, diluted earnings per share, or net cash provided by operating activities, investing activities and financing activities prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, it should be noted that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly, or at all, the presentation of these financial measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies. See Results of Operations below for a discussion of our results reported on a GAAP basis. 26 Overview Through December 31, 2010, we managed and reported our business globally through two segments: North America (which consisted of our operations in the United States (U.S.) and Canada); and International (which consisted of our operations in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America). The financial statements of our subsidiaries outside of North America reflect a fiscal year ended November 30 to facilitate the timely reporting of our consolidated financial results and financial position. However, as a result of our recent acquisition of Dun & Bradstreet Australia Holdings Limited (D&B Australia), we began reporting our business as of January 1, 2011 through three segments: North America (which consists of our operations in the U.S. and Canada); Asia Pacific (which primarily consists of our operations in Australia, Japan and China); and Europe and other international markets (which primarily consists of our operations in the United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands, Belgium and Latin America). We will report financial results in this new segment structure beginning with the results for the first quarter of 2011 will and conform historical amounts to reflect the new segment structure. The following table presents the contribution by segment to total revenue and core revenue: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Total Revenue: North America 75 % 78 % 79 % International 25 % 22 % 21 % Core Revenue: North America 75 % 78 % 80 % International 25 % 22 % 20 % The following table presents the contribution by customer solution set to total revenue and core revenue: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Total Revenue by Customer Solution Set(1): Risk Management Solutions 62 % 60 % 57 % Sales & Marketing Solutions 29 % 28 % 28 % Internet Solutions 7 % 7 % 8 % Core Revenue by Customer Solution Set: Risk Management Solutions 63 % 63 % 62 % Sales & Marketing Solutions 30 % 30 % 30 % Internet Solutions 7 % 7 % 8 % (1) Our divested businesses contributed 2%, 5% and 7% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Of those policies, we consider the policies described below to be critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require managements subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If actual results in a given period ultimately differ from previous estimates, the actual results could have a material impact on such period. We have discussed the selection and application of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure regarding critical accounting policies and estimates as well as the other sections in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations Through June 30, 2007, we offered to substantially all of our U.S. based employees coverage under a defined benefit plan called The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation Retirement Account (U.S. Qualified Plan). The defined benefit plan covered active and retired employees including retired individuals from spin off companies (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further discussion of spin off companies). The benefits to be paid upon retirement are based on a percentage of the employees annual compensation. The percentage of compensation allocated annually to a retirement account ranged from 3% to 12.5% based on age and service. Amounts allocated under the plan also receive interest credits based on the 30 year Treasury rate or equivalent rate published by the Internal Revenue Service. Pension costs are determined actuarially and funded in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. During 2010 in conjunction with a determination letter review, we updated certain portions of the plans cash balance pay credit scale, along with the minimum interest crediting rate, retroactive to January 1, 1997, to ensure that the plan complies with the accrual rules in the Internal Revenue Code. We received a favorable determination letter for the plan in October 2010 in conjunction with these changes. We also maintain supplemental and excess plans in the United States (U.S. Non Qualified Plans) to provide additional retirement benefits to certain key employees of the Company. These plans are unfunded, pay as you go plans. The U.S. Qualified Plan and the U.S. Non Qualified Plans account for approximately 72% and 15% of our pension obligation, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Effective June 30, 2007, we amended the U.S. Qualified Plan and one of the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, known as the U.S. Pension Benefit Equalization Plan (the PBEP). Any pension benefit that had been accrued through such date under the two plans was frozen at its then current value and no additional benefits, other than interest on such amounts, will accrue 29 under the U.S. Qualified Plan and the PBEP. Our employees in certain of our international operations are also provided with retirement benefits through defined benefit plans, representing the remaining balance of our pension obligations. We also provide various health care for retirees. U.S. based employees, hired before January 1, 2004, who retire with 10 years of vesting service after age 45, are eligible to receive benefits. Postretirement benefit costs and obligations are determined actuarially. During the first quarter of 2010, we eliminated company paid life insurance benefits for retirees and modified our sharing of the Retiree Drug Subsidy with retirees that are projected to receive. Effective July 1, 2010, we elected to convert the current prescription drug program for retirees over 65 to a group based company sponsored Medicare Part D program, or Employer Group Waiver Plan (EGWP). Under this change, beginning in 2013, we will use the Part D subsidies delivered through the EGWP each year to reduce net company retiree medical costs until net company costs are completely eliminated. At that time, the Part D subsidies will be shared with retirees going forward to reduce retiree contributions. The key assumptions used in the measurement of the pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement cost are: Expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets which is based on a target asset allocation as well as expected returns on asset categories of plan investments; Discount rate which is used to measure the present value of pension plan obligations and postretirement health care obligations. The discount rates are derived using a yield curve approach which matches projected plan benefit payment streams with bond portfolios, reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans; Rates of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation/conversion rates which are based on an evaluation of internal plans and external market indicators; and Health care cost trends which are based on historical cost data, the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends. We believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, though changes in these assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The factor with the most immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements is a change in the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets for the U.S. Qualified Plan. For 2011, we will continue to use an expected long term rate of return of 8.25%. This assumption was 8.25% in each of the years 2010, 2009 and 2008. The 8.25% assumption represents our best estimate of the expected long term future investment performance of the U.S. Qualified Plan, after considering expectations for future capital market returns and the plans asset allocation. As of December 31, 2010 the U.S. Qualified Plan was 66% invested in publicly traded equity securities, 31% invested in debt securities and 3% invested in real estate investments. Every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the long term rate of return increases or reduces our annual operating income by approximately $3 million by increasing or reducing our net periodic pension income. Changes in the discount rate, rate of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation/conversion rates also have an effect on our annual operating income. Based on the factors noted above, the discount rate is adjusted at each remeasurement date while other assumptions are reviewed annually. For our U.S. plans, every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our pension cost by approximately $0.2 million. The discount rate used to determine pension cost for our U.S. pension plans was 5.72%, 6.10% and 6.37% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For 2011, we decreased the discount rate to 5.13% from 5.72% for all our U.S. pension plans. Differences between the assumptions stated above and actual experience could affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or 30 losses arise. These gains and losses are aggregated and amortized generally over the average future service periods or life expectancy of plan participants to the extent that such gains or losses exceed a corridor. The purpose of the corridor is to reduce the volatility caused by the difference between actual experience and the pension related assumptions noted above, on a plan by plan basis. For all of our pension plans, total actuarial losses that have not been recognized in our pension costs as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $902.7 million and $887.7 million, respectively, of which $703.8 million and $672.2 million, respectively, were attributable to the U.S. Qualified Plan, $105.2 million and $105.0 million, respectively, were attributable to the U.S. Non Qualified Plans, and the remainder was attributable to the non U.S. pension plans. See discussion in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We expect to recognize a portion of such losses in our 2011 net periodic pension cost of approximately $18 million, $7 million and $2 million, for the U.S. Qualified Plan, U.S. Non Qualified Plans and non U.S. plans, respectively, compared to $12.7 million, $6.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, in 2010. The higher amortization of actuarial loss in 2011 for the U.S. Qualified plan, which will be included in our pension cost in 2011, is primarily due to a lower discount rate and higher unrecognized actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 for the U.S. Qualified Plan related to the investment loss from 2008. Differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could affect our net periodic pension cost. For our pension plans, we recorded net pension periodic cost of $5.8 million, $6.0 million and net pension periodic income of $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. A major component of the net pension periodic cost is the expected return on plan assets, which was $113.4 million, $115.2 million and $121.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The expected return on plan assets was determined by multiplying the expected long term rate of return assumption by the market related value of plan assets. The market related value of plan assets recognizes asset gains and losses over five years to reduce the effects of short term market fluctuations on net periodic cost. For our pension plans we recorded: (i) for the year ended December 31, 2010, a total investment gain of $138.5 million which was comprised of a gain of $126.3 million in our U.S. Qualified Plan and a gain of $12.2 million in our non U.S. plans; (ii) for the year ended December 31, 2009, a total investment gain of $191.5 million which was comprised of a gain of $162.4 million in our U.S. Qualified Plan and a gain of $29.1 million in our non U.S. plans; and (iii) for the year ended December 31, 2008, a total investment loss of $392.2 million which was comprised of a loss of $348.1 million in our U.S. Qualified Plan and a loss of $44.1 million in our non U.S. plans. At January 1, 2011, the market related value of plan assets of our U.S. Qualified Plan and the non U.S. plans was $1,230.6 million and $186.2 million, respectively, compared with the fair value of its plan assets of $1,099.6 million and $178.5 million, respectively. Changes in the funded status of our pension plans could result in fluctuation in our shareholders equity (deficit). We are required to recognize the funded status of our benefit plans as a liability or an asset, on a plan by plan basis with an offsetting adjustment to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), in our shareholders equity (deficit), net of tax. Accordingly, the amounts recognized in equity represent unrecognized gains/losses and prior service costs. These unrecognized gains/losses and prior service costs are amortized out of equity (deficit) based on an actuarial calculation each period. Gains/losses and prior service costs that arise during the year are recognized as a component of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) which is then reflected in AOCI. As a result, we recorded a net income of $8.6 million and a net loss of $10.4 million in OCI, net of applicable tax, in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease of the loss in 2010 was primarily due to a tax adjustment recorded in 2010 associated with the enactment of Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act and an improvement in funded status at December 31, 2010, due to better plan experience and impact from assumption changes. Funded status for our global pension plans was a deficit of $431.2 million at December 31, 2010 compared to a deficit of $450.8 million at December 31, 2009, driven by better plan experience and positive impact from assumption changes in our International plan, partially offset by the deterioration of the funded status for our U.S. Qualified Plan due to less favorable actuarial experience in 2010. The funded status for our U.S. Qualified Plan was a deficit of $133.2 million at December 31, 2010 compared to a deficit of $121.5 million at December 31, 2009. 31 For information on pension and postretirement benefit plan contribution requirements, please see Future Liquidity Sources and Uses of Funds Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefit Plan Contribution Requirements. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for more information regarding costs of, and assumptions for, our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs. Tax Reserves, Contingencies and Litigation We establish reserves in connection with legal proceedings, claims and litigation when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time. Estimating probable losses requires analyses of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments concerning potential actions by third parties and regulators. In connection with tax proceedings, we utilize a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This is an inherently subjective and complex process, and actual results may differ from our estimates by material amounts. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when the following four conditions are met: Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; The contract fee is fixed and determinable; Delivery or performance has occurred; and Collectibility is reasonably assured. If at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment. If there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. If at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our Risk Management Solutions are generally sold under fixed price subscription contracts that allow customers unlimited access to risk information. Revenue on this type of contract is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is generally one year. Risk information is also sold using monthly or annual contracts that allow customers to purchase our risk information up to the contract amount based on an agreed price list. Once the contract amount is fully used, additional risk information can be purchased at per item prices which may be different than those in the original contract. Revenue on these contracts is recognized on a per item basis as information is purchased and delivered to the customer. If customers do not use the full amount of their contract and forfeit the unused portion, we recognize the forfeited amount as revenue at contract expiration. Where a data file of risk information is sold with periodic updates to that information, a portion of the revenue related to the updates is deferred as a liability on the balance sheet and recognized as the updates are delivered, usually on a quarterly or monthly basis over the term of the contract. Revenue related to services, such as monitoring, is recognized ratably over the period of performance. 32 Sales & Marketing Solutions that provide continuous access to our marketing information and business reference databases may include access or hosting fees which are sold on a subscription basis. Revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically one year. Where a data file of marketing information is sold, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the marketing data file to the customer. If the contract provides for periodic updates to that marketing data file, the portion of the revenue related to updates is deferred as a liability on the balance sheet and recognized as the updates are delivered, usually on a quarterly or monthly basis, over the term of the contract. Internet Solutions represent the results of our Hoovers business, including both the First Research division and the AllBusiness.com division. Hoovers and First Research provide subscription solutions that allow continuous access to our business information databases. Revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is generally one year. Any additional solutions purchased are recognized upon delivery to the customer. AllBusiness.com provides online media and e commerce products that provide advertisers the ability to target small business customers. Revenue is recognized as solutions are delivered to the customer over the contract period. Sales of software that are considered to be more than incidental are recognized in revenue when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed and the software has been shipped and installed, if required. Revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the services are performed. We have certain solution offerings that are sold as multi element arrangements. The multiple elements or deliverables may include access to our business information databases, information data files, updates, software and services. To account for each deliverable as a separate unit of accounting, they each must meet all of the following separation criteria: The delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a stand alone basis; There is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item(s); and If the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the undelivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control of the Company. If the deliverable or a group of deliverables meets the separation criteria, the total arrangement consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting based on its relative fair value. The amount of arrangement consideration that is allocated to a delivered unit of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another unit of accounting. We obtain vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of a deliverable by monitoring the price at which we sell the deliverable on a standalone basis. Where we are unable to use VSOE, we may use the price at which we or a third party sell a similar product to similarly situated customers on a standalone basis. If we do not have fair value for the delivered items, the contract fee is allocated to the undelivered items based on their fair values and the remaining residual amount, if any, is allocated to the delivered items. After the arrangement consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting, we apply the appropriate revenue recognition method from those described above for each unit of accounting, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. All deliverables that do not meet the separation criteria are combined with an undelivered unit of accounting. We generally recognize revenue for a combined unit of accounting based on the method most appropriate for the last delivered item. Deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales of our information solutions and generally relates to deferral of subscription revenue. Deferred revenue is included in current liabilities in the balance sheet and is subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies. 33 We record revenue on a net basis for those sales where we act as an agent or broker in the transaction. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for disclosure of the impact that recently issued accounting standards may have on our audited consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements. They should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes set forth in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Consolidated Revenue The following table presents our revenue by segment: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Revenue: North America $ 1,229.5 $ 1,239.4 $ 1,282.5 International 414.2 355.4 314.4 Core Revenue 1,643.7 1,594.8 1,596.9 Divested Businesses 32.9 92.2 129.4 Total Revenue $ 1,676.6 $ 1,687.0 $ 1,726.3 The following table presents our revenue by customer solution set: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Revenue: Risk Management Solutions $ 1,036.7 $ 1,002.2 $ 988.7 Sales & Marketing Solutions 492.1 474.6 483.3 Internet Solutions 114.9 118.0 124.9 Core Revenue 1,643.7 1,594.8 1,596.9 Divested Businesses 32.9 92.2 129.4 Total Revenue $ 1,676.6 $ 1,687.0 $ 1,726.3 Year ended December 31, 2010 vs. Year ended December 31, 2009 Total revenue decreased $10.4 million, or 1% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in total revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in North America total revenue of $47.3 million, or 4% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange) partially offset by an increase in International total revenue of $36.9 million, or 10% (9% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). North America total revenue was negatively impacted by the divestiture of our North American Self Awareness Solutions business in the third quarter of 2010, which 34 we reclassified as a divested business and accounted for $32.9 million and $70.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. International total revenue was negatively impacted by our divestiture of the domestic portion of our Italian operations in the second quarter of 2009, which we reclassified as a divested business and accounted for $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition, International total revenue was positively impacted by the acquisition of D&B Australia which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2010. Core revenue, which reflects total revenue less revenue from a divested business, increased $48.9 million, or 3% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in core revenue is primarily attributed to: Increased revenue as a result of the following acquisitions: a) D&B Australia which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2010; b) substantially all of the assets of Bisnodes UK operations and a 100% equity interest in Bisnodes Irish operation (ICC) which we consolidated in the third quarter of 2009; c) Quality Education Data (QED) which we consolidated in the first quarter of 2009; and our majority owned joint venture with Roadway International Limited (RoadWay) in China which we consolidated in the third quarter of 2009; all of which in the aggregate, contributed three points of the growth; Increased purchases by new and existing customers in certain of our International markets; partially offset by: Lower purchases from our customers due to a weak economy and budgetary pressures. Customer Solution Set On a customer solution set basis, the $48.9 million increase in core revenue reflects: A $34.5 million, or 3% increase (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), in Risk Management Solutions. The increase was driven by an increase in International of $42.3 million, or 16% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), partially offset by a decrease in North America of $7.8 million, or 1% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange); A $17.5 million, or 4% increase (3% increase before the effect of foreign exchange), in Sales & Marketing Solutions. The increase was driven by an increase in International of $16.5 million, or 19% (16% increase before the effect of foreign exchange), and an increase in North America of $1.0 million, or less than 1% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange); and A $3.1 million, or 3% decrease (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), in Internet Solutions. The decrease was driven by a decrease in North America of $3.1 million, or 3% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. Year ended December 31, 2008 Total revenue decreased $39.3 million, or 2% (1% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in total revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in North America total revenue of $54.5 million, or 4% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange) partially offset by an increase in International total revenue of $15.2 million, or 4% (14% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). North America total revenue was negatively impacted by the divested North American Self Awareness Solutions business in the third quarter of 2010, which we reclassified as a divested business and accounted for $70.3 million and $81.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. International total revenue was negatively impacted by the divestiture of the domestic portion of our Italian operations in the second quarter of 2009, which had been reclassified as a divested business and accounted for $21.9 million and $47.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 35 Core revenue, which reflects total revenue less revenue from a divested business, decreased $2.1 million, or less than 1% (2% increase before the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in core revenue is primarily attributed to: Lower purchases from our customers due to a weak economy and budgetary pressures; and The negative impact of foreign exchange; partially offset by: Increased revenue as a result of a) our majority owned joint ventures we entered into: i) Dun & Bradstreet Information Services India Private Limited (D&B India) which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2008; ii) HC International, Inc. in China which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2008; and iii) RoadWay in China which we consolidated in the third quarter of 2009; b) the following acquisitions: i) ICC which we consolidated in the third quarter of 2009; and ii) QED which we consolidated in the first quarter of 2009, all of which in the aggregate, contributed three points of the growth; Growth in each of our subscription plans from existing customers, including the customers who previously purchased value added solutions. These subscription plans provide our customers with unlimited use of our Risk Management reports and data; and Increased revenue from our Asia Pacific market, primarily from our majority owned Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture. Customer Solution Set On a customer solution set basis, the $2.1 million decrease in core revenue reflects: A $13.5 million, or 1% increase (4% increase before the effect of foreign exchange), in Risk Management Solutions. The increase was driven by an increase in International of $17.8 million, or 7% (18% increase before the effect of foreign exchange), partially offset by a decrease in North America of $4.3 million, or 1% (less than 1% before the effect of foreign exchange); An $8.7 million, or 2% decrease (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), in Sales & Marketing Solutions. The decrease was driven by a decrease in North America of $32.8 million, or 8% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), partially offset by an increase in International of $24.1 million, or 37% (42% increase before the effect of foreign exchange); and A $6.9 million, or 6% decrease (5% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange), in Internet Solutions. The decrease was driven by a decrease in North America of $6.0 million, or 5% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange) and a decrease in International of $0.9 million, or 20% (3% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange). Consolidated Operating Costs The following table presents our consolidated operating costs and operating income: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Operating Expenses $ 557.7 $ 500.3 $ 480.7 Selling and Administrative Expenses 626.9 641.0 686.0 Depreciation and Amortization 68.1 58.1 58.5 Restructuring Charge 14.8 23.1 31.4 Operating Costs $ 1,267.5 $ 1,222.5 $ 1,256.6 Operating Income $ 409.1 $ 464.5 $ 469.7 36 Operating Expenses Year ended December 31, 2010 vs. Year ended December 31, 2009 Operating expenses increased by $57.4 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to the following: Increased data acquisition costs and fulfillment costs primarily associated with the following acquisitions: a) D&B Australia which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2010; b) ICC which we consolidated in the third quarter of 2009; and our majority owned joint venture with RoadWay in China which we consolidated in the third quarter of 2009; Increased costs associated with our investments, including $30.3 million for our Strategic Technology Investment designed to strengthen our leading position in commercial data and improve our current technology platform to meet emerging needs of customers; Impairment of certain intangible assets related to our Purisma product; Increased compensation costs; and The negative impact of foreign exchange; partially offset by: Lower expenses related to our divestiture of the domestic portion of our Italian operations and our North American Self Awareness Solution business; and Our ongoing reengineering efforts. Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. Year ended December 31, 2008 Operating expenses increased by $19.6 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to the following: Increased data acquisition costs and fulfillment costs primarily associated with a) our majority owned joint ventures in: i) D&B India which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2008; ii) HC International, Inc. in China which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2009; iii) RoadWay in China which we consolidated in the third quarter of 2009; and iv) Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2007; and b) our acquisition of ICC which we consolidated in the third quarter of 2009; and Increased costs associated with our investments; partially offset by: The positive impact of foreign exchange; and Lower costs as a result of our ongoing reengineering efforts and decreased variable expenses (e.g., professional fees and travel related expenses). Selling and Administrative Expenses Year ended December 31, 2010 vs. Year ended December 31, 2009 Selling and administrative expenses decreased $14.1 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the following: Lower expenses related to our divestiture of our North American Self Awareness Solution business and the domestic portion of our Italian operations; and Our ongoing reengineering efforts; 37 partially offset by: Increased selling expenses primarily associated with the following acquisitions: a) D&B Australia which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2010; b) ICC which we consolidated in the third quarter of 2009; and our majority owned joint venture with RoadWay in China which we consolidated in the third quarter of 2009; Increased costs due to our product investments, including $5.5 million for our Strategic Technology Investment designed to strengthen our leading position in commercial data and improve our current technology platform to meet emerging needs of customers; Impairment of certain intangible assets related to our QED acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2009; and The negative impact of foreign exchange. Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. Year ended December 31, 2008 Selling and administrative expenses decreased $45.0 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the following: Lower costs as a result of our ongoing reengineering efforts (e.g., our Go To Market approach for our North American sales organization) and decreased variable expenses (e.g., commissions and bonuses, professional fees, and travel related expenses); and The positive impact of foreign exchange; partially offset by: Increased selling expenses primarily associated with a) our majority owned joint ventures in: i) D&B India which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2008; ii) HC International, Inc. in China which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2008; iii) RoadWay in China which we consolidated in the third quarter of 2009; and iv) Tokyo Shoko Research/D&B Japan Joint Venture which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2007; and b) the following acquisitions: i) ICC which we consolidated in the third quarter of 2009; and ii) QED which we consolidated in the first quarter 2009. Matters Impacting Both Operating Expenses and Selling and Administrative Expenses Pension, Postretirement and 401(k) Plan For our pension plans globally, we had a net pension periodic cost of $5.8 million, $6.0 million and net pension periodic income of $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The fluctuation in the pension cost/income was due to the following: The discount rates applied to the pension plans were major factors in driving the pension costs to fluctuate from year to year. The lower the discount rate, the higher the pension cost. The discount rate used to measure the pension costs for our U.S. plans for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was 5.72%, 6.10% and 6.37%, respectively. Actuarial loss amortization included in annual pension expense was also a major factor in driving the pension costs to fluctuate from year to year. Actuarial loss amortization was largely impacted by the discount rate, amortization period and plan experience. The lower the discount rate, the higher the loss amortization. Actuarial loss amortization included in annual pension expense for all global plans was $21.5 million, $22.5 million, and $16.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of which $19.0 million, $21.5 million and $14.1 million were attributable to our U.S. plans for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Lower actuarial loss amortization in the U.S. plans was primarily driven by a longer amortization period applied to the 38 U.S. Qualified Plan, substantially offset by the impact of lower discount rates applied to our plans at January 1, 2010 and higher actuarial losses subject to amortization. Starting in November 2009, the amortization period applied to the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses for our U.S. Qualified Plan has been changed from average future service years of active participants to average life expectancy of all plan participants. The change was the result of almost all the plan participants being deemed inactive. Pension income in 2008 was primarily due to the higher discount rate applied to our U.S. plans and the major International plans, as well as lower actuarial loss amortization included in 2008. We expect that the net pension cost in 2011 will be approximately $10 million for all of our global pension plans, of which approximately $5 million will be attributable to each of the U.S. plans and non U.S. plans. This compares to a net pension cost of $5.8 million in 2010, which included pension income of $0.4 million and pension cost of $6.2 million attributable to the U.S. plans and non U.S. plans, respectively. For our U.S. plans, lower expected return from plan assets resulting from lower market related value of plan assets will increase our 2011 net pension cost. Higher actuarial losses amortization will be substantially offset by lower interest cost, both driven by a lower discount rate. The discount rate applied to our U.S. plans at January 1, 2011, is 59 basis points lower than 2010. Lower pension cost in 2011 for our International plan is primarily due to a statutory change in the inflation assumption which results in lower interest cost and lower actuarial loss amortization. We had postretirement benefit income of $7.0 million, $1.3 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Higher income in 2010 was primarily due to higher amortization of prior service credits. During the first quarter of 2010, the retiree company paid life insurance benefits were eliminated. In addition, we will only share the minimum necessary amount of subsidy received from the government in any year to maintain actuarial equivalence for as long as possible. This plan change was approved in December 2009 and as a result we reduced our accumulated postretirement obligation by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009, which will be amortized over approximately four years. Effective July 1, 2010, in connection with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, we converted the current prescription drug program for retirees over 65 to a group based company sponsored Medicare Part D program, or EGWP. Beginning in 2013, we will use the Part D subsidies delivered through the EGWP each year to reduce net company retiree medical costs until net company costs are completely eliminated. At that time, the Part D subsidies will be shared with retirees going forward to reduce retiree contributions. As a result, we reduced our accumulated postretirement obligation by $21 million in the third quarter of 2010, which will be amortized over approximately four years. Both plan changes were accounted for as plan amendments under ASC 715 60 35, Compensation Retirement Benefits. Lower postretirement benefit income in 2009 was primarily due to full amortization of the prior service credit. This prior service credit was related to the 2003 plan amendment to limit our insurance premium contribution. Higher postretirement benefit income in 2008 was primarily due to higher amortization of actuarial gain, which was driven by positive plan experience and changes in assumptions. We expect postretirement benefit income will be approximately $11 million in 2011. The increase in income from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to higher amortization of prior service credits as explained above. We had expense associated with our 401(k) Plan of $9.7 million, $6.9 million and $19.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in expense in 2010 was due to an incremental discretionary company contribution of $4.5 million resulting from company performance. In addition, we amended our employer matching provision in the 401(k) Plan, effective in April 2010, to increase the employer maximum match from 50% of three percent (3%) to 50% of seven percent (7%) of a team members eligible compensation, subject to certain 401(k) Plan limitations. The decrease in expense in 2009 was due to the amendment of our employer matching provision in the 401(k) Plan effective in February, 2009, to decrease our match formula from 100% to 50% of a team members contributions and to decrease the maximum 39 match from seven percent (7%) to three percent (3%) of such team members eligible compensation, subject to certain 401(k) Plan limitations. We consider net pension cost and postretirement benefit income to be part of our compensation costs, and, therefore, they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses, based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs. See the discussion of Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations, above, and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Stock Based Compensation For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized total stock based compensation expense (e.g., stock options, restricted stock, etc.) of $18.3 million, $22.3 million and $27.6 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized expense associated with our stock option programs of $6.5 million, $9.5 million and $11.0 million, respectively. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009, was primarily due to higher forfeitures, partially offset by the accelerated expensing of an award issued to a retiree eligible senior executive. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 2008, was primarily due to a decrease in the overall number of employees eligible for stock options. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized expense associated with our restricted stock, restricted stock units and restricted stock opportunity programs of $11.0 million, $11.9 million and $15.6 million, respectively. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009, was primarily due to higher forfeitures associated with terminated employees as well as fewer awards being issued in 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, partially offset by the accelerated expensing of an award issued to a retiree eligible senior executive. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008, was primarily driven by performance based awards being below target, resulting in lower expense. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized expense associated with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) of $0.8 million, $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively. We consider these costs to be part of our compensation costs and, therefore, they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses, based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs. Depreciation and Amortization Year ended December 31, 2010 vs. Year ended December 31, 2009 Depreciation and amortization increased $10.0 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily driven by an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions and our majority owned joint ventures, increased capital costs for revenue generating investments to enhance our strategic capabilities and our Strategic Technology Investment. This increase was partially offset by a reassessment in 2009 of the useful lives of our computer software (discussed in further detail below). Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. Year ended December 31, 2008 Depreciation and amortization decreased $0.4 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily driven by a 40 reassessment of the useful lives of our computer software. We review the estimated remaining useful lives of our computer software and may extend the useful life when events and circumstances indicate the computer software can operate beyond its original or current useful life. Prior to the second quarter of 2009, the useful life of computer software assets was typically three to five years. We now expect the useful life of our back end and back office software to be in the range of five to eight years, and we have extended the useful lives accordingly. This reassessment included a review of the major components of our strategy and consideration of the effects of obsolescence, technology, competition and other economic factors on the useful life of these assets. The impact of this change was effective in the second quarter of 2009, and the impact for the year ended December 31, 2009 was a reduction in software amortization expense by approximately $7 million after tax ($0.14 per diluted share). The decrease was partially offset by an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions and our majority owned joint ventures and increased capital costs for revenue generating investments to enhance our strategic capabilities. Restructuring Charge Financial Flexibility is an ongoing process by which we seek to reallocate our spending from low growth or low value activities to other activities that will create greater value for shareholders through enhanced revenue growth, improved profitability and or quality improvements. With most initiatives, we have incurred restructuring charges (which generally consist of employee severance and termination costs, contract terminations, asset write offs, and or costs to terminate lease obligations less assumed sublease income). These charges are incurred as a result of eliminating, consolidating, standardizing and or automating our business functions. We have also incurred transition costs such as consulting fees, costs of temporary workers, relocation costs and stay bonuses to implement our Financial Flexibility initiatives. Restructuring charges have been recorded in accordance with ASC 712 10, Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits, or ASC 712 10, and or ASC 420 10, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, or ASC 420 10, as appropriate. We record severance costs provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement once they are both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of ASC 712 10. We account for one time termination benefits, contract terminations, asset write offs, and or costs to terminate lease obligations less assumed sublease income in accordance with ASC 420 10, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with restructuring activities. Under ASC 420 10, we establish a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity, including severance and lease termination obligations, and other related costs, when the liability is incurred, rather than at the date that we commit to an exit plan. We reassess the expected cost to complete the exit or disposal activities at the end of each reporting period and adjust our remaining estimated liabilities, if necessary. The determination of when we accrue for severance costs and which standard applies depends on whether the termination benefits are provided under an ongoing arrangement as described in ASC 712 10 or under a one time benefit arrangement as defined by ASC 420 10. Inherent in the estimation of the costs related to the restructurings are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the exit activities. In determining the charges related to the restructurings, we had to make estimates related to the expenses associated with the restructurings. These estimates may vary significantly from actual costs depending, in part, upon factors that may be beyond our control. We will continue to review the status of our restructuring obligations on a quarterly basis and, if appropriate, record changes to these obligations in current operations based on managements most current estimates. 41 During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a $14.8 million restructuring charge in connection with Financial Flexibility initiatives. The significant components of these charges included: Severance and termination costs of $11.7 million in accordance with the provisions of ASC 712 10 were recorded. Approximately 325 employees were impacted. Of these 325 employees, approximately 315 employees have exited the Company and approximately 10 employees will exit the Company in 2011. The cash payments for these employees will be substantially completed by the second quarter of 2011; and Lease termination obligations, other costs to consolidate or close facilities and other exit costs of $3.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a $23.1 million restructuring charge in connection with Financial Flexibility initiatives. The significant components of these charges included: Severance and termination costs of $12.7 million in accordance with the provisions of ASC 712 10 were recorded. Approximately 535 employees were impacted; and Lease termination obligations, other costs to consolidate or close facilities and other exit costs of $10.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a $31.4 million restructuring charge in connection with Financial Flexibility initiatives. The significant components of these charges included: Severance and termination costs of $27.5 million in accordance with the provisions of ASC 712 10 were recorded. In total, approximately 500 employees were impacted; and Severance and termination costs of $3.0 million in accordance with the provisions of ASC 420 10 were recorded. In total, approximately 40 employees were impacted. Interest Income (Expense) Net The following table presents our Interest Income (Expense) Net: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Interest Income $ 2.1 $ 3.0 $ 11.5 Interest Expense (46.0 ) (45.7 ) (47.4 ) Interest Income (Expense) Net $ (43.9 ) $ (42.7 ) $ (35.9 ) Interest income decreased $0.9 million, or 30%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009, primarily attributable to lower interest rates. Interest income decreased $8.5 million, or 74%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008, primarily attributable to lower interest rates, as well as lower amounts of invested cash. Interest expense increased by $0.3 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009, primarily attributable to higher amounts of average debt outstanding partially offset by lower interest rates. Interest expense decreased by $1.7 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008, primarily attributable to lower interest rates partially offset by higher amounts of average debt outstanding. 42 Other Income (Expense) Net The following table presents the components of Other Income (Expense) Net: For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Effect of Legacy Tax Matters(a) $ (0.4 ) $ 1.0 $ 1.2 Gain on Disposal of North American Self Awareness Solutions Business(b) 23.1 One Time Gain on Hedge of Purchase Price on the Australia Acquisition(c) 3.4 Gain on Disposal of Italian Domestic Business(d) 6.5 Settlement of Legacy Tax Matter Arbitration(e) 4.1 8.1 Legacy Tax Matter Related to the Settlement of 2003 Tax Year(f) (7.7 ) Gain Associated with Beijing D&B HuiCong Market Research Co., Ltd.

(e) During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recognized gains on the receipt of awards related to Legacy Tax Matters. (f) During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized the reduction of a contractual receipt under the Tax Allocation Agreement between Moodys Corporation and D&B as it relates to the expiration of the statute of limitations. (g) During the year ended December 31, 2008, we entered into an agreement with HC International Inc. and established two joint venture companies including Beijing D&B HuiCong Market Research Co., Ltd. and Beijing HuiCong Market Research Co. Ltd., in which D&B has a 60% and 30% ownership interest, respectively. We recognized a gain of $0.6 million related to the minority owners share of the difference between the fair value of our contributed business and its carrying amount. (h) Miscellaneous Other Income (Expense) Net decreased for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to the premium payment of $3.7 million made for the redemption of the $300 million senior notes with a maturity date of March 15, 2011 (the 2011 notes). See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Miscellaneous Other Income (Expense) Net decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange. 43 Provision for Income Taxes Effective Tax Rate for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 29.2 % Impact of Benefits Derived From Worldwide Legal Entity Simplification (7.0 )% Impact of Settlement of Global Tax Audits 3.2 % Other 0.5 % Effective Tax Rate for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 25.9 % Impact From Worldwide Legal Entity Simplification 9.5 % Impact of Legacy Tax Matters (4.0 )% Reduction of a Deferred Tax Asset Resulting from the Healthcare Act of 2010 3.7 % Other 0.4 % Effective Tax Rate for the Year Ended December 31, 2010 35.5 % Discontinued Operations On December 27, 2007, we sold our Italian real estate business for $9.0 million, which was a part of our International segment, and we have reclassified the historical financial results of the Italian real estate business as discontinued operations. We have reflected the results of this business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented as set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We have recorded the resulting gain of $0.4 million (both pre tax and after tax) from the sale in the first quarter of 2008 in the consolidated statement of operations. Earnings Per Share In accordance with authoritative guidance in ASC 260 10, we are required to assess if any of our share based payment transactions are deemed participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation when computing EPS under the two class method. The two class method requires earnings to be allocated between common shareholders and holders of participating securities. All outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends are considered to be a separate class of common stock and should be included in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS. Based on a review of our stock based awards, we have determined that only our restricted stock awards are deemed participating securities. We adopted the authoritative guidance regarding share based payments effective January 1, 2009. The impact of the adoption resulted in a four cent and two cent decrease to our basic and diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2008. The weighted average restricted shares outstanding was 196,175 shares, 361,900 shares and 394,591 shares for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The following table sets forth our EPS: For Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Basic Earnings Per Share of Common Stock: Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to D&B Common Shareholders $ 5.03 $ 6.06 $ 5.65 Income from Discontinued Operations Attributable to D&B Common Shareholders 0.02 Basic Earnings Per Share of Common Stock Attributable to D&B Common Shareholders $ 5.03 $ 6.06 $ 5.67 Diluted Earnings Per Share of Common Stock: Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to D&B Common Shareholders $ 4.98 $ 5.99 $ 5.56 Income from Discontinued Operations Attributable to D&B Common Shareholders 0.02 Diluted Earnings Per Share of Common Stock Attributable to D&B Common Shareholders $ 4.98 $ 5.99 $ 5.58 44 For the year ended December 31, 2010, both basic EPS attributable to D&B common shareholders and diluted EPS attributable to D&B common shareholders decreased 17%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to a 21% decrease in Net Income Attributable to D&B, partially offset by a 5% reduction in the weighted average number of basic and diluted shares outstanding resulting from our total share repurchases. For the year ended December 31, 2009, both basic EPS attributable to D&B common shareholders and diluted EPS attributable to D&B common shareholders increased 7% compared with the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to a 3% increase in Net Income Attributable to D&B and a 4% reduction in the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding resulting from our total share repurchases. Segment Results Our results are reported under the following two segments: North America and International. The segments reported below are our segments for which separate financial information is available and upon which operating results are evaluated on a timely basis to assess performance and to allocate resources. North America North America is our largest segment representing 75%, 78% and 79% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. On July 30, 2010, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our North American Self Awareness Solution business. This business has been classified as a Divested Business. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further detail. This divested business contributed 2%, 5% and 6% of our North America total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. North America represented 75%, 78% and 80% of our core revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The following table presents our North America revenue by customer solution set and North America operating income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Additionally, this table reconciles the non GAAP measure of core revenue to the GAAP measure of total revenue by customer solution set. For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Revenue: Risk Management Solutions $ 731.5 $ 739.3 $ 743.6 Sales & Marketing Solutions 386.5 385.5 418.3 Internet Solutions 111.5 114.6 120.6 North America Core Revenue 1,229.5 1,239.4 1,282.5 Divested Business 32.9 70.3 81.7 North America Total Revenue $ 1,262.4 $ 1,309.7 $ 1,364.2 Operating Income $ 452.2 $ 482.5 $ 513.3 45 Year ended December 31, 2010 vs. Year ended December 31, 2009 North America Overview North America total revenue decreased $47.3 million, or 4% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. North America total revenue was negatively impacted by the divestiture of our North American Self Awareness Solution business in the third quarter of 2010, which we reclassified as a divested business and accounted for $32.9 million and $70.3 million in revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Excluding the impact of the divestiture, core revenue decreased $9.9 million, or 1% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). North America Customer Solution Sets On a customer solution set basis, the $9.9 million decrease in core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, reflects: Risk Management Solutions A decrease in Risk Management Solutions of $7.8 million, or 1% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). For the year ended December 31, 2010, Traditional Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 68% of total North America Risk Management Solutions, decreased 2% (3% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange). The decrease was primarily due to: Lower volumes of credit origination resulting in lower transactional volumes as well as a lower demand in earlier periods for our ratable subscription products; partially offset by: Year over year growth in our subscription plans for DNBi throughout 2010 due to continued high retention and increased dollar spend per customer resulting from an increased emphasis on our value proposition; and higher purchases from our existing customers as they converted from our legacy products to subscription plans for DNBi, including the customers who previously purchased value added solutions. These subscription plans provide our customers with unlimited use of our Risk Management reports and data. We continue to see single digit price increases when existing customers renew these subscription plans and double digit price increases when customers convert to DNBi. However, with more than half of our Risk Management Solutions revenue derived from DNBi, we have a far smaller base available for conversion in the future. For the year ended December 31, 2010, Value Added Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 23% of total North America Risk Management Solutions, remained flat compared to prior year. This was primarily due to: The impact of lower volumes of credit origination due to the macroeconomic environment has translated into lower transactional volumes as well as a lower demand in earlier periods for our ratable subscription products (as noted above); and A shift in product mix to our DNBi subscriptions plans from our Value Added Risk Management Solutions to our Traditional Risk Management Solutions (as noted above); offset by: Higher purchases from existing customers of modules enabled by our DNBi platform which are included in our Value Added Risk Management Solutions; and Increased sales to existing customers of Value Added credit decisioning solutions. 46 For the year ended December 31, 2010, Supply Management Solutions, which accounted for 9% of total North America Risk Management Solutions, increased 8% (7% increase before the effect of foreign exchange), on a small base. Sales & Marketing Solutions An increase in Sales & Marketing Solutions of $1.0 million, or less than 1% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). For the year ended December 31, 2010, Traditional Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 33% of total North America Sales & Marketing Solutions, decreased 11% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The decrease was primarily due to: Lower purchases from our customers due to a weak economy and budgetary pressures. These budgetary pressures have caused our customers to further focus their marketing efforts and, in some cases, shift from direct mail activities to digital marketing to reduce costs; partially offset by: Increased revenue to existing customers in our education marketing solutions business; and Increased revenue associated with our acquisition of QED completed in the first quarter of 2009, which contributed one point of the growth. For the year ended December 31, 2010, Value Added Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 67% of total North America Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 7% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was primarily due to: Increased cross selling of our Sales & Marketing Solutions value added solutions into our customer base, and cross selling within the Sales & Marketing Solutions value added solutions customer base (including the cross selling of new solutions for digital marketing); New customer acquisition and increased commitments within certain of our solutions; and A timing benefit from a significant customer consolidating the contractual expiration dates for multiple contracts, some of which would have renewed in future periods; partially offset by: Lower purchases of our value added products due to budgetary pressures on our customers. In this environment customers are continuing to defer or decrease spend or not renew. Internet Solutions A decrease in Internet Solutions of $3.1 million, or 3% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), as a result of a decline in our 2009 subscription renewal sales and a loss of a large customer deal not renewing. We expect the North American segment to perform better than 2010 and return to growth in 2011. Specifically, we expect revenue growth for 2011 to be in the low single digits. We expect growth in the second half of the year to be better than the first half as we gain traction on the launch of new products such as DNB.com, DNBi Pro and D&B360, all of which have ratable revenue. 47 North America Operating Income North America operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $452.2 million, compared to $482.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $30.3 million, or 6%. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to: A decrease in North America total revenue; Impairment of intangible assets related to our Purisma product and QED acquisition; and Increased costs associated with our investments; partially offset by: Lower costs as a result of our ongoing reengineering efforts and decreased variable expenses (e.g., commissions, etc.); and Lower costs as a result of our divestiture of our North American Self Awareness Solution business. Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. Year ended December 31, 2008 North America Overview North America total revenue decreased $54.5 million, or 4% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. North America total revenue was negatively impacted by the divested North American Self Awareness Solution business in the third quarter of 2010, which we reclassified as a divested business and accounted for $70.3 million and $81.7 million in revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Excluding the impact of the divestiture, core revenue decreased $43.1 million, or 3% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). North America Customer Solution Sets On a customer solution set basis, the $43.1 million decrease in core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, reflects: Risk Management Solutions A decrease in Risk Management Solutions of $4.3 million, or 1% (less than 1% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange). For the year ended December 31, 2009, Traditional Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 69% of total North America Risk Management Solutions, decreased 1% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The decrease was primarily due to: Lower purchases of our traditional legacy products due to economic and budgetary pressures; partially offset by: Higher purchases due to a conversion from our legacy products to subscription plans from existing customers including the customers who previously purchased value added solutions. These subscription plans provide our customers with unlimited use of our Risk Management reports and data. We continue to see high single digit price lifts when existing customers renew and double digit price lifts when customers convert to DNBi. Also, with more than half of our Risk Management Solutions revenue already on DNBi, we have a smaller base available for conversion. 48 For the year ended December 31, 2009, Value Added Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 23% of total North America Risk Management Solutions, decreased 3% (2% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange). The decrease was primarily due to: Lower purchases of our legacy VAPs products from our customers due to economic and budgetary pressures; partially offset by: Higher purchases from existing customers of new modules enabled by our DNBi platform. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Supply Management Solutions, which accounted for 8% of total North America Risk Management Solutions, increased 9% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), on a small base. Sales & Marketing Solutions A decrease in Sales & Marketing Solutions of $32.8 million, or 8% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). For the year ended December 31, 2009, Traditional Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 37% of total North America Sales & Marketing Solutions, decreased 12% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The decrease was primarily due to: Lower purchases of our legacy products from our customers due to a weak economy and budgetary pressures. This is largely driven by a secular trend, as customers shift from direct mail activities to digital marketing to reduce costs; and A shift in timing of early renewals (primarily into 2008); partially offset by: Increased revenue associated with our acquisition of QED completed in the first quarter of 2009, which contributed five points of the growth. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Value Added Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 63% of total North America Sales & Marketing Solutions, decreased 5% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The decrease was primarily due to: Lower purchases of our legacy products from our customers due to economic pressures. We continue to have consistent customer retention but the dollar spend per customer has declined; and A shift in timing of early renewals (primarily into 2008); partially offset by: Higher purchases from certain of our customers due to our providing more value through bundled offerings. Internet Solutions A decrease in Internet Solutions of $6.0 million, or 5% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange), as a result of a decline in renewal sales of our subscription plans triggered by a reduction in the budgets of our customers and a decline in advertising revenue partially offset by a benefit from one large customer deal. 49 North America Operating Income North America operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $482.5 million, compared to $513.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $30.8 million, or 6%. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to: A decrease in North America revenue; Increased costs associated with our investments; and An increase in expenses primarily associated with the acquisition of QED; partially offset by: Lower costs as a result of our ongoing reengineering efforts and decreased variable expenses (e.g., commissions, bonuses and travel related expenses). International International represented 25%, 22% and 21% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. On May 29, 2009, we completed the sale of substantially all the assets and liabilities of the domestic portion of our Italian operations. This sale has been classified as a Divested Business. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further detail. This divested business contributed 6% and 13% of our International total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. International represented 25%, 22% and 20% of our core revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The following table presents our International revenue by customer solution set and International operating income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Additionally, this table reconciles the non GAAP measure of core revenue to the GAAP measure of total revenue by customer solution set.

International total revenue was negatively impacted by the divestiture of the domestic portion of our Italian operations in the second quarter of 2009, which we reclassified as a divested business and accounted for $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Excluding the impact of the divestiture, core revenue increased $58.8 million, or 17% (16% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). International Customer Solution Sets On a customer solution set basis, the $58.8 million increase in International core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, reflects: Risk Management Solutions An increase in Risk Management Solutions of $42.3 million, or 16% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). For the year ended December 31, 2010, Traditional Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 86% of International Risk Management Solutions, increased 13% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange). The increase in Traditional Risk Management solutions was primarily due to: Increased revenue as a result of the acquisitions of ICC which we consolidated in the third quarter of 2009 and D&B Australia which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2010, which in the aggregate contributed fourteen points of the growth; Increased revenue due to the launch of new products and increased usage; and Increased revenue from providing cross border data to members of our D&B Worldwide Network attributable to fulfillment services and product usage and our commercial agreement to provide global data entered into in connection with our divestiture of the domestic portion of our Italian operations. For the year ended December 31, 2010, Value Added Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 13% of International Risk Management Solutions, decreased 2% (1% decrease before the effect of foreign exchange) primarily due to: Decreased purchases in certain of our markets by our customers due to economic and budgetary pressures; partially offset by: Our commercial agreement to provide global data entered into in connection with our divestiture of the domestic portion of our Italian operations. For the year ended December 31, 2010, Supply Management Solutions, which accounted for 1% of International Risk Management Solutions, increased 8% (both before and after the effect of foreign exchange) on a small base. Sales & Marketing Solutions An increase in Sales & Marketing Solutions of $16.5 million, or 19% (16% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). 51 For the year ended December 31, 2010, Traditional Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 58% of International Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 31% (29% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). This increase was primarily due to: Increased revenue as a result of the acquisition of ICC which we consolidated in the third quarter of 2009 and our majority owned joint venture with RoadWay in China which we consolidated in the third quarter of 2009, which in the aggregate, contributed eighteen points of the growth; and Increased purchases by new and existing customers in certain of our markets; partially offset by: A decrease in revenue in certain markets primarily due to competitive pressures and signing delays. For the year ended December 31, 2010, Value Added Sales & Marketing Solutions, which accounted for 42% of International Sales & Marketing Solutions, increased 5% (1% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). The increase was primarily due to: The positive impact of foreign exchange; and Increased purchases from existing customers in our UK market; partially offset by: Lower purchases by existing customers in certain of our Asia Pacific markets. Customers in this region are carefully managing their value added marketing spend due to continued economic pressures. Internet Solutions Our Internet Solutions remained flat compared to prior year. International Operating Income International operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $71.6 million, compared to $81.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $9.5 million, or 12%, primarily due to: Revenue decline in certain of our Asia Pacific markets, where expenses are more fixed in nature; Data costs in certain of our Asia Pacific markets; and The negative impact of foreign exchange; partially offset by: An increase in core revenue; Lower costs as a result of our divestiture of the domestic portion of our Italian operations; and Lower costs as a result of our ongoing reengineering efforts. Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. Year ended December 31, 2008 International Overview International total revenue increased $15.2 million, or 4% (14% increase before the effect of foreign exchange), for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. International total revenue was negatively impacted by the divestiture of the domestic portion of our Italian operations in the second quarter of 2009, which we reclassified as a divested business and accounted for $21.9 million and $47.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Excluding the impact of the divestiture, core revenue increased $41.0 million, or 13% (23% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). 52 International Customer Solution Sets On a customer solution set basis, the $41.0 million increase in International core revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, reflects: Risk Management Solutions An increase in Risk Management Solutions of $17.8 million, or 7% (18% increase before the effect of foreign exchange). For the year ended December 31, 2009, Traditional Risk Management Solutions, which accounted for 84% of International Risk Management Solutions, increased 12% (22% increase before the effect of foreign exchange).

Market Risk We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of certain of our investments. 54 We employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies. We use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge short term foreign currency denominated loans, investments and certain third party and intercompany transactions. We may use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge investments and reduce our International earnings exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. In addition, we may use interest rate derivatives to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure on our outstanding debt or in anticipation of future debt issuance, as discussed under Interest Rate Risk Management below. A discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Interest Rate Risk Management Fair Value Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, we assess quarterly whether the swaps are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged debt. Changes in fair values of interest rate swap agreements that are designated fair value hedges are recognized in earnings as an adjustment of Other Income (Expense) Net in our consolidated statement of operations. The effectiveness of hedge accounting is monitored on an ongoing basis, and if considered ineffective, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. In November 2010, we issued senior notes with a face value of $300 million that mature on November 15, 2015 (the 2015 notes). In November and December 2010, we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of $125 million. The objective of these hedges is to offset the change in fair value of the fixed rate 2015 notes attributable to changes in LIBOR. These transactions are accounted for as fair value hedges. We will recognize the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item, in Other Income (Expense) Net in our consolidated statement of operations. Approximately $1.5 million of derivative losses offset by a $1.4 million gain on the fair value adjustment related to the hedged debt were recorded through December 31, 2010. Cash Flow Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings. In January 2009 and December 2008, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $25 million and $75 million, respectively, and designated these swaps as cash flow hedges against variability in cash flows related to our bank revolving credit facility. These transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value of the hedges are recorded in AOCI. At December 31, 2010, the balance of net derivative losses associated with these swaps included in AOCI was $1.4 million. In April 2008, we issued senior notes with a face value of $400 million that mature on April 1, 2013 (the 2013 notes). In January 2008, we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of $400 million. The objective of these hedges was to mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in Treasury rates in the anticipation of the issuance of the 2013 notes. These transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the 55 date of debt issuance were recorded in AOCI. In connection with the issuance of the 2013 notes, these interest rate derivative transactions were terminated, resulting in a loss and a payment of $8.5 million at the date of termination. The payments are recorded in AOCI, and will be amortized over the life of the 2013 notes. In March 2006, we issued senior notes with a face value of $300 million that matured on March 15, 2011 (the 2011 notes). In February 2006 and September 2005, we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of $100 million and $200 million, respectively. The objective of these hedges was to mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in Treasury rates in the anticipation of the 2011 notes. These transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges, and as such, changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of debt issuance were recorded in AOCI. In connection with the issuance of the 2011 notes, these interest rate derivative transactions were terminated, resulting in a gain and a receipt of $5.0 million at the date of termination. As a result of the redemption of the 2011 notes, the unamortized balance related to these interest rate derivative transactions was written off in Other Income (Expense) Net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2006, we had a $300 million bank revolving credit facility available at prevailing short term interest rates, which we terminated on April 19, 2007, and then entered into a new $500 million, five year bank revolving credit facility, which expires in April 2012. On January 25, 2008, we exercised a $150 million expansion feature on our $500 million credit facility expanding the total facility to $650 million. Borrowings under the $650 million credit facility are available at prevailing short term interest rates. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, we had $272.0 million and $259.4 million of debt outstanding under the facility, respectively. A 100 basis point increase/decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt subject to rate variability at December 31, 2010, would result in an incremental increase/decrease in annual interest expense of approximately $3 million. Foreign Exchange Risk Management We have numerous offices in various countries outside North America and conduct operations in various countries through minority equity investments and strategic relationships with local providers. Our International operations generated approximately 25% and 22% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Approximately 45% and 42% of our assets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were located outside of the U.S. Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings, cash flows and financial position of our International operations. We follow a policy of hedging balance sheet positions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries. In addition, we are subject to foreign exchange risk associated with our International earnings and investments. We use short term, foreign exchange forward and option contracts to implement our hedging strategies. These contracts have maturities of twelve months or less. These contracts are denominated primarily in the British pound sterling, the Euro and Canadian dollar. The gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with the balance sheet positions hedge are recorded in Other Income (Expense) Net in our consolidated statement of operations and are essentially offset by the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency transactions. As in prior years, we have hedged substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries with short term forward foreign exchange contracts. In addition, we may use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain foreign earnings 56 and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain net investment positions. The underlying transactions and the corresponding forward exchange and option contracts are marked to market at the end of each quarter and are reflected within our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2010, there were $0.1 million in option contracts outstanding. At December 31, 2009, we did not have any option contracts outstanding. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had a notional amount of approximately $361.1 million and $271.0 million, respectively, of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding that offset foreign currency denominated loans. Realized gains and losses associated with these contracts were $29.3 million and $26.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010; $24.9 million and $13.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009; and $16.2 million and $41.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. Unrealized gains and losses associated with these contracts were $0.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010; $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009; and $0.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. If exchange rates were to increase on average 10% from year end levels, the unrealized loss on our foreign exchange forward contracts would be approximately $17 million, excluding the expected gain on the underlying hedged item. If exchange rates on average were to decrease 10% from year end levels, the unrealized gain on our foreign exchange forward contracts would be approximately $20 million, excluding the expected loss on the underlying hedge item. However, the estimated potential gain and loss on these contracts is expected to be substantially offset by changes in the dollar value of the underlying transactions. Liquidity and Financial Position In connection with our focus on delivering Total Shareholder Return, we will remain disciplined in the use of our shareholders cash, maintaining three key priorities for the use of this cash: First, making ongoing investments in the business to drive growth; Second, investing in acquisitions that we believe will be value accretive to enhance our capabilities and accelerate our growth; and Third, continuing to return cash to shareholders. We believe that cash provided by operating activities, supplemented as needed with available financing arrangements, is sufficient to meet our short term needs (twelve months or less), including restructuring charges, transition costs, our Strategic Technology Investment, contractual obligations and contingencies (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K), excluding the legal matters identified in such note for which exposures cannot be estimated or are not probable. In addition, we believe that our ability to readily access the bank and capital markets for incremental financing needs will enable us to meet our continued focus on Total Shareholder Return. We have the ability to access the short term borrowings market from time to time to fund working capital needs, acquisitions and share repurchases. Such borrowings would be supported by our credit facility, when needed. The disruption in the economic environment has had a significant adverse impact on a number of commercial and financial institutions. Our liquidity has not been impacted by the current credit environment and management does not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. Management continues to closely monitor our liquidity, the credit markets and our financial counterparties. However, management cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment. The following discussions are on a continuing operations basis and therefore exclude the results of the Italian real estate business. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 57 Cash Provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations Net cash provided by operating activities was $319.4 million, $369.5 million and $433.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Year ended December 31, 2010 vs. Year ended December 31, 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $50.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. This decrease was primarily driven by: Increased spend related to our Strategic Technology Investment; and Decreased net income of our underlying business excluding the impact of non cash gains and losses; partially offset by: A decrease in restructuring payments associated with our Financial Flexibility initiatives; and A decrease in net tax payments. Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. Year ended December 31, 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $64.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by: Timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities (e.g., investments, data purchases, etc.); An increase in net tax payments; An increase in restructuring payments associated with our Financial Flexibility initiatives; and Lower collections; partially offset by: Increased net income of our underlying business excluding the impact of non cash gains and losses. Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities from Continuing Operations Net cash used in investing activities was $253.6 million, $120.7 million and $154.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Year ended December 31, 2010 vs. Year ended December 31, 2009 Net cash used in investing activities was $253.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $120.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $132.9 million increase primarily reflects the following activities: During the year ended December 31, 2010, in connection with our initiatives to drive long term growth, we spent $205.0 million on acquisitions and other investments, net of cash acquired, as compared to $74.6 million, net of cash acquired, during the year ended December 31, 2009. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information; and Cash settlements of our foreign currency contracts for our hedged transactions resulted in cash inflows of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to cash inflows of $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. 58 Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. Year ended December 31, 2008 Net cash used in investing activities was $120.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $154.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The $33.8 million decrease primarily reflects the following activities: Cash settlements of our foreign currency contracts for our hedged transactions resulted in cash inflows of $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to cash outflows of $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008; partially offset by: A net increase in additions to computer software and other intangibles and capital expenditures, which was primarily used to fund software development, product and platform enhancements across all three of our solution sets; and During the year ended December 31, 2009, in connection with our initiatives to drive long term growth, we spent $74.6 million on acquisitions/majority owned joint ventures and other investments, net of cash acquired, as compared to $69.2 million, net of cash acquired, during the year ended December 31, 2008. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information. Cash Used in Financing Activities from Continuing Operations Net cash used in financing activities was $192.9 million, $213.1 million and $242.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As set forth below for all these years, these changes primarily relate to contractual obligations, share repurchases and dividends. Contractual Obligations Debt In November 2010, we issued senior notes with a face value of $300 million that mature on November 15, 2015 (the 2015 notes), bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 2.875%, payable semi annually. The proceeds were used in December 2010 to repay our then outstanding $300 million senior notes, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 5.50% which had a maturity date of March 15, 2011 (the 2011 notes). In connection with the redemption of the 2011 notes, we recorded a premium payment of $3.7 million as Other Income (Expense) Net in our consolidated statement of operations. In November and December 2010, we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of $125 million. The objective of these hedges is to offset the change in fair value of the fixed rate 2015 notes attributable to changes in LIBOR. These transactions are accounted for as fair value hedges. We will recognize the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item, in Other Income (Expense) Net in our consolidated statement of operations. In April 2008, we issued notes with a face value of $400 million that mature on April 1, 2013 (the 2013 notes), bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.00%, payable semi annually. The proceeds from this issuance were used to repay indebtedness under our credit facility. On January 30, 2008, we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with an aggregate notional amount of $400 million. The objective of these hedges was to mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in Treasury rates in anticipation of the issuance of the 2013 notes. These transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of the issuance of the 2013 notes were recorded in AOCI. In connection with the issuance of the 2013 notes, these interest rate derivative transactions were terminated, resulting in a loss and a payment of $8.5 million at the date of termination. The payments are recorded in AOCI, and are being amortized over the life of the 2013 notes. 59 Credit Facility At December 31, 2007, we had a $500 million, five year bank revolving credit facility, which expires in April 2012. Borrowings under the $500 million credit facility are available at prevailing short term interest rates. On January 25, 2008, we exercised a $150 million expansion feature on our $500 million credit facility expanding the total facility to $650 million. We had $272.0 million, $259.4 million and $203.4 million of borrowings outstanding under the $650 million credit facility at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We borrowed under these facilities from time to time during the year ended December 31, 2010 to fund our share repurchases, acquisition strategy and working capital needs. Share Repurchases During the year ended December 31, 2010, we repurchased 1,792,107 shares of common stock for $134.8 million under our share repurchase programs. The share repurchases are comprised of the following programs: In February 2009, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million share repurchase program. We repurchased 1,108,148 shares of common stock for $81.0 million under this share repurchase program during the year ended December 31, 2010. We anticipate that this program will be completed by December 2011; In May 2010, our Board of Directors approved a four year, five million share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of shares issued under our stock incentive plans and Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP). During the year ended December 31, 2010, we repurchased 26,621 shares of common stock for $2.0 million under this repurchase program. This program commenced in October 2010 and expires in October 2014; and In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a four year, five million share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of the shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. We repurchased 657,338 shares of common stock for $51.8 million under this program during the year ended December 31, 2010. This program expired in August 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased 2,912,200 shares of common stock for $225.6 million under our share repurchase programs. The share repurchases are comprised of the following programs: In February 2009, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million share repurchase program which commenced in December 2009. We repurchased 278,417 shares of common stock for $22.7 million under this share repurchase program during the year ended December 31, 2009. We anticipate that this program will be completed by December 2011; In December 2007, our Board of Directors approved a $400 million, two year share repurchase program which commenced in February 2008. We repurchased 1,662,245 shares of common stock for $127.3 million under this share repurchase program during the year ended December 31, 2009. This program was completed in December 2009; and In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a four year, five million share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of the shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. We repurchased 971,538 shares of common stock for $75.6 million under this program during the year ended December 31, 2009. This program expired in August 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased 4,416,195 shares of common stock for $381.9 million under our share repurchase programs. The share repurchases are comprised of the following programs: In December 2007, our Board of Directors approved a $400 million, two year share repurchase program, which commenced in February 2008. We repurchased 3,174,402 shares of common stock for $272.7 million under this share repurchase program during the year ended December 31, 2008; 60 In May 2007, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million, one year share repurchase program, which commenced in July 2007. We repurchased 309,971 shares of common stock for $26.8 million under this repurchase program during the year ended December 31, 2008. This program was completed in February 2008; and In August 2006, our Board of Directors approved a four year, five million share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of the shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. We repurchased 931,822 shares of common stock for $82.4 million under this program during the year ended December 31, 2008. This program expired in August 2010. Dividends The total amount of dividends paid during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $70.0 million, $71.5 million and $65.6 million, respectively. Future Liquidity Sources and Uses of Funds Contractual Cash Obligations The following table quantifies, as of December 31, 2010, our contractual obligations that will require the use of cash in the future. Contractual Obligations(a) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter All Other (Amounts in millions) Long Term Debt(1) $ 1,071.0 $ 35.4 $ 305.8 $ 415.1 $ 9.0 $ 305.2 $ 0.5 $ Operating Leases(2) $ 128.2 $ 30.3 $ 24.1 $ 17.1 $ 12.7 $ 12.1 $ 31.9 $ Obligations to Outsourcers(3) $ 432.7 $ 113.0 $ 96.5 $ 80.9 $ 73.0 $ 46.1 $ 23.2 $ Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Payments/Contributions(4) $ 772.7 $ 45.0 $ 34.0 $ 32.5 $ 33.0 $ 30.4 $ 597.8 $ Spin off Obligation(5) $ 23.0 $ 23.0 $ $ $ $ $ $ Unrecognized Tax Benefits(6) $ 147.2 $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 147.2 (a) Because their future cash flows are uncertain, other noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the table. (1) Primarily represents: i) our senior notes with a face value of $400 million that mature in April 2013, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.00%, payable semi annually; ii) our senior notes with a face value of $300 million that mature in November 2015, net of a fair value adjustment and discount of $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 2.875%, payable semi annually; and iii) borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facility at short term interest rates. Amounts include the interest portion on future obligations. The interest rate on our senior notes is presented using the stated interest rate. Interest expense on our bank credit facility is estimated using the rate in effect as of December 31, 2010. (2) Most of our operations are conducted from leased facilities, which are under operating leases that expire over the next ten years, with the majority expiring within five years. We also lease certain computer and other equipment under operating leases that expire over the next three and five years, respectively. These computer and other equipment leases are frequently renegotiated or otherwise changed as advancements in computer technology produce opportunities to lower costs and improve performance. (3) Computer Sciences Corporation In July 2002, we outsourced certain technology functions to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) under a ten year agreement, which we had the right to terminate for a fee at any time and under certain other conditions. Under the terms of the agreement, CSCs responsibilities included data center operations, technology help desk and network management functions in the U.S. and UK as well as certain application 61 development and maintenance functions. This agreement was amended in March 2008, which, among other things, increased certain services level agreements that CSC was required to provide under the Technology Services Agreement and added additional security services to be performed by CSC. In August 2009, we entered into a wind down agreement with CSC and Acxiom Corporation (Acxiom) which terminated all of the data center operations functions provided by CSC, effective September 2009. In September 2009, we entered into a new agreement with CSC for limited print and fulfillment services that remained with CSC. In June 2010, we terminated the print and fulfillment services provided by CSC. In November 2010, we notified CSC of our decision to terminate by March 2011 an agreement in which CSC provided support and services for internal applications. With the termination of this agreement, the only service that will be provided by CSC is limited production support services. We incurred costs of approximately $9 million, $51 million and $78 million under this contract for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. ICT Group, Inc./Sykes Enterprises, Inc. In December 2003, we signed a three year agreement with ICT Group, Inc. (ICT), effective January 2004, to outsource certain marketing call center activities, which agreement contains two renewal options for up to a one year period. The agreement was amended effective September 2007 to be extended through 2011. In February 2010, ICT was acquired by Sykes Enterprises, Inc. (Sykes) in which the terms of our agreement remained unchanged. Under the terms of the agreement, Sykes is responsible for performing certain marketing and credit calling activities previously performed by our own call centers in North America. The obligation under the contract is based upon transmitted call volumes, but shall not be less than $3 million per contract year. We incurred costs of approximately $8 million under this contract for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. International Business Machines In October 2004, we signed a seven year outsourcing agreement with International Business Machines (IBM). Under the terms of the agreement, we have transitioned certain portions of our data acquisition and delivery and customer service to IBM. By August 2010, our data acquisition and delivery and customer services performed by IBM for our European countries were terminated. We incurred costs of approximately $19 million, $26 million and $30 million under this contract for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Acxiom Corporation In July 2006, we signed a four year product and technology outsourcing agreement with Acxiom in order to significantly increase the speed, data processing capacity and matching capabilities we provide our global sales and marketing customers. In November 2008, we extended the term of the outsourcing agreement through 2011. In November 2008, we entered into an agreement that will expand our service capabilities, enhance customer experience and accelerate the migration of the remaining existing D&B fulfillment processes to Acxiom. In May 2009, and as part of our ongoing Financial Flexibility initiatives, we entered into another agreement with Acxiom to provide certain infrastructure management services that were formerly provided by CSC. These services include data center operations, technology help desk and network management functions. The agreement originally had an initial term ending in October 2014 and included the right to extend the agreement under the same terms for up to a maximum period of three years after the expiration of the original term. In 2010, we entered into two amendments with Acxiom extending the initial term of the agreement by a total of eight months until June 2015. We retain the right to extend the agreement for up to three years after the expiration of this amended term. Payments to Acxiom over the amended initial contract term based on contract volumes will aggregate to approximately $320 million. The agreement provides for typical adjustments due to changes in volume, inflation and incremental project work. Payments made for the provision of such services in 2010 did not differ materially from payments that were expected to be made under our prior arrangement with CSC. However, we anticipate savings to be generated over the life of the contract. 62 In December 2009, we signed a three year data maintenance and support agreement with Acxiom. Payments over the contract term will aggregate approximately $5 million. The agreement provides for typical adjustments due to changes in volume, inflation and incremental project work. Additionally, in 2010, we engaged Acxiom to provide services related to our Strategic Technology Investment totaling approximately $6 million in the year. We incurred costs of approximately $93 million, $43 million, and $8 million under all of these agreements for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Total payments to Acxiom over the remaining terms of the above contracts will aggregate to approximately $239 million. Convergys Customer Management Group In December 2010, we entered into a six year business process outsourcing agreement effective January 1, 2011, with Convergys Customer Management Group (CCMG) in order to enhance our customer contact center solution. CCMG will be transitioning contact center services previously outsourced principally to IBM as well as certain other smaller providers. The transition of services to CCMG is based on a phased migration of business volume to CCMG commencing in the second quarter of 2011 and will be substantially completed during 2011. Services will be primarily provided from CCMG locations in Omaha, Nebraska, the Philippines and India, on the basis of our requirements. The primary scope of the agreement includes the following services for our North America business: (i) Inbound Customer Service, which principally involves the receipt of, response to, and resolution of inquiries received from customers; (ii) Outbound Customer Service, which principally involves the collection, compilation and verification of information contained in our databases; and (iii) Data Update Service, which principally involves the bulk or discrete updates to the critical data elements about companies in our databases. The agreement also specifies service level commitments required of Convergys for achievement of our customer satisfaction targets and a methodology for calculating credits to us if Convergys fails to meet certain service levels. In addition, Convergyss performance under the agreement will be measured in part by our overall satisfaction of the program as measured by a customer satisfaction survey of our key internal business partners. Aggregate expenditures during the six year term of the agreement are expected to be approximately $135 million. After the first three years of service by Convergys, we have the right to terminate for convenience any or all of the services provided under the agreement upon one hundred eighty days prior written notice, and without incurring a termination fee. (4) Represents projected contributions to our non U.S. defined benefit plans as well as projected benefit payments related to our unfunded plans, including the U.S. Non Qualified Plans and our postretirement benefit plan. We do not expect to make any contributions to our U.S. Qualified Plan. The expected benefits are estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure our benefit obligation at the end of 2009 and include benefits attributable to estimated future employee service. A closed group approach is used in calculating the projected benefit payments, assuming only the participants who are currently in the valuation population are included in the projection and the projected benefits continue for up to approximately 99 years. (5) In 2000, Moodys Corporation (Moodys) and D&B entered into a Tax Allocation Agreement (TAA) as part of a spin off transaction under which Moodys and D&B became independent of one another. See Note 13 in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for more information about the spin off. Under the TAA, Moodys and D&B agreed that Moodys would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with the exercise of Moodys stock options (including Moodys stock options exercised by D&B employees) and D&B would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with the exercise of D&B stock options (including D&B stock options exercised by employees of Moodys). Put simply, the tax 63 deduction would go to the company that granted the stock options, rather than to the employer of the individual exercising the stock options. In 2002 and 2003, the IRS issued rulings that clarified that, under the circumstances applicable to Moodys and D&B, the compensation expense deduction belongs to the employer of the option grantee and not to the issuer of the option (e.g., D&B would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with D&B employees exercising Moodys options and Moodys would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with Moodys employees exercising D&B options). We have filed tax returns for 2001 through 2009, and made estimated tax deposits for 2010, consistent with the IRS rulings. We may be required to reimburse Moodys for the loss of compensation expense deductions relating to tax years 2006 to 2010 of approximately $23.0 million in the aggregate for such years. In 2005 and 2006, we paid Moodys approximately $30.1 million, which represented the incremental increase in tax benefits realized by D&B for tax years 2003 2005 from using the filing method consistent with the IRS rulings. We did not make any further payments to Moodys since the first quarter of 2006 with respect to this issue. In a letter dated September 10, 2010, Moodys asserted that D&B owed Moodys an additional amount of approximately $2.8 million, plus interest, as a result of the parties use of the filing method consistent with the IRS rulings for 2003 2005. In November 2010, Moodys and D&B agreed to settle the dispute for a further payment to Moodys of $2.5 million, which we paid in February 2011. While not material, we may also be required to pay, in the future, amounts in addition to the approximately $23.0 million referenced above based upon interpretations by the parties of the TAA and the IRS rulings. (6) We have a total amount of unrecognized tax benefits of $150.7 million for the year ending December 31, 2010. Although we do not anticipate payments within the next twelve months for these matters, these could require the aggregate use of cash totaling approximately $147.2 million. As we cannot make reliable estimates regarding the timing of the cash flows by period, we have included unrecognized tax benefits within the All Other column in the table above. Capital Structure Every year we examine our capital structure and review our plans. During 2011, in connection with our focus on our Total Shareholder Return, we anticipate continued share repurchases and cash dividends. We believe that cash provided by operating activities, supplemented as needed with readily available financing arrangements, is sufficient to meet our short term needs, including the cash cost of restructuring charges, transition costs, our Strategic Technology Investment, contractual obligations and contingencies, excluding the legal matters identified herein for which exposures cannot be estimated. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. As we execute our long term strategy, which contemplates strategic acquisitions, we may require or consider additional financing. We regularly evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile and various financing alternatives for opportunities to enhance our capital structure. While we feel confident that such financing arrangements are available to us, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to access new sources of liquidity when required. The disruption in the economic environment has had a significant adverse impact on a number of commercial and financial institutions. Our liquidity has not been impacted by the current credit environment and management does not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. Management continues to closely monitor our liquidity, the credit markets and our financial counterparties. However, management cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment. Share Repurchases and Dividends In February 2009, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million share repurchase program which commenced in December 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we repurchased 1,108,148 shares of 64 common stock for $81.0 million under this share repurchase program with $96.3 million remaining under this program. We anticipate that this program will be completed by December 2011. In May 2010, our Board of Directors approved a four year, five million share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of shares issued under our stock incentive plans and ESPP. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we repurchased 26,621 shares of common stock for $2.0 million under this repurchase program with 4,973,379 shares of common stock remaining under this program. This program commenced in October 2010 and expires in October 2014. On February 2, 2011, we declared a dividend of $0.36 per share for the first quarter of 2011. This cash dividend will be payable on March 16, 2011 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2011. Strategic Technology Investment Program In February 2010, we announced a Strategic Technology Investment program aimed at strengthening our leading position in commercial data and improving our current technology platform to meet the emerging needs of customers. We expect the Strategic Technology Investment to be completed during the second half of 2012 and the total cost to be closer to the higher end of our previously disclosed range of approximately $110 million to $130 million, with approximately $55 million to $65 million of spend occurring in 2011. Potential Payments in Legal Matters We and our predecessors are involved in certain legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. These matters are at various stages of resolution, but could ultimately result in significant cash payments as described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We believe we have adequate reserves recorded in our consolidated financial statements for our share of current exposures in these matters, where applicable, as described therein. Legacy Tax Refund We expect to receive approximately $9.6 million in the first quarter of 2011 relating to a Legacy Tax Refund for the 2001 and 2002 tax years. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further detail. Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefit Plan Contribution Requirements For financial statement reporting purposes, the funded status of our pension plans, as determined in accordance with GAAP, had a deficit of $133.2 million, $252.2 million and $45.8 million for the U.S. Qualified Plan, the U.S. Non Qualified Plans and the non U.S. plans, respectively, at December 31, 2010, as compared to a deficit of $121.5 million, $257.0 million and $72.3 million at December 31, 2009. The deterioration in the funded status of the U.S. Qualified Plan was primarily due to a higher projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2010 which was driven by a lower discount rate and negative plan amendment. The improvement in the funded status of the U.S. Non Qualified Plans was primarily due to higher lump sum benefit payments in 2010. The improvement in the funded status of the non U.S. plans was primarily due to lower projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2010, as result of positive impact from statutory inflation assumption change as well as better than assumed experience. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. During fiscal 2010, we were not required to make contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan, the largest of our six plans, under funding regulations associated with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA 2006) as the plan 65 was considered fully funded for the 2009 plan year. We do not expect to make any contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan in fiscal 2011 for the 2010 plan year. Final funding requirements for fiscal 2011 were determined based on our January 2011 funding actuarial valuation. We expect to continue to make cash contributions to our other pension plans during 2011. The expected 2011 contribution is approximately $39 million, compared to $40.6 million in 2010. In addition, we expect to make benefit payments related to our postretirement benefit plan of approximately $6 million during 2011, compared to $7.0 million in 2010. See the Contractual Cash Obligations table above for projected contributions and benefit payments beyond 2010. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Related Party Transactions We do not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off balance sheet arrangements except for those disclosed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Additionally, we have not engaged in any significant related party transactions. Fair Value Measurements Our non recurring non financial assets and liabilities include long lived assets held and used, goodwill and intangible assets. These assets are recognized at fair value when they are deemed to be impaired. During the second quarter of 2010, we recorded an impairment charge of $6.8 million of intangible assets related to database, technology, tradename and customer relationships related to the Quality Education Data (QED) acquisition as a result of an examination of such assets initiated in connection with a recent settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. We determined the new cost basis of these intangible assets based on internally developed cash flow projections (Level III inputs) to measure fair value, as market data of these assets are not readily available. The impairment charge is included in Operating Costs in our North American segment. During the third quarter of 2010, we recorded a $13.6 million impairment charge related to software and intangible assets of our Purisma product, resulting from our decision to restructure this business. After analyzing various options, we decided to focus on providing maintenance and customer support to our existing customer base. We determined the new cost basis of these assets is zero based on internally developed cash flow projections (Level III inputs) to measure fair value, as market data of these assets are not readily available. The impairment charge is included in Operating Costs in our North American segment. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an impairment charge of $3.0 million related to certain intangible assets related to the Visible Path acquisition. We determined that the new cost basis of certain intangible assets related to the Visible Path acquisition is zero based on Level III inputs. The impairment charge is included in Operating Costs in our North American segment. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further detail on our impaired long lived assets. As of December 31, 2010, we did not have any unobservable (Level III) inputs in determining fair value for our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis other than our real estate funds. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further detail. Forward Looking Statements We may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 66 as amended, including statements contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in reports to shareholders and in press releases and investor Web casts.

The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements: We rely significantly on third parties to support critical components of our business model in a continuous and high quality manner, including third party data providers, strategic third party members in our D&B Worldwide Network, and third parties with whom we have significant outsourcing arrangements; Our ability to implement and derive the benefit of our Strategic Technology Investment program announced in February 2010 and to maintain sufficient investment in our technology infrastructure thereafter; Demand for our products is subject to intense competition, changes in customer preferences and economic conditions which impact customer behavior; Our solutions and brand image are dependent upon the integrity and security of our global database and the continued availability thereof through the internet and by other means, as well as our ability to protect key assets, such as our data centers; Our ability to maintain the integrity of our brand and reputation, which we believe are key assets and competitive advantages; Our ability to renew large contracts, the related revenue recognition and the timing thereof, or a shift in product mix, may impact our results of operations from period to period; As a result of the macro economic challenges currently affecting the global economy, our customers or vendors may experience cash flow problems. This may cause our customers to delay, cancel or significantly decrease their purchases from us and impact their ability to pay amounts owed to us. In addition, our vendors may substantially increase their prices without notice. Such behavior may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. In addition, if economic conditions in the United States and other key markets deteriorate further or do not show improvement, we may experience material adverse impacts to our business, operating results, and or access to credit markets; Our results are subject to the effects of foreign economies, exchange rate fluctuations, legislative or regulatory requirements, such as the adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices, including pronouncements by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies, and the implementation or modification of fees or taxes that we must pay to acquire, use, and or redistribute data. Future laws or regulations with respect to the collection, compilation, use and/ or publication of information and adverse publicity or litigation concerning the commercial use of such information, or changes in the rules governing the operation of the Internet could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results; 67 Our ability to introduce new solutions or services having more breadth and depth of data which allow customers more flexible use of D&B data through web services and third party solutions, in a seamless way and without disruption to existing solutions such as DNBi; Our ability to acquire and successfully integrate other complementary businesses, products and technologies into our existing business, without significant disruption to our existing business or to our financial results; The continued adherence by third party members of our D&B Worldwide Network or other third parties who license and sell under the D&B name to our quality standards, our brand and communication standards and to the terms and conditions of our commercial services arrangements; Our future success requires that we attract and retain qualified personnel, including members of our sales force and technology teams, in regions throughout the world; The profitability of our International segment depends on our ability to identify and execute on various initiatives, such as the continued implementation of subscription plan pricing, such as DNBi, and successfully managing our D&B Worldwide Network, and our ability to identify and contend with various challenges present in foreign markets, such as local competition and the availability of public records at no cost, or the adoption of new laws or regulations governing the collection, compilation, use and/ or publication of information, particularly in emerging markets; Our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy requires that we successfully reduce our expense base through our Financial Flexibility initiatives, and reallocate certain of the expense base reductions into initiatives that produce desired revenue growth; We are involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are unknown and uncertain with respect to the impact on our cash flow and profitability; Our ability to repurchase shares is subject to market conditions, including trading volume in our stock, and our ability to repurchase shares in accordance with applicable securities laws; and Our projection for free cash flow is dependent upon our ability to generate revenue, our collection processes, customer payment patterns, the timing and volume of stock option exercises and the amount and timing of payments related to the tax and other matters and legal proceedings in which we are involved. We elaborate on the above list of important factors throughout this document and in our other filings with the SEC, particularly in the discussion of our Risk Factors in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. It should be understood that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, the above list of important factors and the Risk Factors discussed in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10 K should not be considered to be a complete discussion of all of our potential trends, risks and uncertainties. Except as otherwise required by federal securities laws, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement we may make from time to time. Item 7A.
