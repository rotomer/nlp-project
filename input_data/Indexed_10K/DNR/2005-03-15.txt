ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We are a growing independent oil and gas company engaged in acquisition, development and exploration activities in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. We are the largest oil and natural gas producer in Mississippi, own the largest reserves of carbon dioxide ("CO2") used for tertiary oil recovery east of the Mississippi River, and hold significant operating acreage onshore Louisiana and in the Barnett Shale play in Texas. Our goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling, and proven engineering extraction processes, including secondary and tertiary recovery operations. Our corporate headquarters are in Plano, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), and we have two primary field offices located in Houma, Louisiana, and Laurel, Mississippi. OVERVIEW CONTINUED EXPANSION OF OUR TERTIARY OPERATIONS. Since we acquired our first carbon dioxide tertiary flood in Mississippi over five years ago, we have gradually increased our emphasis on these types of operations. We particularly like this play because of its risk profile, rate of return and lack of competition in our operating area. Generally, from East Texas to Florida, there are no known significant natural sources of carbon dioxide except our own, and these large volumes of CO2 that we own drive the play. Please refer to the section entitled "CO2 Operations" for further information regarding these operations, their potential, and the ramifications of this change in focus. During the last few years, we have gradually increased the percentage of our spending dedicated to CO2 and tertiary related operations. During 2002 and 2003, we spent around 25% of our capital budget on tertiary related items, spent approximately 46% during 2004, and we further emphasized this part of our business by budgeting over 60% of our initial 2005 capital budget for tertiary operations. We plan to spend approximately $190 million during 2005 on tertiary operations, including an estimated $45 million for an 84 mile pipeline to transport CO2 from our CO2 source fields located near Jackson, Mississippi to our planned tertiary recovery operations in East Mississippi, an expenditure that may ultimately be financed with sources other than our cash flow. We anticipate that the pipeline will be ready for use during the first half of 2006 to commence what we call Phase II (operations in East Mississippi) of our tertiary recovery program (see "CO2 Operations"). Phase II will initially consist of tertiary recovery operations at six oil fields in that region, but we ultimately plan to expand these operations to several other oil fields in the area, which would also be serviced by the new pipeline. Our focus on CO2 tertiary related operations is expected to impact our financial results and certain operating statistics. See "Results of Operations CO2 Operations Financial Statement Impact of CO2 Operations" below. During 2004, we drilled four CO2 wells which added an estimated 1.0 Tcf of proved CO2 reserves, resulting in total proved CO2 reserves at December 31, 2004 of approximately 2.7 Tcf (2.1 Tcf to our net ownership see "CO2 Operations CO2 Resources"). We anticipate that year end 2004 proved CO2 reserves will be sufficient to satisfy the projected CO2 requirements for our first two tertiary operation phases, Phase I, our tertiary operations in Southwest Mississippi, and Phase II, our recently planned expansion into Eastern Mississippi. Following the sale of our offshore operations in July 2004, we updated our development schedule and targeted oil production from these tertiary recovery operations. Based on our current plans, we anticipate that we can continue to show significant growth in our oil production from tertiary operations for the next five to ten years from our planned Phase I and Phase II operations. The model assumes that the first production from tertiary recovery operations in Eastern Mississippi will occur in 2007. During 2004, oil production from our tertiary recovery operations averaged 6,784 BOE/d, averaging 7,242 BOE/d during the fourth quarter. SALE OF OFFSHORE OPERATIONS. On July 20, 2004, we closed the sale of Denbury Offshore, Inc., a subsidiary that held our offshore assets, for $200 million (before adjustments) to Newfield Exploration Company. The sale price was based on the asset value of the offshore assets as of April 1, 2004, which means that the net operating cash flow (defined as revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures) from these properties which we received between April 1st and closing, as well as expenses of the sale and other contractual adjustments, reduced the purchase price to approximately $187 million. The purchaser also received the net working capital of Denbury Offshore as of the closing date, which primarily consisted of accrued production receivables. 26 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We excluded two significant items from the sale: (i) a discovery well drilled at High Island A 6 during 2004 and (ii) certain deep rights at West Delta 27. The well at High Island A 6 should be on production during the first half of 2005, and we sold a substantial portion of the deep rights at West Delta 27 during the third quarter of 2004 for $1.8 million but retained a carried interest in a deep exploratory well. Our offshore properties made up approximately 12% of our year end 2003 proved reserves (approximately 96 Bcfe as of December 31, 2003) and represented approximately 25% (9,114 BOE/d) of our 2004 second quarter production. OPERATING RESULTS. As a result of the sale of our offshore properties early in the third quarter of 2004, our total production was significantly reduced, contributing to a 5% decline in production levels during 2004 as compared to 2003 levels. However, higher commodity prices more than offset the lower production, resulting in net income of $82.4 million during 2004 as compared to $56.6 million of net income during 2003. The increase in adjusted cash flow from operations during 2004 was less significant (5%) primarily due to the $21.0 million of income taxes paid relating to the sale of our offshore properties. See "Results of Operations Operating Income" for discussion of this non GAAP measure versus cash flow from operations, which decreased by 15% between the two periods. Payments on our commodity hedges continued to be a significant outflow, totaling $84.6 million for 2004, up from $62.2 million during 2003. Hedge payments should drop significantly during 2005 as most of our out of the money hedges expired at December 31, 2004. See "Results of Operations" for a more thorough discussion of our operating results and "Market Risk Management" for more information regarding our hedge position at year end 2004 and our new method of accounting for hedges for 2005. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY For 2005, our initial capital budget, excluding any potential acquisitions, is $305 million, which at commodity futures prices as of the end of February 2005 will be slightly more than anticipated cash flow from operations. That budget includes an estimated $45 million for a CO2 pipeline being constructed to East Mississippi (see "Expansion of our tertiary operations" under "Overview" above), which we may refinance upon completion by entering into some sort of long term financing, effectively paying for the cost of the pipeline over time and recouping the cash spent. We monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis, adjusting them up or down depending on commodity prices and the resultant cash flow. Therefore, during the last few years as commodity prices have increased, we have often increased our capital budget during the year and would likely do so again if commodity prices remain strong or increase further. At year end 2004, we had approximately $70 million in cash and short term investments remaining from the sale of our offshore properties, over and above our normal month end cash balances. We plan to invest this remaining cash and any cash potentially generated from operations in excess of our capital budget (such amount being highly dependent on commodity prices) over the next one to two years on property acquisitions, particularly those that have future tertiary potential. Although we now control most of the fields along our existing CO2 pipeline, there are several fields in East Mississippi that could be acquired to expand our planned tertiary operations there, plus we are continuing to seek additional interests in the fields that we currently own. Further, we would like to add additional phases or areas of tertiary operations by acquiring other old oil fields in other parts of our region of operations, building a CO2 pipeline to those areas and initiating additional tertiary floods. We accelerated the pace and expenditures on our tertiary operations following the offshore sale, and plan to continue to do so as long as it remains economic and practical. We also may seek conventional development and exploration projects in our areas of operations or tertiary operations in other areas of the country. In addition to our cash and short term investments which may be used for the potential aforementioned projects, we have all of our bank credit line available to us if we were to need additional capital. At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding $225 million (principal amount) of 7.5% subordinated notes due in 2013, approximately $4 million of capital lease commitments, no bank debt, and working capital of $90 million. On September 1, 2004, we amended and restated our bank credit agreement which modified the prior agreement by (i) creating a structure wherein the commitment amount and borrowing base amount are no longer the same, (ii) improving our credit pricing by reducing the interest rate chargeable at certain levels of borrowing, (iii) extending the term by three years to April 30, 2009, (iv) reducing the collateral requirements, (v) authorizing up to $20 million of possible future CO2 volumetric production payment transactions with Genesis Energy ($4.8 million of such transactions occurred in October 2004), and (vi) other minor modifications and corrections. Under the new agreement, our borrowing base was initially set at $200 million, a $25 million increase over the prior borrowing base of $175 million, with an initial commitment amount of $100 million. The borrowing base represents the amount we can borrow from a credit standpoint based on our assets, as confirmed by the banks, while the commitment amount is the amount we have asked the banks to commit to fund pursuant to the terms of 27 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations the credit agreement. The banks have the option to participate in any borrowing request made by us in excess of the commitment amount, up to the borrowing base limit, although they are not obligated to fund any amount in excess of $100 million, the commitment amount. The advantage to us is that we will pay commitment fees on the lower commitment amount, not the higher borrowing base, thus lowering our overall cost of available credit. Sources and Uses of Capital Resources During 2004, we spent $167.0 million on oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditures, $42.4 million on CO2 exploration and development expenditures, and approximately $18.9 million on property acquisitions, for total capital expenditures of approximately $228.3 million. Our exploration and development expenditures included approximately $138.9 million spent on drilling, $18.9 million of geological, geophysical and acreage expenditures and $51.6 million spent on facilities and recompletion costs. We funded these expenditures with $168.7 million of cash flow from operations, with the balance funded with net proceeds from the sale of our offshore properties. We paid back all of our bank debt during the third quarter of 2004 with the offshore sale proceeds, leaving us with approximately $33.0 million of cash and $57.2 million of short term investments as of December 31, 2004. We also raised $4.8 million during the third quarter of 2004 from the sale of another volumetric production payment of CO2 to Genesis Energy, L.P. ("Genesis"), along with a related long term CO2 supply agreement with an industrial customer. Adjusted cash flow from operations (a non GAAP measure defined as cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities as discussed below under "Results of Operations Operating Results") was $200.2 million for 2004, while cash flow from operations, the GAAP measure, was $168.7 million. During 2003, we generated approximately $197.6 million of cash flow from operations and generated an additional $29.4 million of cash from sales of oil and gas properties. The largest single asset sale was the sale of Laurel Field, acquired from COHO in August 2002, which netted us approximately $25.9 million. Later in the year, we also sold a volumetric production payment to Genesis, which netted us approximately $23.9 million of cash. During 2003, we spent $146.6 million on oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditures, $22.7 million on CO2 capital investments and acquisitions, and approximately $11.8 million on oil and natural gas property acquisitions, for total capital expenditures of approximately $181.1 million. Our exploration and development expenditures included approximately $115.3 million spent on drilling, $15.7 million of geological, geophysical and acreage expenditures and $35.2 million spent on facilities and recompletion costs. In addition, during 2003 we incurred approximately $15.6 million of costs for our subordinated debt refinancing. The $147.3 million of net total expenditures (including the $15.6 million of debt refinancing costs but net of property sales proceeds) was funded by our cash flow from operations, with the balance used to reduce our total debt by approximately $50.0 million. During 2002, we spent approximately $99.3 million on exploration and development activities, approximately $56.4 million on acquisitions (the largest being the $48.2 million acquisition of the COHO properties), and approximately $16.4 million on CO2 related capital expenditures, for a total of approximately $172.1 million. Our exploration and development expenditures included approximately $62.3 million spent on drilling, $17.8 million of geological, geophysical and acreage expenditures and $19.1 million spent on facilities and recompletion costs. The exploration and development expenditures were funded by cash flow from operations, and the acquisitions were primarily funded by cash flow, supplemented by property dispositions totaling $7.7 million and incremental bank debt for the year of $9.1 million. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Commitments and Obligations We have no off balance sheet arrangements, special purpose entities, financing partnerships or guarantees, other than as disclosed in this section. We have no debt or equity triggers based upon our stock or commodity prices. Our dollar denominated obligations that are not on our balance sheet include our operating leases, which at year end 2004 totaled $21.6 million relating primarily to the lease financing of certain equipment for our CO2 recycling facilities at our tertiary oil fields. We also have several leases relating to office space and other minor equipment leases. We also have dollar related 28 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations obligations that are not currently recorded on our balance sheet relating to various obligations for development and exploratory expenditures that arise from our normal capital expenditure program or from other transactions common to our industry. In addition, in order to recover our undeveloped proved reserves, we must also fund the associated future development costs forecasted in our proved reserve reports. For a further discussion of our future development costs and proved reserves, see "Results of Operations Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization." At December 31, 2004, we had a total of $460,000 outstanding in letters of credit. Genesis Energy, Inc., our 100% owned subsidiary which is the general partner of Genesis, has guaranteed the bank debt of Genesis, which consists of $15.3 million of debt and $22.8 million in letters of credit at December 31, 2004. There were no guarantees by Denbury or any of its other subsidiaries of the debt of Genesis or of Genesis Energy, Inc. at December 31, 2004. We do not have any material transactions with related parties other than sales of production and transportation arrangements with Genesis made in the ordinary course of business, and volumetric production payments of CO2 ("VPP") sold to Genesis as discussed in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. A summary of our obligations is presented in the following table: Payments Due by Period Amounts in Thousands Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Subordinated debt (a)................. $ 225,000 $ $ $ $ $ $ 225,000 Estimated interest payments on Subordinated debt................... 143,438 16,875 16,875 16,875 16,875 16,875 59,063 Operating lease obligations........... 21,582 3,977 3,967 3,954 3,807 3,064 2,813 Capital lease obligations (b)......... 6,807 806 806 806 806 806 2,777 Capital expenditure obligations (c)... 23,752 23,752 Other long term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet: Derivative liabilities (d) ......... 4,196 4,196 Other Cash Commitments: Future development costs on proved reserves, net of capital obligations (e) 320,988 110,491 84,686 48,809 36,313 14,629 26,060 Asset retirement obligations (f)..... 52,073 2,197 3,016 958 1,593 398 43,911 Total............................... $ 797,836 $ 162,294 $109,350 $ 71,402 $ 59,394 $ 35,772 $ 359,624 (a) These long term borrowings and related interest payments are further discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table assumes that our long term debt is held until maturity. (b) Represents future minimum cash commitments under capital leases in place at December 31, 2004, primarily for transportation of crude oil and CO2. Agreements are with Genesis. Approximately $2.2 million of these payments represents interest. (c) Represents future minimum cash commitments under contracts in place as of December 31, 2004, primarily for drilling rig services and well related costs. As is common in our industry, we commit to make certain expenditures on a regular basis as part of our ongoing development and exploration program. These commitments generally relate to projects that occur during the subsequent several months and are usually part of our normal operating expenses or part of our capital budget, which for 2005 is currently set at $305 million (including the CO2 pipeline). In addition, we have recurring expenditures for such things as accounting, engineering and legal fees, software maintenance, subscriptions, and other overhead type items. Normally these expenditures do not change materially on an aggregate basis from year to year and are part of our general and administrative expenses. We have not attempted to estimate these types of expenditures in this table as most could be quickly cancelled with regard to any specific vendor, even though the expense itself may be required for ongoing normal operations of the Company. (d) Represents the estimated future payments under our derivative obligations based on the futures market prices as of December 31, 2004. These amounts will change as oil and natural gas commodity prices change. The estimated fair market value of our oil and natural gas commodity derivatives at December 31, 2004 was a $4.9 million liability. See further discussion of our derivative contracts in "Market Risk Management" contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (e) Represents projected capital costs as scheduled in our December 31, 2004 proved reserve report that are necessary in order to recover our proved undeveloped reserves, but these are not current contractual commitments. Amount is net of capital obligations shown above. 29 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (f) Represents the estimated future asset retirement obligations on an undiscounted basis. The discounted asset retirement obligation of $21.5 million, as determined under SFAS No. 143, is further discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long term contracts require us to deliver CO2 to our industrial CO2 customers at various contracted prices, plus we have a CO2 delivery obligation to Genesis pursuant to two volumetric production payments ("VPP") contracts entered into during 2003 and 2004. Based upon the maximum amounts deliverable as stated in the contracts and the volumetric production payment, we estimate that we may be obligated to deliver up to 398 Bcf of CO2 to these customers over the next 17 years; however, since the group as a whole has historically taken less CO2 than the maximum allowed in their contracts, based on the current level of deliveries we project that our commitment would likely be reduced to approximately 332 Bcf. The maximum volume required in any given year is approximately 101 MMcf/d, although based on our current level of deliveries; this would likely be reduced to approximately 78 MMcf/d. Given the size of our proven CO2 reserves at December 31, 2004 (approximately 2.7 Tcf before deducting approximately 178.7 Bcf for the two VPPs), our current production capabilities and our projected levels of CO2 usage for our own tertiary flooding program, we believe that we will be able to meet these delivery obligations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CO2 Operations OVERVIEW. Over five years ago we began our focus upon tertiary operations with the purchase of Little Creek Field, a tertiary recovery operation that was already underway. Subsequently, we have greatly expanded this program in Southwest Mississippi (Phase I of our tertiary operations), acquiring several more oil fields and most importantly the CO2 resources used to flood these fields (see "CO2 Resources" below). The focus has increased to the point that approximately 60% of our 2005 capital budget is dedicated to tertiary related operations, including the CO2 pipeline currently under construction to East Mississippi (the area where we will conduct Phase II of our tertiary operations). We particularly like this play as (i) it is lower risk and more predictable than most traditional exploration and development activities, (ii) it provides a reasonable rate of return at relatively low oil prices (down to prices in the low twenties per Bbl in Phase I of our tertiary operations in Southwest Mississippi), and (iii) we have virtually no competition for this type of activity in our geographic area. Generally, from East Texas to Florida, there are no known significant natural sources of carbon dioxide except our own, and these large volumes of CO2 that we own drive the play. CO2 RESOURCES. In February 2001, we acquired the sources of CO2 located near Jackson, Mississippi, and a pipeline to transport it to our oil fields. Since February 2001, we have acquired two producing wells and drilled seven CO2 producing wells, tripling our initial proven CO2 reserves to 2.7 Tcf as of December 31, 2004 (including the 178.7 Bcf of reserves dedicated to two VPPs with Genesis). The estimate of 2.7 Tcf of proved CO2 reserves is based on total CO2 reserves in the fields, of which Denburys net ownership is approximately 2.1 Tcf and is included in the evaluation of proven CO2 reserves by DeGolyer & MacNaughton included as Exhibit 99. In discussing the available CO2 reserves, we make reference to the gross amount of proved reserves as that is the amount that is available both for Denburys tertiary recovery programs and for industrial users who are customers of Denbury and others, as we are responsible for distributing the entire CO2 production stream for both of these purposes. We currently estimate that it will take approximately 711 Bcf of CO2 to develop and produce the proved tertiary recovery reserves we have recorded at December 31, 2004. Today, we own every known producing CO2 well in the region, providing us a significant strategic advantage in the acquisition of other properties in Mississippi and Louisiana that could be further exploited through tertiary recovery. As of January 2005, we are capable of producing approximately 350 MMcf/d of CO2, about four times the production capacity at the time of our initial acquisition of the Jackson Dome field. We continue to drill additional CO2 wells, with four more wells planned for 2005, which are expected to further increase our production capacity and potentially increase our proven CO2 reserves. We believe we have sufficient CO2 reserves for our first two phases of tertiary operations in Western Mississippi and Eastern Mississippi, but would like to add additional reserves for future phases, plus we need to further increase our production capacity as our current model for phases I and II requires almost 700 MMcf/d of CO2 production by 2009. Although we believe that our plans and projections are reasonable and achievable, there could be delays or unforeseen problems in the future which could delay our overall tertiary development program. We believe that such delays, if any, should only be temporary. In addition to using CO2 for our tertiary operations, we sell CO2 to third party industrial users under long term contracts. Our net operating margin from 30 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations these sales was $6.2 million during 2002, $6.5 million during 2003, and $4.9 million during 2004. Our average CO2 production during 2002, 2003 and 2004 was approximately 104 million, 170 million, and 218 million cubic feet per day, of which approximately 54% in 2002, 62% in 2003, and 73% in 2004 was used in our tertiary recovery operations, with the balance sold to third parties for industrial use. We spent approximately $0.12 per Mcf to produce our CO2 during 2004, slightly less than our 2003 annual average of $0.15 per Mcf, primarily due to the lack of any significant workover expenses like we had in 2003, partially offset by higher royalty expenses because certain of our royalties are adjusted based on oil prices. During 2002, we spent approximately $0.13 per Mcf to produce our CO2. Our estimated total cost per thousand cubic feet of CO2 during 2004 was approximately $0.21, after inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense related to the CO2 production. OIL POTENTIAL. Although our oil production from our CO2 tertiary recovery activities is still relatively modest (approximately 25% of fourth quarter 2004 production), we expect it to be an ever increasing portion of our production. We currently have tertiary operations on going at Little Creek, Mallalieu, McComb and Brookhaven Fields, as well as various smaller adjacent fields. We project that our oil production from these operations will increase substantially over the next several years, along with our tentatively scheduled tertiary projects at other oil fields along our pipeline. As of January 2005, these fields were producing approximately 8,300 Bbls/d. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 50.5 MMBbls of proven oil reserves related to tertiary operations in these fields along our CO2 pipeline and have identified and estimated significant additional potential in fields that we own in this area. In addition, we have commenced operations to expand this program to East Mississippi and have commenced the acquisition of leases and right of way for the construction of an 84 mile CO2 pipeline from our source wells near Jackson, Mississippi to Eucutta Field in East Mississippi. While our current tertiary operations in the Southwest part of Mississippi are economic at NYMEX per barrel oil prices in the low twenties, due predominately to the lower quality of oil in East Mississippi, we estimate that it requires a NYMEX oil price in the mid to upper twenties for the same rate of return in this part of the state. We believe that this expansion, labeled Phase II, has significant other oil potential well beyond the first six fields that we have engineered and currently plan to flood. Combining the production forecast for both of these areas extends the period during which we anticipate significant oil production growth from a few years, for Phase I alone, to five to ten years combined. While it is extremely difficult to accurately forecast production, we do believe that our tertiary recovery operations provide significant long term production growth potential at reasonable rates of return with relatively low risk and will be the backbone of our Companys growth for the foreseeable future. FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACT OF CO2 OPERATIONS. The increasing emphasis on CO2 tertiary recovery projects has made, and will continue to make, an impact on our financial results and certain operating statistics different from conventional development activities. First, there is a significant delay between the initial capital expenditures and the resulting production increases, as these tertiary operations require the building of facilities before CO2 flooding can commence and it usually takes six to twelve months before the field responds (i.e. oil production commences) to the injection of CO2. Further, as we expand to other areas beyond Phase I, there will be times when we spend significant amounts of capital before we can recognize any proven reserves as these other areas, for the most part, will require an oil production response to the CO2 injections before any oil reserves can be recorded. We plan to spend over $50 million on Phase II oil fields during 2005, plus an additional $45 million on the CO2 pipeline to East Mississippi. Secondly, these tertiary projects are more expensive to operate than our other oil fields because of the cost of injecting and recycling the CO2 (primarily due to the significant energy requirements to re compress the CO2 back into a liquid state for re injection purposes). As commodity and energy prices increase, so does our operating expenses in these fields. As such, our overall operating expenses on a per BOE basis will likely continue to increase as these operations constitute an increasingly larger percentage of our operations. Our operating cost for our tertiary operations during 2004 averaged $9.90 per BOE, as compared to an estimated cost of around $5 to $7 per BOE for a more traditional oil property. We allocate the cost to produce and transport the CO2 between CO2 used in our own oil fields and CO2 sold to commercial users. The CO2 operating expenses allocated to our oil fields are recorded as lease operating expenses on those fields. Third, all of our current CO2 operations are in fields that produce light sweet oil and receive oil prices close to, and sometimes actually higher than, NYMEX prices. As this production becomes a larger percentage of our overall production, the overall average difference between the prices we receive and published NYMEX prices should decrease, assuming other market conditions do not 31 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations change. While our oil prices have historically averaged between $4.00 and $5.00 below NYMEX prices, our 2002 average was $3.74 below NYMEX and our 2003 average decreased further to $3.60 below NYMEX. During 2004, the market for sour and heavy crude oil (predominately our East Mississippi production) deteriorated, causing our overall average differential to increase to $4.91 per barrel for the year and to $6.48 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2004. While we cannot predict what will happen to the market for heavy and sour crude, we do expect our light sweet oil production to increase as a percentage of our total oil production over the next few years. However, this trend could reverse in future years as the anticipated oil production from Phase II of our tertiary operations is primarily heavy and sour oil. 2004 CO2 Tertiary Recovery Operating Activities. Our oil production from our CO2 tertiary recovery activities has steadily increased during the last few years, from 3,970 Bbls/d in 2002 to 4,671 Bbls/d during 2003, and to 6,784 Bbls/d during 2004, with a fourth quarter 2004 rate of 7,242 Bbls/d. This represents approximately 37% of our total corporate oil production during the fourth quarter of 2004 and approximately 25% of our total corporate production on a BOE basis. We expect that this oil production will continue to increase, although the increases are not always predictable or consistent. While we did experience higher energy costs to operate our tertiary recycling facilities as a result of higher commodity prices, we were able to lower our operating cost per BOE in our tertiary operations from $11.34 per BOE in 2003 to $9.90 per BOE during 2004 because of the higher tertiary oil production levels. In addition to higher energy costs, we experienced general cost inflation in the industry and also commenced lease payments on certain of our recycling facilities (see "Commitments and Obligations" above). As a result, the absolute amount of operating expenses related to tertiary operations increased from $14.3 million during 2002 to $19.3 million during 2003 and $24.6 million during 2004. At December 31, 2004, we had proved reserves of 50.5 MMBbls relating to our tertiary recovery operations. Through December 31, 2004, we had spent a total of $155.6 million on fields involved in this process, and had received $160.0 million in net cash flow (revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures), or net positive cash flow of $4.4 million. The proved oil reserves in our CO2 fields have a PV 10 Value of $782.9 million, using December 31, 2004 constant NYMEX pricing of $43.45 per Bbl. These amounts do not include the capital costs or related depreciation and amortization of our CO2 producing properties. Through December 31, 2004, we have spent a total of $132.8 million on our CO2 producing properties, received a total of $57.4 million in net cash flow (revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures, consisting solely of sales to industrial customers and Genesis volumetric production payment receipts), leaving us a balance of approximately $75.4 million of unrecovered costs for the CO2 assets. CO2 Related Capital Budget for 2005. Tentatively, we plan to spend approximately $35 million in 2005 in the Jackson Dome area with the intent to add additional CO2 reserves and deliverability for future operations. Approximately $60 million in capital expenditures is budgeted in 2005 for our oil fields with tertiary operations in Southwest Mississippi and approximately $50 million for oil fields in East Mississippi, plus an additional $45 million for the CO2 pipeline to East Mississippi, increasing our combined CO2 related expenditures to over 60% of our 2005 capital budget. Operating Income Cash flow from operations and net income have been strong for the last three years, primarily because of higher than historical commodity prices. Production declined slightly (2%) from 2002 to 2003 and approximately 5% from 2003 to 2004, with most of the current year decrease related to the sale of our offshore properties (see also "Overview"). The higher commodity prices each year more than offset the production decline, resulting in higher overall net income and adjusted cash flow from operations each year from 2002 through 2004 (see discussion below regarding this non GAAP measure, adjusted cash flow from operations).

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Adjusted cash flow from operations is a non GAAP measure that represents cash flow provided by operations before changes in assets and liabilities, as calculated from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash flow from operations is the GAAP measure as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In our discussion herein, we have elected to discuss these two components of cash flow provided by operations. Adjusted cash flow from operations, the non GAAP measure, measures the cash flow earned or incurred from operating activities without regard to the collection or payment of associated receivables or payables. We believe that it is important to consider adjusted cash flow from operations separately, as we believe it can often be a better way to discuss changes in operating trends in our business caused by changes in production, prices, operating costs, and related operational factors, without regard to whether the earned or incurred item was collected or paid during that year. We also use this measure because the collection of our receivables or payment of our obligations has not been a significant issue for our business, but merely a timing issue from one period to the next, with fluctuations generally caused by significant changes in commodity prices or significant changes in drilling activity. The net change in assets and liabilities relating to operations is also important as it does require or provide additional cash for use in our business; however, we prefer to discuss its effect separately. For instance, as noted above, during 2003, our accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased as a result of our higher drilling activity level late in the year, particularly offshore, increasing our available cash from operations. During 2004, we had a $31.5 million difference between our adjusted cash flow from operations and our GAAP cash flow from operations. The most significant factor was the transfer of approximately $12.5 million of accrued production receivables relating to our offshore properties that existed as of the closing date to the offshore property purchaser. This reduction in accrued production receivables during 2004 was not considered a collection of receivables for our GAAP cash flow from operations. In addition to the effect of transferred receivables, our other accrued production receivables increased during the year due to the increase in commodity prices and we reduced our accounts payable and accrued liabilities by approximately $10.5 million, as a result of less overall activity as of year end, both of which contributed to the significant difference between our 2004 adjusted cash flow and GAAP cash flow from operations. 33 Denbury Resources Inc.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations PRODUCTION. Average daily production by area for 2002, 2003 and 2004, and each of the quarters of 2004 is listed in the following table (BOE/d). Average Daily Production (BOE/d) First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Operating Area 2002 2003 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 Mississippi non CO2 floods 13,378 13,638 12,754 13,048 12,969 13,564 13,085 Mississippi CO2 floods 3,970 4,671 6,318 6,603 6,967 7,242 6,784 Onshore Louisiana 8,050 8,222 8,825 7,492 7,033 7,182 7,630 Barnett Shale and other 200 224 229 345 803 963 587 Total production excl. offshore 25,598 26,755 28,126 27,488 27,772 28,951 28,086 Offshore Gulf of Mexico 9,975 7,949 8,521 9,114 1,885 26 4,865 Total Company 35,573 34,704 36,647 36,602 29,657 28,977 32,951 As a result of the sale of our offshore properties in July 2004, third and fourth quarter 2004 production decreased significantly from prior periods as listed in the above table. Adjusting for the offshore sale, overall production increased approximately 5% on a BOE/d basis during both 2003 and 2004, anchored by the increased production from our tertiary operations and Barnett Shale play, generally offset by overall declines in our onshore natural gas wells in Louisiana. However, other factors that caused fluctuations between the various periods should also be noted as outlined below. The addition of properties acquired from COHO during August 2002 contributed to the majority of the increase in our overall production in the Mississippi non CO2 flood properties from 2002 to 2003, as most of these pre existing non CO2 fields in Mississippi have been on a slow decline as a result of normal depletion. Heidelberg Field, our single largest field that is located in this area, has partially offset this decline, as its production increased each year, from 7,479 BOE/d during 2002 to 7,535 BOE/d during 2003 to 7,775 BOE/d during 2004. Most of this increase at Heidelberg is attributable to additional natural gas drilling in the Selma Chalk formation as Heidelbergs oil production has been slowly decreasing. Natural gas production at this field averaged 7.1 MMcf/d in 2002, 10.3 MMcf/d in 2003 and 13.8 MMcf/d in 2004, making Heidelberg Field our single largest natural gas producing field during 2004. As more fully discussed in "CO2 Operations" above, oil production from our tertiary operations has increased each year. Production from our offshore properties averaged 1,885 BOE/d in the third quarter, representing the production during the first 19 days of July prior to the sale. As evidenced in the above table, production from this area has fluctuated over the last three years primarily due to the level of activity and the fluctuations caused by the short lived nature of these natural gas reserves. As an example, offshore production increased in early 2004 as a result of 15 well completions made late in the fourth quarter of 2003, four at Brazos A 21, three at North Padre A 9, three at Chandeleur Sound 69, two at West Cameron 192 and three at West Cameron 427. Some of our natural gas properties in onshore Louisiana have similar characteristics as is evident by the steep declines during 2004. While the production from onshore Louisiana only declined 7% on an annual basis, there was a 19% drop between the first quarter of 2004 and last quarter of 2004. A significant portion of this decline was at Thornwell Field, an onshore Louisiana field, which averaged 926 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2004, down from 2,526 BOE/d in the first quarter of 2004 and 2,487 BOE/d during 2003. Production from this field is in a steep decline due to its short lived nature, and is expected to further decline in the future. In spite of its short remaining life, we have generated a good return on investment at Thornwell, generating $37.0 million of net positive cash flow (operating revenues less operating expenses and capital expenditures) through December 31, 2004, with a remaining PV 10 Value of $37.4 million as of December 31, 2004 (based on SEC proved reserve report at year end 2004 prices). 35 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Production in the Barnett Shale area has just recently begun to increase as a result of five horizontal wells drilled and completed in this area during the latter part of 2004. We plan to drill around 25 more wells there in 2005 and expect production from this area to further increase during 2005. Our production for 2004 was weighted slightly toward oil (58%), although the fourth quarter 2004 average was 68% oil following the sale of the offshore properties in July 2004. It appears that we will remain similarly weighted toward oil in 2005 due to our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations, unless we make an acquisition that is predominantly natural gas. OIL AND NATURAL GAS REVENUES. Our oil and natural gas revenues have increased for each of the last two years. Two factors cause the change in pre hedging revenues: commodity prices and production levels. Between 2003 and 2004, revenues increased by 15%, primarily due to higher commodity prices. The overall increase in commodity prices contributed $77.8 million in additional revenues, a 20% increase; partially offset by an overall decrease of $18.5 million (a 5% decrease) related to the 5% lower production volumes. Between 2002 and 2003, revenues increased by 40%, also primarily due to higher commodity prices. The overall increase in commodity prices contributed $117.3 million in additional revenues, a 43% increase; partially offset by an overall decrease in revenues of $6.7 million (a 2% decrease) related to the 2% lower production volumes. During 2004, we paid out $64.1 million on our oil hedges ($9.10 per Bbl) and $20.4 million ($0.68 per Mcf) on our natural gas hedges relating to swaps and collars we purchased one to two years earlier when commodity prices were lower. About $30.5 million of the hedge payments related to swaps originally put in place to protect the rate of return for the COHO acquisition in August 2002. The payments in 2003 were similar in nature, but slightly less due to lower overall commodity prices. During 2003, we paid out $20.3 million on our oil hedges ($2.95 per Bbl) and $41.9 million ($1.21 per Mcf) on our natural gas hedges on generally the same swaps and collars. During 2002, we had total net receipts on our hedges of $932,000, paying out $0.6 million ($0.09 per Bbl) on our oil hedges, but collecting a net $1.5 million ($0.04 per Mcf) on our natural gas hedges. For 2005, we have hedged a lower percentage of our overall production, predominately with puts or price floors, so we anticipate that our hedge payments will be substantially lower than the payments made in 2004. See "Market Risk Management" for a further discussion of our hedging activities and position. Our net oil and natural gas prices have fluctuated as outlined on the prior table. During 2004, we received the highest weighted average net price per BOE in our history, netting $29.87 per BOE even after paying out approximately $7.01 per BOE for hedge losses. This resulted from average NYMEX prices of over $41.00 per Bbl and $6.00 per MMBtu during the year. Prices were also strong during 2003, although not quite as high, netting Denbury $25.52 per BOE, net of the $4.91 per BOE hedge losses. During 2003 we also had one of our best years with regard to our realized net price relative to NYMEX prices. During 2002, we received an average discount to NYMEX of $3.74 per Bbl. This improved in 2003 to an average discount of $3.60 per Bbl. This trend was reversed in 2004 as the heavy, sour crude market (which predominately applies to our Eastern Mississippi production) deteriorated significantly, increasing our average oil differentials for the year to $4.91 per Bbl and $6.48 per Bbl for the fourth quarter of 2004. If market conditions for the heavy, sour crude remained consistent, we would expect to gradually improve the overall NYMEX discount as the amount of light sweet oil production from our tertiary operations is expected to increase, improving the overall quality of our product mix. However, as evident in 2004, the oil market can change substantially. Year over year, there is generally less fluctuation in our natural gas prices relative to NYMEX. Normally, we are at, or slightly above, the NYMEX market, primarily because of the high Btu content of our natural gas. For 2004, we had an average $0.02 premium to NYMEX, a little less than the $0.18 premium during 2003, but higher than the $0.05 discount in 2002. As we increase our emphasis on the Barnett Shale area in 2005, the overall price we receive for our natural gas could decline slightly as our properties in this area have historically received a price that is $0.50 to $0.75 less than NYMEX prices. OPERATING EXPENSES. Lease operating expenses increased to $7.22 per BOE in 2004, a 2% increase over the $7.06 per BOE average during 2003, and an increase of 32% from the $5.48 per BOE average during 2002. During 2004, our workover expenses decreased as compared to 2003, when we spent $2.8 million on two individually significant workovers relating to mechanical failures of two onshore Louisiana wells, plus several smaller workovers. Operating expenses on our tertiary operations increased from $14.3 million during 2002 to $19.3 million in 2003 to $24.6 million in 2004 as a result of increased activity at Mallalieu and McComb Fields. However, with the 45% higher production from these tertiary operations between the same periods, operating expenses for our tertiary operations on a per BOE basis decreased from $11.34 per BOE in 2003 to $9.90 per BOE in 2004. Nonetheless, our tertiary operations are steadily increasing our aggregate dollar costs and our costs per BOE on a total corporate 36 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations basis as our tertiary operations constitute a more significant portion of our total production and operations. The balance of cost increases during 2004 is generally attributable to higher energy costs to operate our tertiary recovery properties, a provision for potential litigation losses, and general cost inflation in our industry. In general, we expect our operating costs per BOE to further increase in the future as the operating costs of our tertiary operations are higher than the costs of our other operations. Most of the increase from 2002 to 2003 was attributable to the aforementioned workovers, with several other smaller workovers, including one on a CO2 well. The growth of our tertiary operations also contributed to an overall increase, as well as higher lease fuel costs and a full year of expenses on the properties acquired from COHO, which have typically had higher expenses on a per BOE basis than our other oil properties due to their age. Production taxes and marketing expenses generally change in proportion to commodity prices and therefore, were higher in 2004 along with the record high commodity prices. The sale of our offshore properties also contributed to the increase in production taxes and marketing expenses on a per BOE basis during 2004, as most of our offshore properties were tax exempt. General and Administrative Expenses During the last three years, general and administrative ("G&A") expenses on a per BOE basis have increased from $0.96 per BOE during 2002, to $1.20 per BOE during 2003, to $1.78 per BOE during 2004, increasing even faster than the gross aggregate dollar increases in G&A expense as production has declined each year due primarily to property sales. Year Ended December 31, Amounts in Thousands Except Per BOE and Employee Data 2004 2003 2002 Gross G&A expense $ 53,658 $ 46,031 $ 40,149 Operator overhead charges (28,048) (26,823) (23,857) Capitalized exploration expense (5,072) (5,507) (5,325) 20,538 13,701 10,967 State franchise taxes 923 1,488 1,459 Net G&A expense $ 21,461 $ 15,189 $ 12,426 Average G&A expense per BOE $ 1.78 $ 1.20 $ 0.96 Employees as of December 31 380 374 356 Gross G&A expenses increased $7.6 million, or 17%, between 2003 and 2004. The largest component of the increase was approximately $2.4 million of employee severance payments for the offshore professional and technical staff terminated in conjunction with our offshore property sale. We also incurred additional G&A expenses associated with our corporate restructuring in December 2003, compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, the sale of stock by the Texas Pacific Group in March 2004, a provision for potential litigation losses, restricted stock grants, higher bonus levels for employees than in 2003 due to the strong performance during 2004, and overall increases in most other categories of G&A due to general cost inflation. During the third and fourth quarters of 2004, we granted a total of 1,150,000 million shares of restricted stock to our officers and independent directors, generating deferred compensation expense of approximately $23.3 million, the market value of the shares on the date of grant. A portion of this restricted stock vests over five years and a smaller portion vests upon retirement (in addition to vesting upon death, disability or a change of control). We are amortizing the non cash $23.3 million of compensation expense of this restricted stock over the five year vesting period and over the projected retirement date vesting period, expensing approximately $1.6 million during 2004. We estimate that amortized compensation expense for the restricted stock will be approximately $1.0 million per quarter through 2006. Gross aggregate dollar G&A expenses increased $5.9 million, or 15%, between 2002 and 2003. The largest component of the increase was approximately $1.4 million of expenses spent for consultants hired to help document and test our system of internal controls, a requirement of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The second largest source of the increase was approximately $630,000 of legal, accounting, bank and other fees associated with the conversion to a holding 37 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations company organizational structure during December 2003 which reduced our franchise taxes by $565,000 between 2003 and 2004. Other factors also contributed to the increase, the most significant being expenses associated with the sale of stock by the Texas Pacific Group in the first and last quarters of 2003, higher year end expenses for engineering and audit fees, and an overall increase in personnel and associated expenses primarily related to cost of living salary increases. Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in our 2003 bonuses due to less positive operating results during 2003 in certain areas. Higher operator overhead recovery charges resulting from the incremental development activity helped to partially offset the increase in gross G&A, partially reduced by the impact of the offshore property sale. Our well operating agreements allow us, when we are the operator, to charge a well with a specified overhead rate during the drilling phase and also to charge a monthly fixed overhead rate for each producing well. As a result of the additional operated wells from acquisitions, additional tertiary operations, and drilling activity during the past year, the amount we recovered as operator overhead charges increased by 12% between 2002 and 2003 and 5% between 2003 and 2004. Capitalized exploration costs increased slightly between 2002 and 2003, along with increases in employee related costs, but decreased in 2004 as a result of the personnel reductions in our offshore area as a result of the property sale. The net effect of the increases in gross G&A expenses, operator overhead recoveries and capitalized exploration costs was a 41% increase in net G&A expense between 2003 and 2004 and a 22% increase between 2002 and 2003. The increase was even higher on a per BOE basis as a result of lower production, primarily related to the offshore property sale. Interest and Financing Expenses Year Ended December 31, Amounts in Thousands Except Per BOE Data 2004 2003 2002 Interest expense $ 19,468 $ 23,201 $ 26,833 Non cash interest expense (962) (1,251) (2,659) Cash interest expense 18,506 21,950 24,174 Interest and other income (2,388) (1,573) (1,746) Net cash interest expense $ 16,118 $ 20,377 $ 22,428 Average net cash interest expense per BOE $ 1.34 $ 1.61 $ 1.73 Average debt outstanding $ 270,770 $ 341,496 $ 350,556 Average interest rate (1) 6.8% 6.4% 6.9% (1) Includes commitment fees but excludes amortization of debt issue costs. Interest expense for 2004 decreased from 2003 primarily due to lower average debt levels as a result of our $50 million reduction in debt during 2003 and the payoff of our bank debt in the third quarter of 2004 with the proceeds from our offshore property sale. Our non cash interest expense in 2004 decreased as a result of the subordinated debt refinancing in March 2003, which eliminated the amortization of discount on our old subordinated debt, which was higher than the discount and related amortization on our new subordinated debt issue. Interest and other income increased as a result of the cash generated from the offshore property sale. Interest expense for 2003 decreased from levels in the prior year for similar reasons, (i) lower overall interest rates, resulting from an overall drop in market interest rates on our bank debt and due to the refinancing of our subordinated debt, (ii) lower average outstanding debt balance during 2003, as we reduced debt by $50 million during the year, and (iii) reduced debt issue cost amortization resulting from the complete amortization of costs associated with the original maturity of our bank credit line in December 2002 after we refinanced and extended the bank credit line to April 2006. 38 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization ("DD&A") Year Ended December 31, Amounts in Thousands, Except Per BOE Data 2004 2003 2002 Depletion and depreciation of oil and natural gas properties $ 88,505 $ 87,842 $ 87,728 Depletion and depreciation of CO2 assets 4,664 2,542 1,858 Asset retirement obligations 2,408 2,852 2,951 Depreciation of other fixed assets 1,950 1,472 1,699 Total DD&A $ 97,527 $ 94,708 $ 94,236 DD&A per BOE: Oil and natural gas properties $ 7.54 $ 7.16 $ 6.98 CO2 assets and other fixed assets 0.55 0.32 0.28 Total DD&A cost per BOE $ 8.09 $ 7.48 $ 7.26 But for the property sales, our total proved reserve quantities would have increased each of the last three years. Our proved reserves decreased from 130.7 MMBOE as of December 31, 2002, to 128.2 MMBOE as of December 31, 2003 and increased slightly to 129.4 MMBOE as of December 31, 2004. During 2003 we sold approximately 8.3 MMBOE of proved reserves and during 2004 sold approximately 16.5 MMBOE of proved reserves, primarily related to the offshore sale. Reserve quantities and associated production are only one side of the DD&A equation, with capital expenditures, asset retirement obligations less related salvage value, and projected future development costs making up the remainder of the calculation. In total, our DD&A rate on a per BOE basis increased 8% between 2003 and 2004, primarily due to the higher percentage of expenditures on offshore properties during 2003 and the first six months of 2004, which have higher overall finding and development costs, and an increase in certain of our future development cost estimates to reflect the rising costs in the industry. Although the 2004 average DD&A rate was similar to the DD&A rate of $8.00 per BOE during the fourth quarter of 2003, during the year there were significant fluctuations. Our DD&A rate on a per BOE basis decreased in the third quarter of 2004 to $7.62 per BOE from $8.46 per BOE in the second quarter, primarily as a result of the sale of our offshore properties, the proceeds of which were credited to the full cost pool. However, the rate increased in the fourth quarter of 2004 to $7.98 per BOE, primarily to reflect cost inflation in the industry, as we increased our cost estimates (i.e. future development costs) for certain existing proved undeveloped reserves. We adjust our DD&A rate each quarter based on any changes in our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and costs, and thus our DD&A rate could change significantly in the future. Our DD&A rate for our CO2 and other fixed assets increased in 2004 as a result of the additional cost incurred drilling CO2 wells during the year and higher associated future development costs, partially offset by an increase in CO2 reserves from 1.6 Tcf as of December 31, 2003 to 2.7 Tcf as of December 31, 2004 (100% working interest basis before amounts attributable to Genesis volumetric production payments see "CO2 Operations CO2 Resources"). During 2003, the fourth quarter DD&A rate increased to $8.00 per BOE, increasing the 2003 annual average to $7.48 per BOE. The higher DD&A was partially due to the higher percentage of capital expenditures spent on our offshore properties, 34% during 2003 as compared to approximately 10% during 2002, where we have a higher overall finding cost. The rate was also affected by less than hoped for drilling results in the Gulf of Mexico and Southern Louisiana, particularly in the fourth quarter, where some of our larger exploration potential failed to materialize. In contrast to our offshore properties, our tertiary operations have yielded a finding and development cost, including the net change in forecasted future development and abandonment costs, of just under $6.00 per BOE inception to December 31, 2004, in line with our long term expectations, helping to partially offset the higher finding and development cost of our offshore and other natural gas properties. Prior to 2003, we provided for the estimated future costs of well abandonment and site reclamation, net of any anticipated salvage, on a unit of production basis. This provision was included in DD&A expense and increased each year, along with a general increase in the number of our properties, especially the acquisition of our offshore properties. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred, discounted to its present value using our credit adjusted risk free interest rate, and that a corresponding amount be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related 39 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations long lived asset. The liability is accreted each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. If the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, the difference is recorded to the full cost pool, unless significant. As part of this adoption, we ceased accruing for site reclamation costs, as had been our practice in the past, and recorded a $41.0 million liability representing the estimated present value of our retirement obligations, with a $34.4 million increase to oil and natural gas properties. On an undiscounted basis, we estimated our retirement obligations as of December 31, 2003 to be $82.7 million, with an estimated salvage value of $43.3 million, also on an undiscounted basis. As of December 31, 2004, we estimated our retirement obligations to be $52.1 million ($21.5 million present value), with an estimate salvage value of $43.6 million, the decrease related to the sale of our offshore properties. DD&A is calculated on the increase to oil and natural gas and CO2 properties, net of estimated salvage value. We also include the accretion of discount on the asset retirement obligation in our DD&A expense. Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation. We did not have any full cost pool ceiling test write downs in 2002, 2003 or 2004 and do not expect to have any such write downs in the foreseeable future at current commodity price levels. Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, Amounts in Thousands, Except Per BOE Amounts 2004 2003 2002 Current income tax expense (benefit) $ 22,929 $ (91) $ (406) Defered income tax provision 16,463 26,303 23,926 Total income tax provision $ 39,392 $ 26,212 $ 23,520 Average income tax provision per BOE $ 3.27 $ 2.07 $ 1.81 Net effective tax rate 32.3% 32.7% 33.4% Federal tax net operating loss carryforwards $ $ 94,955 $ 84,891 Total net deferred tax asset (liability) (71,936) (43,539) (21,777) Our income tax provision for 2004 was increased to an estimated statutory tax rate of 39% to reflect the changes in our state income tax rates resulting from the sale of our offshore properties. Our tax provision for 2002 and 2003 was based on an estimated statutory rate of 38%. Our net effective tax rate for all periods was lower than the statutory rates, primarily due to the recognition of enhanced oil recovery credits which lowered our overall tax rate. The current income tax expense represents our anticipated alternative minimum cash taxes that we could not offset with our regular tax net operating loss carryforwards or our enhanced oil recovery credits. During the third quarter of 2004, we recognized approximately $21.0 million of current income taxes as a result of the sale of our offshore properties, which was a gain for income tax purposes. The taxes on the offshore sale were primarily alternative minimum taxes as we were able to offset the related regular tax with our net operating loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2004, we had utilized all of our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards, but had an estimated $27.8 million of enhanced oil recovery credits to carryforward. Since the ability to earn additional enhanced oil recovery credits is reduced or even eliminated based on the level of oil prices, our effective tax rate and cash taxes could both increase in the future if oil prices remain at current levels or increase further. Our overall current income tax credit for 2002 was the result of a tax law change that allowed us to offset 100% of our 2001 alternative minimum taxes with our alternative minimum tax net operating loss carryforwards. Prior to the law change, we were able to offset only 90% of our alternative minimum taxes with these carryforwards. This change resulted in a refund of cash taxes paid for 2001 and a reclassification of tax expense between current and deferred taxes, but did not impact our overall effective tax rate. 40 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations on a per BOE Basis The following table summarizes the cash flow, DD&A and results of operations on a per BOE basis for the comparative periods. Each of the individual components is discussed above.

These debt agreements expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates. The following table presents the carrying and fair values of our debt, along with average interest rates. We had no bank debt outstanding as of December 31, 2004. The fair value of the subordinated debt is based on quoted market prices. None of our debt has any triggers or covenants regarding our debt ratings with rating agencies. Expected Maturity Dates Carrying Fair Amounts in Thousands 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Value Value Fixed rate debt: Subordinated debt, net of discount $223,397 $243,000 (The interest rate on the subordinated debt is a fixed rate of 7.5%.) We enter into various financial contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. These contracts have historically consisted of price floors, collars and fixed price swaps. Historically, we have generally attempted to hedge between 50% and 75% of our anticipated production each year to provide us with a reasonably certain amount of cash flow to cover most of our budgeted exploration and development expenditures without incurring significant debt, although our hedging percentage may vary relative to our debt levels. For 2005 and beyond, we have hedged significantly less, primarily because of our strong financial position resulted from our lower levels of debt relative to our cash flow from operations. When we make a significant acquisition, we generally attempt to hedge a large percentage, up to 100%, of the forecasted proved production for the subsequent one to three years following the acquisition in order to help provide us with a minimum return on our investment. Much of our historical hedging activity has been done with collars, although for the COHO acquisition, we also used swaps in order to lock in the prices used in our economic forecasts. For 2005, all of our oil hedges are puts or price floors, allowing us to retain any price upside, while still providing protection in the event of lower prices at a fixed and determinable price (i.e. the cost of the put). We anticipate using more price floors in the future. All of the mark to market valuations used for our financial derivatives are provided by external sources and are based on prices that are actively quoted. We manage and control market and counterparty credit risk through established internal control procedures 41 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations that are reviewed on an ongoing basis. We attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies, monitoring procedures, and diversification. For a full description of our hedging position at year end 2004, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon reaching a verbal agreement with the purchaser (Newfield Exploration Company) of our offshore properties, subject primarily to their further due diligence, we entered into natural gas swaps on a total of 23.6 Bcf for the period of July 2004 through December 2005, covering the anticipated natural gas production from our offshore properties for that period, with the tacit understanding with the prospective purchaser that these hedges would be transferred to them upon closing. These swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting and during the third quarter of 2004, we assigned them to Newfield. During the period that we owned them, we recognized approximately $2.5 million of gain as the hedges appreciated in value before we assigned them to Newfield. At about the same time, with the expectation that the offshore transaction would be consummated, we retired, by purchasing offsetting contracts, 20 MMcf/d of our natural gas hedges for July to December of 2004, at a cost of approximately $3.9 million. This transaction, net of the related gain on the hedges assigned to Newfield, was the primary reason for the $1.3 million net charge to earnings during 2004 relating to our derivative contracts that were not part of the monthly cash settlements on our derivatives contracts. At December 31, 2004, our derivative contracts were recorded at their fair value, which was a net liability of approximately $4.9 million, a decrease of approximately $39.7 million from the $44.6 million fair value liability recorded as of December 31, 2003. This change is the result of the expiration of most of our derivative contracts during 2004 due to the passage of time. Effective January 1, 2005, we have elected to de designate our existing derivative contracts as hedges and to account for them as speculative contracts going forward. This means that any changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the balance to earnings. Information regarding our current hedging positions and historical hedging results is included in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on NYMEX crude oil futures prices at December 31, 2004, prices were considerably higher than the floor price of $27.50, so we would not expect to receive any funds even if oil prices were to drop 10%. Since the oil hedges are puts or price floors, we do not have to make any payments on the hedges regardless of how high oil prices would go. Based on NYMEX natural gas futures prices at December 31, 2004, we would expect to make future cash payments of $4.2 million on our natural gas commodity hedges. If natural gas futures prices were to decline by 10%, the amount we would expect to pay under our natural gas commodity hedges would decrease to $0.8 million, and if futures prices were to increase by 10% we would expect to pay $7.6 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we select certain accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments regarding the application of those policies. Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements. Full Cost Method of Accounting, Depletion and Depreciation and Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Businesses involved in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. We apply the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Another acceptable method of accounting for oil and gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting. In general, the primary differences between the two methods are related to the capitalization of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment. Under the full cost method, all geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool, whereas under the successful efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred. In the assessment of impairment of oil and gas properties, the successful efforts method follows the guidance of SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," under which assets are measured for impairment against the undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method, the full cost pool (net book value of oil and gas properties) is measured against future cash flows discounted at ten percent using commodity prices in effect at the end of the reporting period. The financial results for a 42 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations given period could be substantially different depending on the method of accounting an oil and gas entity applies. In our application of full cost accounting for our oil and gas producing activities, we make significant estimates at the end of each period related to accruals for oil and gas revenues, production, capitalized costs and operating expenses. We calculate these estimates with our best available data, which includes among other things, production reports, price posting, information compiled from daily drilling reports and other internal tracking devices and analysis of historical results and trends. While management is not aware of any required revisions to its estimates, there will likely be future adjustments resulting from such things as changes in ownership interests, payouts, joint venture audits, re allocations by the purchaser/pipeline, or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and natural gas industry, many of which will require retroactive application. These types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated or determined and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs. Under full cost accounting, the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom used to perform the full cost ceiling test have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible, including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare the report, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statement disclosures. Over the last four years, Denburys annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately 3% of the previous years estimates and have been both positive and negative. Changes in commodity prices also affect our reserve quantities. For instance, between 2001 and 2002, commodity prices rebounded from the prior years fall, resulting in an increase to our reserve quantities of approximately 3.5 MMBOE. During 2003 and 2004, the change related to commodity prices was virtually zero, less than in prior years, as prices were relatively high at year end 2002, 2003 and 2004. These changes in quantities affect our DD&A rate and the combined effect of changes in quantities and commodity prices impacts our full cost ceiling test calculation. For example, we estimate that a 5% increase in our estimate of proved reserves quantities would have lowered our fourth quarter DD&A rate from $7.98 per Bbl to approximately $7.64 per Bbl and a 5% decrease in our proved reserve quantities would have increased our DD&A rate to approximately $8.35 per Bbl. Also, reserve quantities and their ultimate values are the primary factors in determining the borrowing base under our bank credit facility and are determined solely by our banks. There can also be significant questions as to whether reserves are sufficiently supported by technical evidence to be considered proven. In some cases our proven reserves are less than what we believe to exist because additional evidence, including production testing, is required in order to classify the reserves as proven. In other cases, properties such as certain of our potential tertiary recovery projects may not have proven reserves assigned to them primarily because we have not yet completed a specific plan for development or firmly scheduled such development. We have a corporate policy whereby we generally do not book proved undeveloped reserves unless the project has been committed to internally, which normally means it is scheduled within the next one to three years (or at least the commencement of the project is scheduled in the case of longer term multi year projects such as waterfloods and tertiary recovery projects). Therefore, particularly with regard to potential reserves from tertiary recovery (our CO2 operations), there is uncertainty as to whether the reserves should be included as proven or not. We also have a corporate policy whereby proved undeveloped reserves must be economic at long term historical prices, which during the last two years are significantly less than the year end prices used in our reserve report. This also can have the effect of eliminating certain projects being included in our estimates of proved reserves, which projects would otherwise be included if undeveloped reserves were determined to be economic solely based on current prices in a high price environment, as was the case at year end 2003 and year end 2004. (See "Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization" under "Results of Operations" above for a further discussion.) All of these factors and the decisions made regarding these issues can have a significant effect on our proven reserves and thus on our DD&A rate, full cost ceiling test calculation, borrowing base and financial statements. 43 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Asset Retirement Obligations We have significant obligations related to the plugging and abandonment of our oil and gas wells, and the removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage and returning such land to its original condition. SFAS No. 143 requires that we estimate the future cost of this obligation, discount it to its present value, and record a corresponding asset and liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates, including the ultimate expected cost of the obligation, the expected future date of the required cash payment, and interest and inflation rates. Revisions to these estimates may be required based on changes to cost estimates, the timing of settlement, and changes in legal requirements. Any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis and an adjustment in our DD&A expense in future periods. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our asset retirement obligations. Income Taxes We make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. Our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared, therefore we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes, tax credits and prior to year end 2004, net operating loss carryforwards. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns. Further, we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets (primarily our enhanced oil recovery credits). If recovery is not likely, we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover, which would result in an increase to our income tax expense. As of December 31, 2004, we believe that all of our deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet will ultimately be recovered. If our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not probable. A 1% change in our effective tax rate would have increased our calculated income tax expense by approximately $1,200,000, $800,000, and $700,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning our income taxes. Hedging Activities We enter into derivative contracts (i.e., hedges) to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with future oil and natural gas production. These contracts have historically consisted of options, in the form of price floors or collars, and fixed price swaps. With the adoption of SFAS No. 133 in 2001, every derivative instrument was required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value. If the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings. If the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income (equity) to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective. We recognized ineffectiveness on our hedges of $600,000 for 2002, $282,000 for 2003 and $2.7 million for 2004. With the significant changes in commodity prices over the last two years, the fair value of our hedges has fluctuated significantly. While most of this change in value is recorded in other comprehensive income as most of our historical hedges have qualified for hedge accounting, the dramatic swing in commodity prices and the corresponding effect on the fair value of our hedges can cause a dramatic change to our balance sheet. In order to qualify for hedge accounting the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. We measure and compute hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis. If a hedging instrument becomes ineffective, hedge accounting is discontinued and any deferred gains or losses on the cash flow hedge remain in accumulated other comprehensive income until the periods during which the hedges would have otherwise expired. If we determine it probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings immediately. Most our current derivative hedging instruments qualify for hedge accounting although we plan to abandon hedge accounting as of January 1, 2005. This means that any changes in the future fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging 44 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the balance to earnings. For our three most recently completed fiscal years, if we had not chosen to designate hedge accounting treatment to our oil and natural gas hedge contracts, or if none of our derivative contracts had qualified for hedge accounting treatment, we estimate that our net income would have increased or (decreased) for 2004, 2003 and 2002 by the following amounts: $25.0 million, $(7.8) million and $(38.5) million. The preparation of financial statements requires us to make other estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reliable and believe that the ultimate actual results will not differ significantly from those reported; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and such risks and uncertainties could cause the actual results to differ materially from our estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 123(R), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB 25 and amends SFAS No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows." Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) will require all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on their estimated fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. SFAS No. 123(R) must be adopted no later that July 1, 2005 and permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods: o A "modified prospective" method in which compensation cost is recognized based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share based payments granted prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain unvested on the adoption date. o A "modified retrospective" method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No. 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25 and related interpretations. As such, we generally do not recognize compensation expense associated with employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)s fair value method could have a significant impact on Denburys future results of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. Had the Company adopted SFAS No 123(R) in prior periods, the impact would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures above. The adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R) will have no effect on the Companys unvested outstanding restricted stock awards. We currently plan to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) on July 1, 2005 using the modified prospective method. Although we have not completed evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will have on our future results of operations, we currently estimate the impact on an annual basis will be similar to our pro forma disclosures for SFAS No. 123 in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires the tax benefits in excess of recognized compensation expenses to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement may serve to reduce the Denburys future cash provided by operating activities and increase future cash provided by financing activities, to the extent of associated tax benefits that may be realized in the future. While we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were $4.8 million, $1.3 million and $0.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. In July 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force of the FASB issued EITF 04 05, "Investors Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership When the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights." In question is what rights held by the limited partners preclude consolidation of the limited partnership by the sole general partner. The Task Force noted that in practice differing views have evolved concerning this issue and it has asked the FASB staff to develop this issue for discussion at a future date. Denbury is the general partner of Genesis Energy, L.P. ("Genesis") and currently does not consolidate Genesis in its financial results based primarily on certain rights of the limited partner. This EITF has been issued for comment, with the comment period ending in February 2005. Based on our initial review of the proposed EITF, we currently do not believe that it will impact our consolidation treatment of Genesis; however, this determination is subject to further review and evaluation of the final rules. See Note 3, "Related Party Transactions Genesis" for further information regarding Denburys accounting for its investment in Genesis. 45 Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements found in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are forward looking statements, as that term is defined in Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be or may concern, among other things, forecasted capital expenditures, drilling activity or methods, acquisition plans and proposals and dispositions, development activities, cost savings, production rates and volumes, hydrocarbon reserves, hydrocarbon prices, liquidity, regulatory matters, mark to market values, competition and long term forecasts of production, finding cost, rates of return, estimated costs, future capital expenditures and overall economics and other variables surrounding our tertiary operations and future plans. Such forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as "plan," "estimate," "expect," "predict," "anticipate," "projected," "should," "assume," "believe", "target" or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Such forward looking information is based upon managements current plans, expectations, estimates and assumptions and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect current plans, anticipated actions, the timing of such actions and the Companys financial condition and results of operations. As a consequence, actual results may differ materially from expectations, estimates or assumptions expressed in or implied by any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are: fluctuations of the prices received or demand for the Companys oil and natural gas, inaccurate cost estimates, fluctuations in the prices of goods and services, the uncertainty of drilling results and reserve estimates, operating hazards, acquisition risks, requirements for capital or its availability, general economic conditions, competition and government regulations, unexpected delays, as well as the risks and uncertainties inherent in oil and gas drilling and production activities or which are otherwise discussed in this annual report, including, without limitation, the portions referenced above, and the uncertainties set forth from time to time in the Companys other public reports, filings and public statements. This Annual Report is not deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the Securities and Exchange Commission or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934.
