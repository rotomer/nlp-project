Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We are a growing independent oil and gas company engaged in acquisition, development and exploration activities in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. We are the largest oil and natural gas producer in Mississippi, own the largest reserves of carbon dioxide (CO2) used for tertiary oil recovery east of the Mississippi River, and hold significant operating acreage onshore Louisiana, Alabama, and in the Barnett Shale play near Fort Worth, Texas. Our goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling, and proven engineering extraction processes, including secondary and tertiary recovery operations. Our corporate headquarters are in Plano, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), and we have three primary field offices located in Houma, Louisiana; Laurel, Mississippi; and Cleburne, Texas. 2005 Overview Continued expansion of our tertiary operations. Since we acquired our first carbon dioxide tertiary flood in Mississippi over six years ago, we have gradually increased our emphasis on these types of operations. We particularly like this play because of its risk profile, rate of return and lack of competition in our operating area. Generally, from East Texas to Florida, there are no known significant natural sources of carbon dioxide except our own, and these large volumes of CO2 that we own drive the play. Please refer to the section entitled CO2 Operations below for a discussion of these operations, their potential, and the ramifications of our continuing emphasis on these operations. Having enough CO2 is one of the most important ingredients, if not the key ingredient, to our tertiary operations. During 2005 we increased our proved CO2 reserve quantities by 74%, from 2.7 Tcf as of December 31, 2004, to approximately 4.6 Tcf as of December 31, 2005 (both of these quantities are on a working interest basis see CO2 Operations CO2 Resources for further information). Operating results. Earnings and cash flow were at record annual levels in 2005, primarily as a result of high commodity prices. Production increased approximately 6% over the prior years production after adjusting for the production associated with our offshore properties sold in July 2004, even though we deferred approximately 1,100 BOE/d during 2005 as a result of two hurricanes (See Operating Income Production below). Virtually all expenses increased during 2005, on both an absolute and per BOE basis, as we experienced cost increases in almost every aspect of our business, as much as 20% to 30% per annum for certain items. Operating expenses also increased as a result of our increased emphasis on tertiary operations, which have higher operating costs per BOE than our other properties. Nevertheless, during 2005 the high commodity prices more than offset the higher expenses. As has been our practice for several years, we are reinvesting virtually all of our cash flow in new projects, with a desire to (i) further increase our production and reserves, and (ii) keep our balance sheet strong by limiting our exploration and development budget to an amount approximately equal to our cash flow from operations. During 2005, our proved reserves increased from 129.4 MMBOE as of December 31, 2004, to 152.6 MMBOE as of December 31, 2005, replacing approximately 313% of our 2005 production, over 85% of which was from internal organic growth and the balance from acquisitions. Net income for 2005 was $166.5 million, approximately double 2004 net income of $82.4 million and nearly a three fold increase over 2003 net income of $56.6 million. Lower expense on our commodity hedges improved our net income. We paid out approximately $16.8 million during 2005 as compared to $84.6 million during 2004 and $62.2 million during 2003 in settlement payments on our commodity hedges (see Market Risk Management). As our financial position has improved over the last few years, we have generally hedged less, thus reducing our out of pocket cash payments, even though commodity prices have continued to increase. Stock split. On October 19, 2005, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase our authorized shares of common stock from 100 million shares to 250 million shares and to split our common stock on a two for one basis. Stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 31, 2005, received one additional share of Denbury common stock for each share of common stock held at that time. All per share numbers for all periods included herein have been restated for this two for one split. 2004 sale of offshore operations. On July 20, 2004, we closed the sale of Denbury Offshore, Inc., a subsidiary that held our offshore assets, for approximately $187 million (after sale adjustments). Our offshore properties made up approximately 12% of our year end 2003 proved reserves (approximately 96 Bcfe as of December 31, 2003) and represented approximately 25% (9,114 BOE/d) of our 2004 second quarter production. 28 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Recent Acquisitions On January 31, 2006, we completed an acquisition of three producing oil properties that are future potential CO2 tertiary oil flood candidates: Tinsley Field approximately 40 miles northwest of Jackson, Mississippi; Citronelle Field in Southwest Alabama, and the smaller South Cypress Creek Field near the Companys Eucutta Field in Eastern Mississippi. We expect to begin our initial tertiary development work at Tinsley Field during 2006 with more extensive development planned for 2007. The timing of tertiary development at Citronelle Field is uncertain as we will need to build a 60 to 70 mile pipeline extension of our CO2 line to East Mississippi before flooding can commence, and South Cypress Creek will probably be flooded following our initial development of our other East Mississippi properties. See CO2 Operations for further information regarding our CO2 operations. The preliminary adjusted purchase price for these three properties was approximately $248 million, after adjusting for interim net cash flow and minor purchase price adjustments. The acquisition was funded with proceeds of the $150 million of senior subordinated notes issued in December 2005 and bank financing under the Companys existing credit facility, bringing the outstanding balance of the Companys bank debt as of January 31, 2006, to approximately $100 million. These three fields are currently producing approximately 2,200 BOE/d net to the acquired interests, and have proved reserves of approximately 14.4 million BOEs. We operate all three fields and own the majority of the working interest. During 2005, we reached an agreement with Southern Natural Gas Company to acquire a 102 mile natural gas pipeline that runs from Gwinville Field in Central Mississippi to near Lake St. John Field, near the Louisiana/Mississippi border. This pipeline crosses our existing 20 CO2 pipeline in Southwest Mississippi and will allow us to transport CO2 to two oil fields we acquired during 2005, Lake St. John and Cranfield Fields. The purchase price and associated anticipated remediation work is estimated at approximately $5.2 million. Closing of the acquisition is subject to regulatory approval, which may take up to six months. Prior to converting the pipeline to CO2 service, a smaller 17 mile natural gas pipeline will need to be constructed to replace natural gas service to the local communities currently being serviced by the pipeline. Capital Resources and Liquidity Our current capital budget for 2006, excluding any potential acquisitions, is approximately $494 million, which at commodity futures prices as of mid February appears to be slightly more than our anticipated cash flow from operations. As has been our practice in the past, we attempt to reinvest all of our available cash flow from operations to find additional reserves and increase production. We monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis, adjusting them up or down depending on commodity prices and the resultant cash flow. Therefore, during the last few years as commodity prices have increased, we have increased our capital budget throughout the year. As a result of the recent cost inflation in our industry, many of our recent budget increases have related to escalating costs rather than additional projects. In this inflationary environment, we often have to either increase our capital budget or consider the elimination of a portion of our planned projects. We anticipate that we would fund any minor differences between our capital budget and cash flow from operations with bank debt, but if the difference becomes significant, we would likely postpone some of our projects. As of February 28, 2006, we had approximately $100 million of unused borrowing base on our bank credit line, which in our opinion could be significantly expanded if desired. We plan to spend approximately 50% of our capital budget on tertiary related projects and approximately 25% in the Barnett Shale area, with the balance split almost equally between our other operating areas. Although we now control most of the fields along our existing CO2 pipeline in Southwest Mississippi, there are several fields in East Mississippi that could be acquired to further expand our planned tertiary operations there, plus we are continuing to seek additional interests in the fields that we currently own. Further, we would like to add additional phases or areas of tertiary operations by acquiring other old oil fields in other parts of our region of operations, building a CO2 pipeline to those areas and initiating additional tertiary floods. The purchase price of these potential tertiary fields can vary widely, depending on the level of existing production and conventional oil reserves, making it impractical to forecast our acquisition expenditures. We would likely fund any acquisitions with debt, supplemented as we feel necessary with equity. Although we are comfortable with our existing debt levels, they are higher than they have been the last couple of years because we funded the recently closed $248 million property acquisition (see Recent Acquisitions) with debt. Since it is our desire to maintain a strong financial position, it is unlikely that we will 29 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations increase our debt levels by any significant amount in the near future other than on a temporary basis, and we have not eliminated the possibility of issuing equity to reduce part, or all, of the bank debt incurred for the recent acquisition. We could also generate cash, if desired, by refinancing our essentially completed $50 million CO2 pipeline to East Mississippi, recouping our expended capital and instead paying for the cost of the pipeline over time. With our current credit availability and other options that we believe are available to us, we do not anticipate having any liquidity issues in the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding $225 million (principal amount) of 7.5% subordinated notes due 2013, $150 million (principal amount) of 7.5% subordinated notes due 2015, approximately $9.4 million of capital lease commitments, no bank debt, and working capital of $145.1 million. We borrowed $100 million on our bank line at the end of January and used available cash to fund the $248 million acquisition, which closed on January 31, 2006. Sources and Uses of Capital Resources During 2005, we spent $292.8 million on oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditures, $76.8 million on CO2 exploration and development expenditures (including approximately $46.0 million for our CO2 pipeline to East Mississippi), and approximately $70.9 million on property acquisitions, for total capital expenditures of approximately $440.5 million. Our exploration and development expenditures included approximately $147.8 million spent on drilling, $25.5 million of geological, geophysical and acreage expenditures and $135.1 million spent on facilities and recompletion costs. Our 2005 acquisition expenditures include the purchase of additional interest and acreage in the Barnett Shale area and purchase of two oil fields, Cranfield and Lake St. John Fields, which may be potential tertiary flood candidates in the future. Our $440.5 million of capital expenditures included an increase of $18.2 million in our accrued capital expenditures, with the remaining cash portion of our capital expenditures funded primarily with $361.0 million of cash flow from operations and approximately $57 million of short term investments remaining at December 31, 2004, from the sale of our offshore properties during 2004. Additionally, we issued $150 million of subordinated debt in December 2005 and raised $14.4 million during 2005 from the sale of another volumetric production payment of CO2 to Genesis Energy, L.P. (Genesis), along with a related long term CO2 supply agreement with an industrial customer. All of these sources not only funded our capital expenditures, but also increased our cash balance at year end to $165.1 million, with a portion of such funds used in January 2006 to partially fund the $248 million acquisition. Adjusted cash flow from operations (a non GAAP measure defined as cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities as discussed below under Results of Operations Operating Results below) was $343.4 million for 2005, while cash flow from operations for the same period, the GAAP measure, was $361.0 million. During 2004, we spent $167.0 million on oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditures, $42.4 million on CO2 exploration and development expenditures, and approximately $18.9 million on property acquisitions, for total capital expenditures of approximately $228.3 million. Our exploration and development expenditures included approximately $138.9 million spent on drilling, $18.9 million of geological, geophysical and acreage expenditures and $51.6 million spent on facilities and recompletion costs. We funded these expenditures with $168.7 million of cash flow from operations, with the balance funded with net proceeds from the sale of our offshore properties. We paid back all of our bank debt during the third quarter of 2004 with the offshore sale proceeds, leaving us with approximately $33.0 million of cash and $57.2 million of short term investments as of December 31, 2004. We also raised $4.8 million during the third quarter of 2004 from the sale of another volumetric production payment of CO2 to Genesis, along with a related long term CO2 supply agreement with an industrial customer. Adjusted cash flow from operations (a non GAAP measure defined as cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities as discussed below under Results of Operations Operating Results) was $200.2 million for 2004, while cash flow from operations, the GAAP measure, was $168.7 million. During 2003, we generated approximately $197.6 million of cash flow from operations and generated an additional $29.4 million of cash from sales of oil and gas properties. The largest single asset sale was the sale of Laurel Field, acquired from COHO in August 2002, which netted us approximately $25.9 million. Later in the year, we also sold a volumetric production payment to Genesis, which netted us approximately $23.9 million of cash. During 2003, we spent $146.6 million on oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditures, $22.7 million on CO2 capital investments and acquisitions, and approximately $11.8 million on oil and natural gas property acquisitions, for total capital expenditures of approximately $181.1 million. Our exploration and development expenditures included approximately $115.3 million spent on drilling, $15.7 million of geological, geophysical and acreage expenditures and $35.2 million spent on facilities and recompletion costs. In addition, 30 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations during 2003 we incurred approximately $15.6 million of costs to refinance our previously outstanding subordinated debt. The $147.3 million of net total expenditures (including the $15.6 million of debt refinancing costs but net of property sales proceeds) was funded by our cash flow from operations, with the balance used to reduce our total debt by approximately $50.0 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Commitments and Obligations We have no off balance sheet arrangements, special purpose entities, financing partnerships or guarantees, other than as disclosed in this section. We have no debt or equity triggers based upon our stock or commodity prices. Our dollar denominated obligations that are not on our balance sheet include our operating leases, which at year end 2005 totaled $37.2 million relating primarily to the lease financing of certain equipment for CO2 recycling facilities at our tertiary oil fields. We also have several leases relating to office space and other minor equipment leases. Additionally, we have dollar related obligations that are not currently recorded on our balance sheet relating to various obligations for development and exploratory expenditures that arise from our normal capital expenditure program or from other transactions common to our industry. In addition, in order to recover our undeveloped proved reserves, we must also fund the associated future development costs forecasted in our proved reserve reports. For a further discussion of our future development costs and proved reserves, see Results of Operations Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization below. At December 31, 2005, we had a total of $460,000 outstanding in letters of credit. Genesis Energy, Inc., our 100% owned subsidiary that is the general partner of Genesis, has guaranteed the bank debt of Genesis, which consists of $10.1 million in letters of credit at December 31, 2005. There were no guarantees by Denbury or any of its other subsidiaries of the debt of Genesis or of Genesis Energy, Inc. at December 31, 2005. We do not have any material transactions with related parties other than sales of production, transportation arrangements, and capital leases with Genesis made in the ordinary course of business, and volumetric production payments of CO2 (VPP) sold to Genesis as discussed in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. A summary of our obligations is presented in the following table: Payments Due by Period Amounts in Thousands Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Subordinated debt (a) $ 375,000 $ $ $ $ $ $ 375,000 Estimated interest payments on subordinated debt (a) 234,262 28,125 28,125 28,125 28,125 28,125 93,637 Operating lease obligations 37,236 6,971 6,959 6,812 5,931 4,392 6,171 Capital lease obligations(b) 9,411 1,185 1,185 1,185 1,185 1,185 3,486 Capital expenditure obligations (c) 90,682 43,763 26,249 15,990 4,680 Other long term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet: Derivative liabilities (d) 10,458 2,774 3,706 3,978 Other Cash Commitments: Future development costs on proved oil and gas reserves, net of capital obligations (e) 441,123 203,289 133,229 59,746 16,294 17,119 11,446 Future development cost on proved C02 reserves, net of capital obligations (f) 134,759 24,759 17,000 17,000 76,000 Asset retirement obligations (g) 69,066 1,820 1,057 3,723 455 2,399 59,612 Total $ 1,401,997 $ 312,686 $ 217,510 $ 136,559 $ 56,670 $ 53,220 $ 625,352 (a) These long term borrowings and related interest payments are further discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This table assumes that our long term debt is held until maturity. (b) Represents future minimum cash commitments to Genesis under capital leases in place at December 31, 2005, primarily for transportation of crude oil and CO2. Approximately $3 million of these payments represents interest. 31 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (c) Represents future minimum cash commitments under contracts in place as of December 31, 2005, primarily for drilling rig services and well related costs. As is common in our industry, we commit to make certain expenditures on a regular basis as part of our ongoing development and exploration program. These commitments generally relate to projects that occur during the subsequent several months and are usually part of our normal operating expenses or part of our capital budget, which for 2006 is currently set at $494 million. In addition, we have recurring expenditures for such things as accounting, engineering and legal fees, software maintenance, subscriptions, and other overhead type items. Normally these expenditures do not change materially on an aggregate basis from year to year and are part of our general and administrative expenses. We have not attempted to estimate these types of expenditures in this table as most could be quickly cancelled with regard to any specific vendor, even though the expense itself may be required for ongoing normal operations of the Company. (d) Represents the estimated future payments under our derivative obligations based on the futures market prices as of December 31, 2005. These amounts will change as oil and natural gas commodity prices change. The estimated fair market value of our oil and natural gas commodity derivatives at December 31, 2005, was a $9.4 million liability. See further discussion of our derivative contracts and their market price sensitivities in Market Risk Management below in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (e) Represents projected capital costs as scheduled in our December 31, 2005 proved reserve report that are necessary in order to recover our proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves. These are not contractual commitments and are net of any other capital obligations shown above. (f) Represents projected capital costs as scheduled in our December 31, 2005 proved reserve report that are necessary in order to recover our proved undeveloped reserves for our CO2 source wells used to produce CO2 for our tertiary operations. These are not contractual commitments and are net of any other capital obligations shown above. (g) Represents the estimated future asset retirement obligations on an undiscounted basis. The discounted asset retirement obligation of $27.1 million, as determined under SFAS No. 143, is further discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long term contracts require us to deliver CO2 to our industrial CO2 customers at various contracted prices, plus we have a CO2 delivery obligation to Genesis pursuant to three volumetric production payments (VPP) entered into during 2003, 2004 and 2005. Based upon the maximum amounts deliverable as stated in the contracts and the volumetric production payments, we estimate that we may be obligated to deliver up to 390 Bcf of CO2 to these customers over the next 18 years; however, since the group as a whole has historically taken less CO2 than the maximum allowed in their contracts, based on the current level of deliveries, we project that our commitment would likely be reduced to approximately 264 Bcf. The maximum volume required in any given year is approximately 113 MMcf/d, although based on our current level of deliveries, this would likely be reduced to approximately 74 MMcf/d. Given the size of our proven CO2 reserves at December 31, 2005 (approximately 4.6 Tcf before deducting approximately 237.1 Bcf for the three VPPs), our current production capabilities and our projected levels of CO2 usage for our own tertiary flooding program, we believe that we will be able to meet these delivery obligations. Results of Operations CO2 Operations Overview. Our interest in tertiary operations has increased to the point that approximately 50% of our 2005 expenditures and 2006 capital budget are dedicated to tertiary related operations. We particularly like this play as (i) it is lower risk and more predictable than most traditional exploration and development activities, (ii) it provides a reasonable rate of return at relatively low oil prices (generally in the twenties, depending on the specific field and area), and (iii) we have virtually no competition for this type of activity in our geographic area. Generally, from East Texas to Florida, there are no known significant natural sources of carbon dioxide except our own, and these large volumes of CO2 that we own drive the play. We talk about our tertiary operations by labeling operating areas or groups of fields as phases. Phase I is in Southwest Mississippi and includes several fields along our 183 mile CO2 pipeline that we acquired in 2001. The most significant fields in this area are Little Creek, Mallalieu, McComb and Brookhaven. Phase II, which we are just starting with the completion of our CO2 pipeline to East Mississippi, includes Eucutta, Soso, Martinville and Heidelberg Fields. With the properties acquired in our recent acquisition that closed in January 2006 (see Recent Acquisitions above), we have labeled the planned operations at Tinsley Field, Northwest of Jackson Dome, as 32 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Phase III. Phase IV includes Cranfield and Lake St. John Fields, two fields near the Mississippi / Louisiana border west of the fields in Phase I. CO2 Resources. In February 2001, we acquired the sources of CO2 located near Jackson, Mississippi, and a 183 mile pipeline to transport it to our oil fields. Since February 2001, we have acquired two and drilled nine additional CO2 producing wells, significantly increasing our estimated proved CO2 reserves from approximately 800 Bcf at the time of acquisition to approximately 4.6 Tcf as of December 31, 2005, approximately 500 Bcf more than we estimate we need for our existing and currently planned phases of tertiary operations. The estimate of 4.6 Tcf of proved CO2 reserves is based on 100% ownership of the CO2 reserves, of which Denburys net revenue interest ownership is approximately 3.8 Tcf, and is included in the evaluation of proven CO2 reserves prepared by DeGolyer MacNaughton. In discussing the available CO2 reserves, we make reference to the gross amount of proved reserves, as this is the amount that is available both for Denburys tertiary recovery programs and industrial users, as Denbury is responsible for distributing the entire CO2 production stream for both of these uses. We currently estimate that it will take approximately 937 Bcf of CO2 to develop and produce the proved tertiary recovery reserves we have recorded at December 31, 2005. Today, we own every known producing CO2 well in the region, providing us a significant strategic advantage in the acquisition of other properties in Mississippi and Louisiana that could be further exploited through tertiary recovery. As of January 2006, we estimate that we are capable of producing approximately 450 MMcf/d of CO2, over five times the rate that we were capable of producing at the time of our initial acquisition in 2001. We continue to drill additional CO2 wells, with three more wells planned for 2006, in order to further increase our production capacity and potentially increase our proven CO2 reserves. Our drilling activity at Jackson Dome will continue beyond 2006 as our current forecasts for the four planned phases suggest that we will need over 800 MMcf/d of CO2 production by 2011. In addition to using CO2 for our tertiary operations, we sell CO2 to third party industrial users under long term contracts. Most of these industrial contracts have been sold to Genesis along with a volumetric production payment for the CO2. Our average daily CO2 production during 2003, 2004 and 2005 was approximately 170 million, 218 million, and 242 million cubic feet per day, of which approximately 62% in 2003, and 73% in 2004, and 73% in 2005 was used in our tertiary recovery operations, with the balance delivered to Genesis under the volumetric production payments or sold to third party industrial users. We spent approximately $0.16 per Mcf in operating expenses to produce our CO2 during 2005, more than our 2004 annual average of $0.12 per Mcf, primarily due to increased labor, utilities and equipment rental expenses during 2005, coupled with higher royalty expenses because several of our royalties correlate with oil prices. During 2003, we spent approximately $0.15 per Mcf to produce our CO2. Our estimated total cost per thousand cubic feet of CO2 during 2005 was approximately $0.25, after inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense related to the CO2 production, as compared to approximately $0.21 during 2004. Overview of Tertiary Economics. Most of our tertiary operations are economic at oil prices in the twenties, although the economics vary by field. Our costs have escalated during the last few years due to general cost inflation in the industry and this trend is expected to continue. Our inception to date finding and development costs (including future development and abandonment costs) for our tertiary oil fields through December 31, 2005, was approximately $7.50 per BOE. Currently, we forecast that these costs will range from $3 to $11 per BOE over the life of each field, depending on the state of a particular field at the time we begin operations, the amount of potential oil, the proximity to a pipeline or other facilities, etc. Our operating costs for tertiary operations averaged $12.00 per BOE in 2005 and are expected to range from $10 to $15 per BOE over the life of each field, again depending on the field itself. Oil quality is another significant factor that impacts the economics. In Phase I (Southwest Mississippi), the light sweet oil produced from our tertiary operations receives near NYMEX prices, while the average discount to NYMEX for the lower quality oil produced from the fields in Phase II (East Mississippi), some of which we plan to start flooding during 2006, was $9.39 per BOE during 2005, a differential that is significantly higher than historical averages and one that appears to increase as oil prices increase. While these economic factors have wide ranges, our rate of return from these operations has generally been better than our traditional oil and gas operations, and thus our tertiary operations have become our single most important focus area. While it is extremely difficult to accurately forecast future production, we do believe that our 33 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations tertiary recovery operations provide significant long term production growth potential at reasonable rates of return, with relatively low risk, and thus will be the backbone of our Companys growth for the foreseeable future. Although we believe that our plans and projections are reasonable and achievable, there could be delays or unforeseen problems in the future that could delay our overall tertiary development program. We believe that such delays, if any, should only be temporary. Financial Statement Impact of CO2 Operations. The increasing emphasis on CO2 tertiary recovery projects has made, and will continue to make, an impact on our financial results and certain operating statistics. First, there is a significant delay between the initial capital expenditures and the resulting production increases, as these tertiary operations require the building of facilities before CO2 flooding can commence and it usually takes six to twelve months before the field responds (i.e., oil production commences) to the injection of CO2. Further, as we expand to other areas, there will be times when we spend significant amounts of capital before we can recognize any proven reserves as these other areas, for the most part, will require an oil production response to the CO2 injections before any oil reserves can be recorded. Further, even after a field has proven reserves, there will usually be significant amounts of additional capital required to fully develop the field. Secondly, these tertiary projects are usually more expensive to operate than our other oil fields because of the cost of injecting and recycling the CO2 (primarily due to the significant energy requirements to re compress the CO2 back into a liquid state for re injection purposes). As commodity and energy prices increase, so do our operating expenses in these fields. Our operating cost for our tertiary operations during 2005 averaged $12.00 per BOE, as compared to an estimated cost of around $7 to $10 per BOE for a more traditional oil property. We allocate the cost to produce and transport the CO2 between CO2 used in our own oil fields and CO2 sold to commercial users (including obligations covered by the volumetric production payments sold to Genesis). Most of our CO2 operating expenses are allocated to our oil fields and are recorded as lease operating expenses on those fields. Since we expense all of the operating costs to produce and inject our CO2, the operating costs per barrel will generally be higher at the inception of CO2 injection before oil production is realized in a particular field. Our overall operating expenses on a per BOE basis will likely continue to increase as these operations constitute an increasingly larger percentage of our operations. Generally, these higher operating costs are somewhat offset by lower finding and development costs which helps to lower our overall depreciation and depletion rate (see also Overview of Tertiary Economics above). Third, our net oil price relative to NYMEX prices may be affected by the oil produced from our tertiary operations (see Overview of Tertiary Operations above). Currently, all of our current CO2 related oil production is from fields that produce light sweet oil and receive oil prices close to, and sometimes actually higher than, NYMEX prices. However, the oil produced from fields we plan to flood as part of Phase II have recently sold at a significant discount to NYMEX. The relative mix of this production, coupled with changing market conditions for the various types of crude, can cause our NYMEX differentials to fluctuate widely. Analysis of CO2 Tertiary Recovery Operating Activities. We currently have tertiary operations ongoing at Little Creek, Mallalieu, McComb, Smithdale and Brookhaven Fields, as well as various smaller adjacent fields. We project that our oil production from these operations will increase substantially over the next several years as we continue to expand this program by adding additional projects and phases. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 59.8 MMBbls of proven oil reserves related to tertiary operations (50.7 MMBbls of which was in Phase I and the balance in Phase II) and have identified and estimated significant additional oil potential in other fields that we own in this region. We plan to start CO2 injections at three fields in Phase II within the first half of 2006, although we do not expect any material production response until 2007. During 2006, we will also start preliminary development work at Tinsley Field (Phase III) and at Cranfield (Phase IV). Our oil production from our CO2 tertiary recovery activities has steadily increased during the last few years, from 3,970 Bbls/d in 2002 to 9,215 Bbls/d during 2005. Our oil production in the third quarter of 2005 decreased 6% over second quarter 2005 levels primarily as a result of production deferred because of two hurricanes which disrupted our electrical power, forcing us to temporarily shut in our production. Tertiary oil production represented approximately 48% of our total corporate oil production during the fourth quarter of 2005 and approximately 31% of our total corporate production during the same period on a BOE basis. We expect that this tertiary related oil production will continue to increase, although the increases are not always predictable or consistent. Following is a chart with our tertiary oil production by field for 2003, 2004 and by quarter for 2005. 34 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

These delays are caused by various factors: difficulties reentering certain injection wells, which has required that some wells be redrilled; delays in getting certain permits and right of ways; delays caused by the two hurricanes; and a general tightening of available materials and equipment in the industry. Generally, the fields are performing as anticipated, but 2005 tertiary oil production was not quite as high as originally expected because of these delays and the two hurricanes. In addition, the timing of specific well responses is not always possible to accurately forecast, so we could experience variances from our expected long term oil production forecast. In addition to higher energy costs to operate our tertiary recycling facilities related to higher commodity prices, we have experienced general cost inflation during the last few years. We have also leased a portion of our recycling and plant equipment used in our tertiary operations, which further increases operating expenses. Over the last three years we have leased certain equipment that qualify for operating lease treatment representing an underlying aggregate cost of approximately $30.3 million as of December 31, 2005, and we expect to enter into new leases for equipment during 2006 representing additional underlying costs of approximately $30 million. Further, the cost to produce our CO2 increased during 2005 (see CO2 Resources above), all of which resulted in an increase in our tertiary operating cost per BOE from $9.90 per BOE in 2004 to $12.00 per BOE during 2005. The absolute amount of operating expenses related to tertiary operations increased from $19.3 million during 2003 to $24.6 million during 2004 and $40.4 million during 2005. Through December 31, 2005, we had spent a total of $273.5 million on fields currently being flooded (included allocated acquisition costs), and had received $303.5 million in net cash flow (revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures), or net positive cash flow of $30.0 million. The proved oil reserves in our CO2 fields have a PV 10 Value of $1.5 billion, using December 31, 2005, constant NYMEX pricing of $61.04 per Bbl. These amounts do not include the capital costs or related depreciation and amortization of our CO2 producing properties, but do include CO2 source field lease operating costs and transportation costs. Through December 31, 2005, we had a balance of approximately $143.5 million of unrecovered costs for the CO2 assets. CO2 Related Capital Budget for 2006. Tentatively, we plan to spend approximately $45 million in 2006 in the Jackson Dome area with the intent to add additional CO2 reserves and deliverability for future operations. Approximately $105 million in capital expenditures is budgeted in 2006 for our Phase I properties (Southwest Mississippi) and approximately $55 million for Phase II properties (East Mississippi), plus an additional $29 million for properties in Phases III and IV, making our combined CO2 related expenditures just under 50% of our 2006 capital budget. Operating Income Adjusted cash flow from operations (see discussion below regarding this non GAAP measure) and net income have increased each year during the last three years, along with rising commodity prices. Production declined 5% from 2003 to 2004 and approximately 10% from 2004 to 2005, primarily related to the sale of our offshore properties in July 2004 and further impacted by the hurricanes during 2005, but the effect of the deferred production was more than offset by the higher commodity prices. 35 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

Cash flow from operations is the GAAP measure as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In our discussion herein, we have elected to discuss these two components of cash flow provided by operations. Adjusted cash flow from operations, the non GAAP measure, measures the cash flow earned or incurred from operating activities without regard to the collection or payment of associated receivables or payables. We believe that it is important to consider adjusted cash flow from operations separately, as we believe it can often be a better way to discuss changes in operating trends in our business caused by changes in production, prices, operating costs, and related operational factors, without regard to whether the earned or incurred item was collected or paid during that year. We also use this measure because the collection of our receivables or payment of our obligations has not been a significant issue for our business, but merely a timing issue from one period to the next, with fluctuations generally caused by significant changes in commodity prices or significant changes in drilling activity. The net change in assets and liabilities relating to operations is also important as it does require or provide additional cash for use in our business; however, we prefer to discuss its effect separately. For instance, as noted above, during 2003, our accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased as a result of our higher drilling activity level late in the year, particularly offshore, increasing our available cash from operations. During 2004, we had a $31.5 million difference between our adjusted cash flow from operations and our GAAP cash flow from operations. The most significant factor was the transfer of approximately $12.5 million of accrued production receivables relating to our offshore properties that existed as of the closing date to the offshore property purchaser. This reduction in accrued production receivables during 2004 was not considered a collection of receivables for our GAAP cash flow from operations. In addition to the effect of transferred receivables, our other accrued production receivables increased during the year due to the increase in commodity prices, and we reduced our accounts payable and accrued liabilities by approximately $10.5 million as a result of less overall activity as of year end, both of which contributed to the significant difference between our 2004 adjusted cash flow and GAAP cash flow from operations. During 2005, we had a $17.6 million increase to our GAAP cash flow from operations resulting from the net change in assets and liabilities relating to operations. This is primarily due to higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities associated with increased capital spending levels as compared to the prior year. Our accrual for production receivables was higher at the end of 2005 than a year earlier, due to higher oil and natural gas prices, partially offsetting the benefit of higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 36 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

As a result of the sale of our offshore properties in July 2004, total production decreased as listed in the above table. Adjusting for the offshore sale, overall production increased approximately 5% on a BOE/d basis during 2004 and approximately 6% during 2005, anchored by the increased production from our tertiary operations and Barnett Shale play, generally offset by overall declines in our onshore conventional properties in Mississippi and natural gas wells in Louisiana. However, other factors that caused fluctuations between the various periods should also be noted as outlined below. During August and September, 2005, hurricanes Katrina and Rita came ashore, negatively affecting almost all of our existing production. While we did not incur any significant property damage as a result of either storm, we estimate that we deferred approximately 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) of production during the third quarter of 2005 as most of our fields were shut in for periods ranging from several days to a few weeks, primarily because of a lack of power or because of flooding. As a result, production was lower in the third quarter than in the immediately prior quarter in every area of our operations except for the Barnett Shale play in Texas. While almost all of our wells had been returned to production by late October, we estimate that we deferred an additional 500 BOE/d of production in the fourth quarter as a result of the two hurricanes. In the aggregate, the deferred production from the two hurricanes lowered our 2005 average annual production rate by almost 1,100 BOE/d. Most of the non CO2 fields in Mississippi have been on a slight decline during the last few years as a result of normal depletion. Heidelberg Field, our single largest field, which is located in this area, has partially offset this decline, as its production increased from 2003 to 2004, then declined slightly in 2005. Heidelberg production averaged 7,535 BOE/d during 2003, 7,775 BOE/d during 2004, and 7,312 BOE/d during 2005. Most production increases at Heidelberg are attributable to additional natural gas drilling in the Selma Chalk formation as Heidelbergs oil production has been slowly decreasing. Natural gas production at this field averaged 10.3 MMcf/d in 2003, 13.8 MMcf/d in 2004, and 14.1 MMcf/d in 2005, making Heidelberg Field our single largest natural gas producing field during 2005. As more fully discussed in CO2 Operations above, oil production from our tertiary operations has increased each year. While our onshore Louisiana annual production average is less in 2005 than in 2004, as a result of drilling 19 38 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations successful wells during 2005 (including wells completed in January 2006), production increased in Louisiana during the fourth quarter of 2005 as compared to the prior quarters. As a result, we expect our 2006 average production in Louisiana to be higher than in 2005. Production in this area, predominately natural gas, is relatively short lived in nature and can decline rapidly unless offset by new wells. As an example, Thornwell Field, an onshore Louisiana field, has been particularly volatile, averaging 2,487 BOE/d during 2003, 1,487 BOE/d during 2004, reaching a three year low of 649 BOE/d during the second quarter of 2005, but then increasing to 2,169 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of our drilling two successful wells during 2005. In spite of its short life and volatile production, we have generated a good return on investment at Thornwell, generating $43.5 million of net positive cash flow (operating revenues less operating expenses and capital expenditures) through December 31, 2005, with a remaining PV 10 Value of $132.5 million as of December 31, 2005 (based on SEC proved reserve report at year end 2005 prices). Natural gas production in the Barnett Shale has increased as a result of increased drilling activity in 2004 and 2005 and the acquisition of additional interests during the second quarter of 2005 that added approximately 1.5 MMcf/d of production. These wells are characterized by steep decline rates in their first year of production (as much as 50% to 60%), followed by a gradual leveling off of production and a resultant slow decline rate, giving them an overall long production life. Natural gas production in this area is expected to further increase throughout 2006 as we anticipate drilling 45 to 50 wells in this area during 2006. We currently have four rigs running in this area. Our production for 2005 was weighted toward oil (67%) and we expect a similar weighting toward oil in 2006 due to our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations, unless we make an acquisition that is predominantly natural gas. Oil and Natural Gas Revenues. Our oil and natural gas revenues have increased for each of the last two years, primarily as a result of higher commodity prices, offset in part by lower production as a result of the sale of offshore properties. Between 2004 and 2005, revenues increased by 23%. The overall increase in commodity prices contributed $148.0 million in additional revenues, a 33% increase, partially offset by an overall decrease of $43.7 million (a 10% decrease) related to the 10% lower production volumes. Between 2003 and 2004, revenues increased by 15%. The overall increase in commodity prices contributed $77.8 million in additional revenues, a 20% increase; partially offset by an overall decrease in revenues of $18.5 million (a 5% decrease) related to the 5% lower production volumes. During 2005, we made payments on our derivative contracts of $16.8 million, down from $84.6 million paid out during the prior year. Our 2005 payments related to a natural gas collar, lowering our effective net natural gas price by $0.78 per Mcf. During 2004, we paid out $64.1 million on our oil hedges ($9.10 per Bbl) and $20.4 million ($0.68 per Mcf) on our natural gas hedges relating to swaps and collars we purchased one to two years earlier when commodity prices were lower. About $30.5 million of the hedge payments related to swaps originally put in place to protect the rate of return for the COHO acquisition in August 2002. The payments in 2003 were similar in nature, but slightly less due to lower overall commodity prices. During 2003, we paid out $20.3 million on our oil hedges ($2.95 per Bbl) and $41.9 million ($1.21 per Mcf) on our natural gas hedges on generally the same type of swaps and collars. For 2006, we have hedged a lower percentage of our overall production, so we do not anticipate that our payments on our derivative contracts will reach the levels seen during 2003 and 2004. See Market Risk Management for a further discussion of our derivative activities. Our net oil and natural gas prices have increased each year as outlined in the above table. These prices would have been even higher if our net price would have increased as much as NYMEX prices. During 2004 and continuing into 2005, the discount for our heavier, sour crude (which predominantly applies to our Eastern Mississippi production) increased significantly, lowering our overall net price relative to NYMEX. Our net oil price averaged $3.60 below NYMEX during 2003, increased to $4.91 during 2004, and further increased to $6.33 during 2005. This occurred in spite of our increasing light sweet oil production from our Phase I tertiary operations, which should have improved our overall net price as such crude receives near NYMEX prices and is becoming a higher percentage of our overall production. However, as evident in 2004 and 2005, the oil market is subject to significant and sudden changes and it is difficult to forecast these trends, although our experience indicates that the discount or NYMEX differential for our heavier sour crude increases as NYMEX oil prices increase. During 2003 and 2004, there was less fluctuation in our natural gas prices relative to NYMEX. During both of those years, our net natural gas prices were at, or slightly above, the quoted NYMEX prices, primarily because of 39 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations the high Btu content of our natural gas and the close proximity of our Louisiana natural gas production to Henry Hub. For 2003, we had an average $0.18 premium to NYMEX and for 2004, had a $0.02 premium to NYMEX. During 2005, our natural gas price averaged $0.49 below NYMEX, primarily due to the increasing natural production in the Barnett Shale area, which averaged $1.82 per Mcf below NYMEX. The NYMEX differential in this area appears to increase with higher natural gas prices; plus, the production in this area is growing and is expected to increase again during 2006. Although these factors could change depending on the overall natural gas market, we would expect these factors to gradually reduce our overall net natural gas price relative to NYMEX in the near future. Operating Expenses. Our lease operating expenses increased on both a per BOE basis and in total dollars primarily as a result of (i) our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations (see discussion of those expenses under CO2 Operations above), (ii) general cost inflation in our industry, (iii) increased personnel and related costs, (iv) higher fuel and energy costs to operate our properties, (v) increasing lease payments for certain of our tertiary operating facilities, and (vi) higher workover costs. During 2005, operating costs averaged $9.98 per BOE, up from $7.22 per BOE in 2004 and $7.06 per BOE during 2003. Operating expenses on our tertiary operations increased from $19.3 million in 2003 to $24.6 million during 2004 and $40.4 million during 2005, as a result of the increased tertiary activity level. Tertiary operating expenses were particularly impacted by the higher power and energy costs, higher costs for CO2 and payments on leased facilities and equipment (see CO2 Operations above). We expect this increase in tertiary operating costs to continue and to further increase our cost per BOE as they become a more significant portion of our total production and operations. Workover expenses increased by over $3.5 million during 2005 as compared to 2004, with over one half of the increase relating to costs to repair a mechanical failure on one onshore Louisiana well. Workover expenses were also high in 2003 when we spent $2.8 million on two individually significant workovers relating to mechanical failures of two onshore Louisiana wells, plus several smaller workovers. Production taxes and marketing expenses generally change in proportion to commodity prices and therefore were higher each year along with the increasing commodity prices. The sale of our offshore properties also contributed to the increase in production taxes and marketing expenses on a per BOE basis during 2004 and 2005, as most of our offshore properties were tax exempt. We also recognized incremental transportation expenses paid by us to Genesis as a result of a change in the way we market our crude oil. Beginning in September 2004, we commenced using Genesis as a transporter rather than a purchaser. This incremental transportation cost is approximately $1.0 million per quarter, but is more than offset by higher oil revenue and this change in the way we do business has given us a higher gross margin. General and Administrative Expenses During the last three years, general and administrative (GA) expenses on a per BOE basis have increased from $1.20 per BOE during 2003, to $1.78 per BOE during 2004, to $2.62 per BOE during 2005, increasing even faster than the gross aggregate dollar increases in GA expense as production has declined each year due primarily to the sale of our offshore properties. Year Ended December 31, Amounts in Thousands Except Per BOE and Employee Data 2005 2004 2003 Gross GA expense $ 64,622 $ 53,658 $ 46,031 Operator overhead charges (32,452 ) (28,048 ) (26,823 ) Capitalized exploration expense (5,084 ) (5,072 ) (5,507 ) 27,086 20,538 13,701 State franchise taxes 1,454 923 1,488 Net GA expense $ 28,540 $ 21,461 $ 15,189 Average GA expense per BOE $ 2.62 $ 1.78 $ 1.20 Employees as of December 31 460 380 374 Gross GA expenses increased $11.0 million, or 20%, between 2004 and 2005. This increase is generally attributable to higher compensation costs due to additional employees (80 employees were added during 2005), wage increases and $4.1 million of non cash compensation expense for the amortization of deferred compensation associated with the issuance of restricted stock to officers and directors in 2004 and 2005, as compared to $1.6 40 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations million during 2004 (see below). We also incurred approximately $1.4 million to provide food, water, gasoline, and other essential supplies to our employees and charitable organizations in Mississippi and Louisiana following the hurricanes. In addition, we incurred higher professional service and consultant fees primarily related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance, investigation of hotline reports, and documentation and testing of our new software system that we began using in January 2005, as well as increased maintenance costs as a result of the change to our new software system. These 2005 increases were offset by the absence of approximately $2.4 million of employee severance payments paid in 2004 related to the sale of our offshore properties in July 2004. Gross GA expenses increased $7.6 million, or 17%, between 2003 and 2004. The largest component of the increase was approximately $2.4 million of employee severance payments for the offshore professional and technical staff terminated in conjunction with our offshore property sale. We also incurred additional GA expenses associated with our corporate restructuring in December 2003, compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, the sale of stock by the Texas Pacific Group in March 2004, a provision for potential litigation losses, amortization of restricted stock grants, higher bonus levels for employees than in 2003 due to the strong performance during 2004, and overall increases in most other categories of GA due to general cost inflation. From August 2004 through January 2005, we granted a total of 2.3 million shares of restricted stock to our officers and independent directors, generating deferred compensation expense of approximately $23.6 million, the market value of the shares on the date of grant. Approximately 65% of this restricted stock vests over five years and the balance upon retirement (in addition to vesting upon death, disability or a change of control). We are amortizing the non cash $23.6 million of compensation expense over the five year vesting period and over the projected retirement date vesting period, expensing approximately $1.6 million during 2004 and $4.1 million during 2005. Higher operator overhead recovery charges resulting from the incremental development activity helped to partially offset the increase in gross GA, partially reduced by the impact of the offshore property sale. Our well operating agreements allow us, when we are the operator, to charge a well with a specified overhead rate during the drilling phase and also to charge a monthly fixed overhead rate for each producing well. As a result of the additional operated wells from acquisitions, additional tertiary operations, and drilling activity during the past year, the amount we recovered as operator overhead charges increased by 5% between 2003 and 2004 and 16% between 2004 and 2005. Capitalized exploration costs decreased in 2004 as a result of the personnel reductions in our offshore area related to the property sale and remained essentially flat in 2005 due to additional personnel and related cost increases. The net effect of the increases in gross GA expenses, operator overhead recoveries and capitalized exploration costs was a 41% increase in net GA expense between 2003 and 2004 and a 33% increase between 2004 and 2005. The increase was even higher on a per BOE basis as a result of lower production, primarily related to the offshore property sale.

(2) Includes commitment fees but excludes amortization of debt issue costs. Interest expense for 2005 decreased from 2004 levels primarily due capitalized interest of $1.6 million relating to the construction of our CO2 pipeline to East Mississippi. As a result of the lower production because of the 2004 offshore sale and production deferred as a result of the two hurricanes, interest expense on a per BOE basis was not as positive as it was on an absolute basis. Interest expense for 2004 decreased from 2003 levels primarily due to lower average debt levels as a result of our $50 million reduction in debt during 2003 and the payoff of our bank debt in the third quarter of 2004 with the 41 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations proceeds from our offshore property sale. Our non cash interest expense in 2004 decreased as a result of the subordinated debt refinancing in March 2003, which eliminated the amortization of discount on our old subordinated debt originally issued in 1998, which was higher than the discount and related amortization on our new subordinated debt issue issued in 2003. Interest and other income increased as a result of the cash generated from the offshore property sale. Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization (DDA) Year Ended December 31, Amounts in Thousands, Except Per BOE Data 2005 2004 2003 Depletion and depreciation of oil and natural gas properties $ 88,949 $ 88,505 $ 87,842 Depletion and depreciation of CO2 assets 5,334 4,664 2,542 Asset retirement obligations 1,682 2,408 2,852 Depreciation of other fixed assets 2,837 1,950 1,472 Total DDA $ 98,802 $ 97,527 $ 94,708 DDA per BOE: Oil and natural gas properties $ 8.34 $ 7.54 $ 7.16 CO2 assets and other fixed assets 0.75 0.55 0.32 Total DDA cost per BOE $ 9.09 $ 8.09 $ 7.48 Our proved reserves increased from 128.2 MMBOE as of December 31, 2003, to 129.4 MMBOE as of December 31, 2004, even after adjusting for approximately 16.5 MMBOE of proved reserves, primarily related to the offshore sale that took place in mid 2004. Our proved reserves further increased to 152.6 MMBOE as of December 31, 2005. Reserve quantities and associated production are only one side of the DDA equation, with capital expenditures less accumulated depletion, asset retirement obligations less related salvage value, and projected future development costs making up the remainder of the calculation. We adjust our DDA rate each quarter based on any changes in our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and costs, and thus our DDA rate could change significantly in the future. Our DDA rate on a per BOE basis increased 12% between 2004 and 2005, primarily due to rising costs and increases in capital spending. During 2005, we spent approximately $71.0 million on acquisitions, of which approximately $50.1 million was included in our full cost pool, with the balance becoming part of our unevaluated properties. Due to high commodity prices, the acquisition cost per BOE was around $14.60 per BOE, contributing to the higher DDA rate. In addition, most of our future development cost estimates on our proved undeveloped reserves have been increased to reflect the rising costs in the industry. Our DDA rate on a per BOE basis increased 8% between 2003 and 2004, primarily due to the higher percentage of expenditures on offshore properties during 2003 and the first six months of 2004, which have historically had higher overall finding and development costs, and an increase in certain of our future development cost estimates to reflect the rising costs in the industry. Although the 2004 average DDA rate was similar to the DDA rate of $8.00 per BOE during the fourth quarter of 2003, there were significant fluctuations during the year resulting from the offshore sale (as the sales proceeds were credited to the full cost pool) and upward adjustments in future development costs primarily to reflect cost inflation in the industry. Our DDA rate for our CO2 and other fixed assets increased in 2004 and 2005 as a result of the additional cost incurred drilling CO2 wells during each year and higher associated future development costs, partially offset by an increase in CO2 reserves from 1.6 Tcf as of December 31, 2003, to 2.7 Tcf as of December 31, 2004, to 4.6 Tcf as of December 31, 2005 (100% working interest basis before amounts attributable to Genesis volumetric production payments see CO2 Operations CO2 Resources). As part of the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred, discounted to its present value using our credit adjusted risk free interest rate, with a corresponding capitalized amount. The liability is accreted each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. On an undiscounted basis, we estimated our retirement obligations as of December 31, 2003, to be $82.7 million, with an estimated salvage value of $43.3 million, also on an undiscounted basis. As of December 31, 2004, we estimated our retirement obligations to be $52.1 million ($21.5 million present 42 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations value), with an estimate salvage value of $43.6 million, the decrease related to the sale of our offshore properties in July 2004. As of December 31, 2005, we estimated our retirement obligations to be $69.1 million ($27.1 million present value), with an estimate salvage value of $50.2 million, the increase related to our increased activity and higher cost estimates due to the inflation in our industry. DDA is calculated on the increase to oil and natural gas and CO2 properties, net of estimated salvage value. We also include the accretion of discount on the asset retirement obligation in our DDA expense. Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation. We did not have any full cost pool ceiling test write downs in 2003, 2004 or 2005 and do not expect to have any such write downs in the foreseeable future at current commodity price levels. Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, Amounts in Thousands, Except Per BOE Amounts 2005 2004 2003 Current income tax expense (benefit) $ 27,177 $ 22,929 $ (91 ) Deferred income tax provision 54,393 16,463 26,303 Total income tax provision $ 81,570 $ 39,392 $ 26,212 Average income tax provision per BOE $ 7.50 $ 3.27 $ 2.07 Net effective tax rate 32.9 % 32.3 % 32.7 % Federal tax net operating loss carryforwards $ $ $ 94,955 Total net deferred tax asset (liability) (129,474 ) (71,936 ) (43,539 ) Our income tax provision for 2004 and 2005 was based on an estimated statutory tax rate of 39%, and for 2003 was based on an estimated statutory tax rate of 38%. Our net effective tax rate was lower than our estimated statutory rates due primarily to our enhanced oil recovery (EOR) tax credits we earn related to our tertiary operations and to a lesser degree, to a new manufacturing deduction that became allowable in 2005 for oil and gas producing activities covered by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Our current income tax expense represents anticipated cash payment due to alternative minimum taxes. During the third quarter of 2004, we recognized approximately $21.0 million of current income taxes as a result of the sale of our offshore properties, which was a gain for income tax purposes. The taxes on the offshore sale were primarily alternative minimum taxes as we were able to offset the related regular tax with our net operating loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2005, we had utilized all of our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards, but had an estimated $42.1 million of enhanced oil recovery credits to carry forward. Since the ability to earn additional enhanced oil recovery credits is reduced or even eliminated based on the level of oil prices, we do not expect to earn any EOR credits during 2006 because of the high oil prices during 2005, which we estimate will raise our effective tax rate. We will be able to utilize the EOR credit carryforwards in the future to reduce our cash taxes. If oil prices remain at current levels or increase further in the future, we will not earn any additional EOR credits and once our existing EOR credits are utilized, our cash taxes will also increase. Results of Operations on a per BOE Basis The following table summarizes the cash flow, DDA and results of operations on a per BOE basis for the comparative periods. Each of the individual components is discussed above. 43 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, Per BOE Data 2005 2004 2003 Oil and natural gas revenues $ 50.49 $ 36.88 $ 30.43 Loss on settlements of derivative contracts (1.54 ) (7.01 ) (4.91 ) Lease operating expenses (9.98 ) (7.22 ) (7.06 ) Production taxes and marketing expenses (2.54 ) (1.55 ) (1.17 ) Production netback 36.43 21.10 17.29 CO2 operating margin 0.54 0.41 0.51 General and administrative expenses (2.62 ) (1.78 ) (1.20 ) Net cash interest expense (1.28 ) (1.34 ) (1.61 ) Current income taxes and other (1.50 ) (1.78 ) (0.01 ) Changes in assets and liabilities relating to operations 1.62 (2.63 ) 0.62 Cash flow from operations 33.19 13.98 15.60 DDA (9.09 ) (8.09 ) (7.48 ) Deferred income taxes (5.00 ) (1.37 ) (2.08 ) Non cash derivative adjustments (1.12 ) (0.11 ) 0.28 Changes in assets and liabilities, loss on early retirement of debt, change in accounting principle and other non cash items (2.67 ) 2.43 (1.86 ) Net income $ 15.31 $ 6.84 $ 4.46 Market Risk Management We finance some of our acquisitions and other expenditures with fixed and variable rate debt. These debt agreements expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates. The following table presents the carrying and fair values of our debt, along with average interest rates. We had no bank debt outstanding as of December 31, 2005, but had $100 million outstanding at February 15, 2006. The fair value of the subordinated debt is based on quoted market prices. None of our debt has any triggers or covenants regarding our debt ratings with rating agencies. Maturity Dates Carrying Fair Amounts in Thousands 2006 2010 Value Value Fixed rate debt: Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013, net of discount $ $ 223,591 $ 228,375 (The interest rate on the subordinated debt is a fixed rate of 7.5%.) Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 $ $ 150,000 $ 152,250 (The interest rate on the subordinated debt is a fixed rate of 7.5%.) From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. These contracts have consisted of price floors, collars and fixed price swaps. Historically, we hedged up to 75% of our anticipated production each year to provide us with a reasonably certain amount of cash flow to cover most of our budgeted exploration and development expenditures without incurring significant debt. For 2005 and beyond, we have entered into fewer derivative contracts, primarily because of our strong financial position resulting from our lower levels of debt relative to our cash flow from operations. When we make a significant acquisition, we generally attempt to hedge a large percentage, up to 100%, of the forecasted proved production for the subsequent one to three years following the acquisition in order to help provide us with a minimum return on our investment. As of December 31, 2005, the only derivative contracts we have in place relate to the $248 million acquisition that closed on January 31, 2006, on which we entered into contracts to cover 100% of the estimated proved producing production at the time we signed the purchase and sale agreement. While these derivative contracts related to the acquisition represent less than 6% of our estimated 2006 production, they are intended to help protect our acquisition economics related to the first three years of production from the proved producing reserves that we acquired. These swaps cover 2,200 Bbls/d for 2006 at a price of $59.65 per Bbl; 2,000 Bbls/d for 2007 at a price of $58.93 per Bbl; and 2,000 Bbls/d for 2008 at a price of $57.34 per Bbl. 44 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations All of the mark to market valuations used for our financial derivatives are provided by external sources and are based on prices that are actively quoted. We manage and control market and counterparty credit risk through established internal control procedures that are reviewed on an ongoing basis. We attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies, monitoring procedures, and diversification. For a full description of our derivative contract positions at year end 2005, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2005, we elected to de designate our existing derivative contracts as hedges and to account for them as speculative contracts going forward. This means that any changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion to earnings. During 2005, we amortized the December 31, 2004, balance in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss as that was the remaining life of those contracts. Information regarding our current derivative contract positions and results of our historical derivative activity is included in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2005, our derivative contracts were recorded at their fair value, which was a net liability of approximately $9.4 million, a larger liability than the $4.9 million fair value liability recorded as of December 31, 2004. This change is the result of higher commodity prices, partially offset by the expiration of several of our derivative contracts during 2005 due to the passage of time. During 2005, we recognized total expense related to our hedge contracts of $29.0 million, consisting of $16.8 million cash payments, $4.5 million of expense relating to market to market non cash adjustments, and $7.7 million of expense related to amortization of Other Comprehensive Loss. Based on NYMEX crude oil futures prices at December 31, 2005, we would expect to make future cash payments of $10.5 million on our crude oil commodity derivative contracts. If crude oil futures prices were to decline by 10%, we would expect to receive a payment under our crude oil commodity derivative contracts of $3.9 million, and if futures prices were to increase by 10% we would expect to pay $24.8 million. We did not have any NYMEX natural gas commodity derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2005. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we select certain accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments regarding the application of those policies. Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements. Full Cost Method of Accounting, Depletion and Depreciation and Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Businesses involved in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. We apply the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Another acceptable method of accounting for oil and gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting. In general, the primary differences between the two methods are related to the capitalization of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment. Under the full cost method, all geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool, whereas under the successful efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred. In the assessment of impairment of oil and gas properties, the successful efforts method follows the guidance of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, under which the net book value of assets are measured for impairment against the undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method, the full cost pool (net book value of oil and gas properties) is measured against future cash flows discounted at 10% using commodity prices in effect at the end of the reporting period. The financial results for a given period could be substantially different depending on the method of accounting that an oil and gas entity applies. In our application of full cost accounting for our oil and gas producing activities, we make significant estimates at the end of each period related to accruals for oil and gas revenues, production, capitalized costs and operating expenses. We calculate these estimates with our best available data, which includes, among other things, 45 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations production reports, price posting, information compiled from daily drilling reports and other internal tracking devices and analysis of historical results and trends. While management is not aware of any required revisions to its estimates, there will likely be future adjustments resulting from such things as changes in ownership interests, payouts, joint venture audits, re allocations by the purchaser/pipeline, or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and natural gas industry, many of which will require retroactive application. These types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated or determined and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs. Under full cost accounting, the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom used to perform the full cost ceiling test have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible, including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare the report, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statement disclosures. Over the last four years, Denburys annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately 3% of the previous years estimates and have been both positive and negative. Changes in commodity prices also affect our reserve quantities. For instance, between 2001 and 2002, commodity prices rebounded from the prior years fall, resulting in an increase to our reserve quantities of approximately 3.5 MMBOE. During 2003, 2004 and 2005, the change related to commodity prices was virtually zero, less than in prior years, as prices were relatively high each year end. These changes in quantities affect our DDA rate and the combined effect of changes in quantities and commodity prices impacts our full cost ceiling test calculation. For example, we estimate that a 5% increase in our estimate of proved reserves quantities would have lowered our fourth quarter 2005 DDA rate from $9.80 per Bbl to approximately $9.39 per Bbl and a 5% decrease in our proved reserve quantities would have increased our DDA rate to approximately $10.25 per Bbl. Also, reserve quantities and their ultimate values are the primary factors in determining the borrowing base under our bank credit facility and are determined solely by our banks. There can also be significant questions as to whether reserves are sufficiently supported by technical evidence to be considered proven. In some cases our proven reserves are less than what we believe to exist because additional evidence, including production testing, is required in order to classify the reserves as proven. In other cases, properties such as certain of our potential tertiary recovery projects may not have proven reserves assigned to them primarily because we have not yet completed a specific plan for development or firmly scheduled such development. We have a corporate policy whereby we generally do not book proved undeveloped reserves unless the project has been committed to internally, which normally means it is scheduled within the next one to two years (or at least the commencement of the project is scheduled in the case of longer term multi year projects such as waterfloods and tertiary recovery projects). Therefore, particularly with regard to potential reserves from tertiary recovery (our CO2 operations), there is uncertainty as to whether the reserves should be included as proven or not. We also have a corporate policy whereby proved undeveloped reserves must be economic at long term historical prices, which are usually significantly less than the year end prices used in our reserve report. This also can have the effect of eliminating certain projects being included in our estimates of proved reserves, which projects would otherwise be included if undeveloped reserves were determined to be economic solely based on current prices in a high price environment, as was the case during the last three year ends. (See Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization under Results of Operations above for a further discussion.) All of these factors and the decisions made regarding these issues can have a significant effect on our proven reserves and thus on our DDA rate, full cost ceiling test calculation, borrowing base and financial statements. Asset Retirement Obligations We have significant obligations related to the plugging and abandonment of our oil and gas wells, and the removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage and returning such land to its original condition. SFAS No. 143 requires that we estimate the future cost of this obligation, discount it to its present value, and record a corresponding asset and liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates, including the ultimate expected cost of the obligation, the expected future date of the 46 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations required cash payment, and interest and inflation rates. Revisions to these estimates may be required based on changes to cost estimates, the timing of settlement, and changes in legal requirements. Any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis and an adjustment in our DDA expense in future periods. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our asset retirement obligations. Income Taxes We make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. Our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes, tax credits and prior to year end 2005, net operating loss carryforwards. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns. Further, we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets (primarily our enhanced oil recovery credits). If recovery is not likely, we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover, which would result in an increase to our income tax expense. As of December 31, 2005, we believe that all of our deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet will ultimately be recovered. If our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not probable. A 1% increase in our effective tax rate would have increased our calculated income tax expense by approximately $2.5 million, $1.2 million, and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning our income taxes. Oil and Gas Derivative Contracts We enter into derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with future oil and natural gas production. These contracts have historically consisted of options, in the form of price floors or collars, and fixed price swaps. Under SFAS No. 133, every derivative instrument is required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value. If the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings. If the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (equity) to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective. Prior to 2005, we applied hedge accounting to our commodity derivative contracts, thereby recording a significant portion of the fair value changes to equity instead of income. We recognized losses on ineffectiveness on our hedges of $282,000 for 2003 and $2.7 million for 2004. We measured and computed hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis. If a hedging instrument became ineffective, hedge accounting was discontinued and any deferred gains or losses on the cash flow hedge remained in accumulated other comprehensive income until the periods during which the hedges would have otherwise expired. If we determined it probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument were recognized in earnings immediately. As of January 1, 2005, we abandoned hedge accounting. This means that any changes in the future fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the balance to earnings. While we may experience more volatility in our net income than if we had continued to apply hedge accounting treatment as permitted by SFAS No. 133, we believe that for us the benefits associated with applying hedge accounting do not outweigh the cost, time and effort to comply with hedge accounting. During 2005, we recognized expense of $4.5 million related to changes in the fair market value of our derivative contracts. For our prior two most recently completed fiscal years, if we had not chosen to designate hedge accounting treatment to our oil and natural gas derivative contracts, or if none of our derivative contracts had qualified for hedge accounting treatment, we estimate that our net income would have increased or (decreased) for 2004 and 2003 by approximately $25.0 million and $(7.8 million), respectively. 47 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires us to make other estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reliable and believe that the ultimate actual results will not differ significantly from those reported; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and such risks and uncertainties could cause the actual results to differ materially from our estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB 25 and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on their estimated fair values. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective application method described in the statement. Under the modified prospective method, we will apply the standard to new awards granted or modified effective January 1, 2006. Also, we will recognize compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of December 31, 2005 over the remaining service periods. At January 1, 2006, we had $16.6 million of unearned compensation cost related to unvested stock option awards. This compensation cost will be recognized over the remaining vesting period, which is estimated to be approximately $8.0 million during 2006, $5.2 million during 2007, $3.1 million during 2008 and $0.3 million during 2009. These amounts do not include the impact of any new awards granted in 2006. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires the tax benefits in excess of recognized compensation expenses to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement may serve to reduce Denburys future cash provided by operating activities and increase future cash provided by financing activities, to the extent of associated tax benefits that may be realized in the future; however, it will not have an impact on the Companys overall cash flows. Forward Looking Information The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements found in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are forward looking statements, as that term is defined in Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be or may concern, among other things, forecasted capital expenditures, drilling activity or methods, acquisition plans and proposals and dispositions, development activities, cost savings, production rates and volumes, hydrocarbon reserves, hydrocarbon prices, liquidity, regulatory matters, mark to market values, competition and long term forecasts of production, finding cost, rates of return, estimated costs, future capital expenditures and overall economics and other variables surrounding our tertiary operations and future plans. Such forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as plan, estimate, expect, predict, anticipate, projected, should, assume, believe, target or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Such forward looking information is based upon managements current plans, expectations, estimates and assumptions and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect current plans, anticipated actions, the timing of such actions and the Companys financial condition and results of operations. As a consequence, actual results may differ materially from expectations, estimates or assumptions expressed in or implied by any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are: fluctuations of the prices received or demand for the Companys oil and natural gas, inaccurate cost estimates, fluctuations in the prices of goods and services, the uncertainty of drilling results and reserve estimates, operating hazards, acquisition risks, requirements for capital or its availability, general economic conditions, competition and government regulations, unexpected delays, as well as the risks and uncertainties inherent in oil and gas drilling and production activities or which are otherwise discussed in this annual report, including, without limitation, the portions referenced above, and the uncertainties set forth from time to time in the Companys other public reports, filings and public statements. 48 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
