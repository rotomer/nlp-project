Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We are a growing independent oil and gas company engaged in acquisition, development and exploration activities in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. We are the largest oil and natural gas producer in Mississippi, own the largest carbon dioxide (CO2) reserves east of the Mississippi River used for tertiary oil recovery, and hold significant operating acreage onshore Louisiana, Alabama, and in the Barnett Shale play near Fort Worth, Texas. Our goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling, and proven engineering extraction processes, including secondary and tertiary recovery operations. Our corporate headquarters are in Plano, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), and we have five primary field offices located in Houma, Louisiana; Laurel, Mississippi; McComb, Mississippi; Brandon, Mississippi; and Cleburne, Texas. 2006 Overview Operating results. During 2006, the combination of high commodity prices and record annual production resulted in record annual earnings and cash flow from operations. Production for 2006 averaged 36,782 BOE/d, 23% higher than our average production during 2005, with production increases in every operating area. Commodity prices, on a BOE basis net to us, increased 6% between the fiscal year end 2005 and 2006. Virtually all expenses increased during 2006, on both an absolute and per BOE basis, as we experienced cost increases in almost every aspect of our business. Overall industry costs continue to increase, the primary reason for higher operating costs and depreciation and depletion rates per BOE in 2006. Operating expenses were also impacted by higher energy costs (electrical and fuel charges) and our continuing emphasis on tertiary operations. General and administrative expenses increased 51% between 2005 and 2006 primarily as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) relating to stock compensation and continued growth in personnel and inflation in the industry. Interest expense increased 31% as a result of average debt levels that were 83% higher than in 2005, partially offset by $11.3 million of capitalized interest expense, primarily relating to the unevaluated properties included in our 2006 acquisitions. Our commodity derivative contract mark to market adjustments were the only positive trend in expenses during 2006, wherein we recognized a $19.8 million gain in 2006, as compared to a $29.0 million loss in 2005. Our derivative gain was primarily a result of our decision to enter into natural gas swaps in mid December 2006 covering between 80% and 90% of our forecasted 2007 natural gas production, followed by a decline in natural gas prices by year end. As has been our practice for several years, we are reinvesting virtually all of our cash flow in new projects, with a desire to further increase our production and reserves. During 2006, our proved reserves increased from 152.6 MMBOE as of December 31, 2005 to 174.3 MMBOE as of December 31, 2006, replacing approximately 260% of our 2006 production, over 60% of which was from internal organic growth, with the balance from acquisitions. The most significant reserve additions during 2006 were in the Barnett Shale. We did not recognize many tertiary oil reserve additions during 2006 because of delays in getting projects completed (and the related delays in associated production response) and because of a transition in how proved tertiary oil reserves were being recognized (see Results of Operations Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization for a review of our reserve changes during 2006 and a discussion of our proved tertiary reserves). Net income for 2006 was $202.5 million as compared to $166.5 million for 2005 and $82.4 million for 2004. The incremental net income during the 2006 was attributable to most of the factors noted above, principally higher production, partially offset by higher costs. Continued high commodity prices during 2006 also played a significant role in the 2006 results. In addition to inflationary costs in our industry, we are experiencing more and more delays in obtaining goods and services. This industry trend has caused us to experience higher costs than originally forecasted and to periodically fall behind schedule with regard to the timing of planned activities. While there are preliminary signs that these trends are slowing as a result of the decline in commodity prices in late 2006, unless commodity prices remain flat or continue to decrease, we believe that we are likely to see a resumption of these trends. These rising costs, both for operating expenses and capital expenditures, and shortages of goods and services, contribute to delays in completing our planned projects and may cause delays and shortfalls in achieving our anticipated production and profitability targets. See Results of Operations for a more thorough discussion of our operating results. Continued expansion of our tertiary operations. Since we acquired our first carbon dioxide tertiary flood in Mississippi in 1999, we have gradually increased our emphasis on these types of operations. We particularly like this 29 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations play because of its risk profile, rate of return and lack of competition in our operating area. Generally, from East Texas to Florida, there are no known significant natural sources of carbon dioxide except our own, and these large volumes of CO2 that we own drive the play. Please refer to the section entitled CO2 Operations below for a discussion of these operations, their potential, and the ramifications of our continuing emphasis on these operations. Having enough CO2 to flood our tertiary oil fields is one of the most important ingredients, if not the key ingredient, to our tertiary operations. During 2006 we increased our proved CO2 reserve quantities by 19%, from 4.6 Tcf as of December 31, 2005, to approximately 5.5 Tcf as of December 31, 2006 (both of these quantities are on a working interest basis see CO2 Operations CO2 Resources for further information). We are continuing to buy additional oil fields that are tertiary flood candidates (See 2006 Acquisitions below). 2006 Acquisitions. Tinsley and Citronelle Fields. On January 31, 2006, we completed an acquisition of three producing oil properties that are future potential CO2 tertiary oil flood candidates: Tinsley Field approximately 40 miles northwest of Jackson, Mississippi, Citronelle Field in Southwest Alabama, and the smaller South Cypress Creek Field near the Companys Eucutta Field in Eastern Mississippi. In 2006 we began our tertiary development work at Tinsley Field, consisting primarily of planning, land and engineering work, with more extensive development and facility construction planned for 2007. The timing of tertiary development at Citronelle Field is uncertain as we will need to build a 60 to 70 mile extension of our Free State pipeline (CO2 pipeline from Jackson Dome to East Mississippi) before flooding can commence, and South Cypress Creek will probably be flooded following our initial development of our other East Mississippi properties. The adjusted purchase price for these three properties was approximately $250 million. The acquisition was funded with proceeds of the $150 million of senior subordinated notes issued in December 2005 and $100 million of bank financing under the Companys existing credit facility (repaid in April 2006 with proceeds from our equity offering at that time). During the fourth quarter of 2006, these fields produced an average of 2,569 BOE/d, up slightly from the 2,200 BOE/d at the time of acquisition. As of December 31, 2006, these fields had proved reserves of approximately 13.5 million BOEs. We operate all three fields and own the majority of the working interests. Delhi Field. During May 2006, we purchased the Delhi Holt Bryant Unit (Delhi) in northern Louisiana for $50 million, plus a 25% reversionary interest to the seller after we have achieved $200 million in net operating revenue, as defined. Delhi is also a future potential CO2 tertiary oil flood candidate that will require construction of a CO2 pipeline before flooding can commence, with current plans to make such a line an extension of the larger, new CO2 pipeline currently planned from Jackson Dome to Tinsley Field. Our goal is to have this CO2 line installed by 2008, with initial oil production from tertiary operations currently anticipated during 2009. No significant oil production or proved oil reserves existed at Delhi Field at December 31, 2006. Hastings Field. During November 2006 we entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Venoco, Inc. that gives us an option, between November 1, 2008 and November 1, 2009, to purchase their interest in Hastings Field, a strategically significant potential tertiary flood candidate located near Houston, Texas. The agreement provides for the parties to agree upon a purchase price for the conventional proved reserves at the time of the exercise of the option, which may be paid in cash or through a volumetric production payment; failing an agreement as to price, the price will be determined by a pre designated independent petroleum engineering firm using specified criteria for calculation of the discounted present value of proved reserves at that time. As consideration for the option agreement, we made an upfront payment of $37.5 million and are required to make additional payments totaling $12.5 million over the next twenty months. We can extend the option period beyond November 2009 for up to seven additional years at an incremental cost of $30 million per year. None of the option payment amounts will be credited against the purchase price if we exercise the option. If we exercise the option, we will be committed to make aggregate net capital expenditures in the field of approximately $175 million over the subsequent five years to develop the field for tertiary operations, with an obligation to commence CO2 injections in the field within three years following the option exercise. Hastings Field is currently producing approximately 2,400 Bbls/d, although we currently have no economic interest in this production. We believe that Hastings Field has significant potential oil reserves from tertiary flooding. We plan to build a pipeline to transport CO2 to this field, estimated at between 280 and 300 miles, from the southern end of our existing CO2 pipeline which terminates near Donaldsonville, Louisiana. Based on very preliminary estimates, this pipeline is expected to cost between $450 million and $650 million, although this cost could vary significantly depending on the ultimate size of the pipeline, its pressure rating, its specific route, and other variables, all of which are unknown 30 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations at this time. We are initiating studies related to construction of this line, with a goal of having it installed and operational within the next few years. We anticipate initially transporting CO2 to the Hastings Field from our natural CO2 source at Jackson Dome, but ultimately plan to use manufactured (anthropogenic) sources of CO2 for this tertiary operation. See Results of Operations CO2 Resources for a discussion of an agreement we entered into during 2006 to purchase a man made source of CO2 from a planned petroleum coke gasification project. April 2006 Equity Offering. On April 25, 2006, we closed the $125 million sale (net to Denbury) of 3,492,595 shares of common stock in a public offering. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay then current borrowings under our bank credit facility, which were $120 million as of that date, principally incurred to partially fund our $250 million acquisition of three properties in January 2006. Capital Resources and Liquidity Our current 2007 capital budget is $650 million, excluding any potential acquisitions. Approximately 60% of our 2007 budget is expected to be spent on tertiary related operations, approximately 20% in the Barnett Shale area, and less than 10% on exploration projects, with the balance spent on our conventional properties in Mississippi or Louisiana. This capital program includes an estimated $80 million to $100 million for a CO2 pipeline from our CO2 source at Jackson Dome to Tinsley and Delhi Fields, two oil fields acquired during 2006. Based on futures commodity prices as of the end of January 2007, this budget is $200 million to $250 million greater than our anticipated cash flow from operations, a much greater shortfall than we have had in recent years. Currently, we plan to fund the majority of this shortfall by refinancing our two existing CO2 pipelines with Genesis Energy, L.P. (Genesis) by entering into some type of long term financing or sale transaction, effectively paying for the cost of the pipeline over an extended period of time and recouping our cash previously spent. We would anticipate a similar financing with Genesis for the new CO2 pipeline from Jackson Dome to Tinsley and Delhi Fields once it is completed, forecasted at this time to be during the first half of 2008. We have discussed with Genesis that any such financings are conditioned upon Genesis achieving certain goals, primarily the acquisition of other economic projects that are not related to Denbury, based upon acquisition by Genesis of $1.50 of non Denbury related acquisitions for every $1.00 of financings or sales with Denbury. If Genesis is not successful in acquiring properties from third parties or we cannot reach mutually agreeable terms with Genesis to sell them these CO2 pipeline assets, we would plan to fund the shortfall with conventional debt and could potentially reduce our capital budget later in the year. As of February 16, 2007, we had $150 million of bank debt outstanding on a $500 million borrowing base (see Revised bank credit agreement below), leaving us significant incremental borrowing capacity, more than we currently plan or desire to use. We monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis, adjusting them up or down depending on commodity prices and the resultant cash flow. Therefore, during the last few years as commodity prices have increased, we have increased our capital budget throughout the year. As a result of the recent cost inflation in our industry, many of our recent budget increases have related to escalating costs rather than additional projects. In this inflationary environment, we often have to either increase our capital budget or consider the elimination of a portion of our planned projects. We also continue to pursue additional acquisitions of mature oil fields that we believe have potential as future tertiary flood candidates. These possible acquisitions are difficult to forecast and the purchase price can vary widely depending on the levels in the fields of existing production and conventional proved reserves and commodity prices. Any additional acquisitions would be funded, at least temporarily, with bank or other debt, although if significant, the acquisition would likely be ultimately funded with more permanent capital such as subordinated debt and or additional equity. Revised bank credit agreement. On September 14, 2006, we entered into a Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with our nine banks, led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The new agreement (i) improved the credit pricing under the agreement, (ii) extended the term of the credit arrangements by two and one half years to September 14, 2011, (iii) increased the borrowing base from $300 million to $500 million, (iv) increased the maximum facility size from $300 million to $800 million, and (v) made other minor modifications. Under the new agreement, the commitment amount remained at $150 million, an amount increased in December 2006 to $250 million. The borrowing base represents the amount that can be borrowed from a credit standpoint based on our assets, as confirmed by the banks, while the commitment amount is the amount the banks have committed to fund pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement. The banks have the option to participate in 31 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations any borrowing request by us in excess of the commitment amount ($250 million), up to the borrowing base limit ($500 million), although the banks are not obligated to fund any amount in excess of the commitment amount. At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding $375.0 million (principal amount) of 7.5% subordinated notes, approximately $10.0 million of capital lease commitments, $134.0 million of bank debt, and a working capital deficit of approximately $17.1 million. Sources and Uses of Capital Resources During 2006, we spent $507.3 million on oil and natural gas exploration and development, $63.6 million on CO2 exploration and development, and approximately $319.0 million on property acquisitions, for total capital expenditures of approximately $889.9 million. Our oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditures included approximately $245.3 million spent on drilling, $31.6 million spent on geological, geophysical and acreage expenditures and $230.4 million incurred on facilities and recompletion costs. We funded our total capital expenditures with $461.8 million of cash flow from operations, $125 million of equity, $134 million of net bank borrowings, and a $13.2 million increase in our accrued capital expenditures, with the balance funded with working capital, predominately cash from the December 2005 issuance of $150 million of subordinated debt. Adjusted cash flow from operations (a non GAAP measure defined as cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities as discussed below under Results of Operations Operating Results) was $448.4 million for 2006, while cash flow from operations for the same period, the GAAP measure, was $461.8 million. During 2005, we spent $292.8 million on oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditures, $76.8 million on CO2 exploration and development expenditures (including approximately $46.0 million for our CO2 pipeline to East Mississippi), and approximately $70.9 million on property acquisitions, for total capital expenditures of approximately $440.5 million. Our exploration and development expenditures included approximately $147.8 million spent on drilling, $25.5 million of geological, geophysical and acreage expenditures and $135.1 million spent on facilities and recompletion costs. Our 2005 acquisition expenditures include the purchase of additional interest and acreage in the Barnett Shale area and purchase of two oil fields, Cranfield and Lake St. John Fields, which may be potential tertiary flood candidates in the future. Our $440.5 million of capital expenditures included an increase of $18.2 million in our accrued capital expenditures, with the remaining cash portion of our capital expenditures funded primarily with $361.0 million of cash flow from operations and approximately $57 million of short term investments remaining at December 31, 2004, from the sale of our offshore properties during 2004. Additionally, we issued $150 million of subordinated debt in December 2005 and raised $14.4 million during 2005 from the sale of another volumetric production payment of CO2 to Genesis, along with a related long term CO2 supply agreement with an industrial customer. All of these sources not only funded our capital expenditures, but also increased our cash balance at year end 2005 to $165.1 million, with a portion of such funds used in January 2006 to partially fund our $250 million acquisition. Adjusted cash flow from operations (a non GAAP measure defined as cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities as discussed below under Results of Operations Operating Results below) was $343.4 million for 2005, while cash flow from operations for the same period, the GAAP measure, was $361.0 million. During 2004, we spent $167.0 million on oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditures, $42.4 million on CO2 exploration and development expenditures, and approximately $18.9 million on property acquisitions, for total capital expenditures of approximately $228.3 million. Our exploration and development expenditures included approximately $138.9 million spent on drilling, $18.9 million of geological, geophysical and acreage expenditures and $51.6 million spent on facilities and recompletion costs. We funded these expenditures with $168.7 million of cash flow from operations, with the balance funded with net proceeds from the sale of our offshore properties. We paid back all of our bank debt during the third quarter of 2004 with the offshore sale proceeds, leaving us with approximately $33.0 million of cash and $57.2 million of short term investments as of December 31, 2004. We also raised $4.8 million during the third quarter of 2004 from the sale of another volumetric production payment of CO2 to Genesis, along with a related long term CO2 supply agreement with an industrial customer. Adjusted cash flow from operations (a non GAAP measure defined as cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities as discussed below under Results of Operations Operating Results) was $200.2 million for 2004, while cash flow from operations, the GAAP measure, was $168.7 million. 32 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Commitments and Obligations We have no off balance sheet arrangements, special purpose entities, financing partnerships or guarantees, other than as disclosed in this section. We have no debt or equity triggers based upon our stock or commodity prices. Our dollar denominated payment obligations that are not on our balance sheet include our operating leases, which at year end 2006 totaled $101.4 million (including $71.4 million of equipment costs) relating primarily to the lease financing of certain equipment for CO2 recycling facilities at our tertiary oil fields. We also have several leases relating to office space and other minor equipment leases. Additionally, we have dollar related obligations that are not currently recorded on our balance sheet relating to various obligations for development and exploratory expenditures that arise from our normal capital expenditure program or from other transactions common to our industry. In addition, in order to recover our undeveloped proved reserves, we must also fund the associated future development costs forecasted in our proved reserve reports. For a further discussion of our future development costs and proved reserves, see Results of Operations Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization below. At December 31, 2006, we had a total of $10.5 million outstanding in letters of credit. Genesis Energy, Inc., our 100% owned subsidiary that is the general partner of Genesis, may, as general partner, be a potential guarantor of the bank debt of Genesis, which consists of $8.0 million in debt and $4.6 million in letters of credit at December 31, 2006. There were no guarantees by Denbury or any of its other subsidiaries of the debt of Genesis or of Genesis Energy, Inc. at December 31, 2006. We do not have any material transactions with related parties other than sales of production, transportation arrangements, and capital leases with Genesis made in the ordinary course of business, and volumetric production payments of CO2 (VPP) sold to Genesis as discussed in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. A summary of our obligations at December 31, 2006, is presented in the following table: Payments Due by Period Amounts in Thousands Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Subordinated debt (a) $ 375,000 $ $ $ $ $ $ 375,000 Senior Bank Loan (a) 134,000 134,000 Estimated interest payments on subordinated debt and Senior Bank Loan (a) 246,164 36,634 36,634 36,634 36,634 34,116 65,512 Operating lease obligations 101,378 13,056 12,667 11,857 11,527 10,967 41,304 Capital lease obligations (b) 10,028 1,291 1,291 1,529 1,291 1,291 3,335 Capital expenditure obligations (c) 102,660 66,386 20,284 14,235 1,755 Derivative contracts (receipt) payment (d) (14,726 ) (22,125 ) 7,399 Hastings field purchase option 12,500 7,500 5,000 Other Cash Commitments: Future development costs on proved oil and gas reserves, net of capital obligations (e) 463,707 180,000 141,523 85,490 19,367 9,442 27,885 Future development cost on proved CO2 reserves, net of capital obligations (f) 149,367 31,267 20,000 11,000 87,100 Asset retirement obligations (g) 91,338 1,940 1,130 2,428 5,351 1,509 78,980 Total $ 1,671,416 $ 315,949 $ 245,928 $ 152,173 $ 75,925 $ 202,325 $ 679,116 (a) These long term borrowings and related interest payments are further discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This table assumes that our long term debt is held until maturity. (b) Represents future minimum cash commitments of $8.2 million to Genesis under capital leases in place at December 31, 2006, primarily for transportation of crude oil and CO2, $1.6 million for our office in Laurel, Mississippi, and auto leases for $0.2 million. Approximately $3.0 million of these payments represents interest. (c) Represents future minimum cash commitments under contracts in place as of December 31, 2006, primarily for drilling rig services and well related costs. As is common in our industry, we commit to make certain expenditures on a regular 33 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations basis as part of our ongoing development and exploration program. These commitments generally relate to projects that occur during the subsequent several months and are usually part of our normal operating expenses or part of our capital budget, which for 2007 is currently set at $650 million. In addition, we have recurring expenditures for such things as accounting, engineering and legal fees, software maintenance, subscriptions, and other overhead type items. Normally these expenditures do not change materially on an aggregate basis from year to year and are part of our general and administrative expenses. We have not attempted to estimate the amounts of these types of recurring expenditures in this table as most could be quickly cancelled with regard to any specific vendor, even though the expense itself may be required for ongoing normal operations of the Company. (d) Represents the estimated future payments under our oil and gas derivative contracts based on the futures market prices as of December 31, 2006. These amounts will change as oil and natural gas commodity prices change. The estimated fair market value of our oil and natural gas commodity derivatives at December 31, 2006, was a $15.7 million net asset. See further discussion of our derivative contracts and their market price sensitivities in Market Risk Management below in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (e) Represents projected capital costs as scheduled in our December 31, 2006 proved reserve report that are necessary in order to recover our proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves. These are not contractual commitments and are net of any other capital obligations shown under Contractual Obligations in table above. (f) Represents projected capital costs as scheduled in our December 31, 2006 proved reserve report that are necessary in order to recover our proved undeveloped CO2 reserves from our CO2 source wells used to produce CO2 for our tertiary operations. These are not contractual commitments and are net of any other capital obligations shown above. (g) Represents the estimated future asset retirement obligations on an undiscounted basis. The present discounted asset retirement obligation is $41.1 million, as determined under SFAS No. 143, is further discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The above table does not include the commitment to purchase CO2 from the proposed Faustina plant, if built (see Results of Operations CO2 Resources Man made CO2 sources below) and does not include the commitments related to Hastings Field if the purchase option is exercised by us (see 2006 Acquisitions above), as both obligations are contingent on certain events. The above table does include the remaining $12.5 million due on the Hastings option payment. Long term contracts require us to deliver CO2 to our industrial CO2 customers at various contracted prices, plus we have a CO2 delivery obligation to Genesis pursuant to three volumetric production payments (VPP) entered into during 2003 through 2005. Based upon the maximum amounts deliverable as stated in the industrial contracts and the volumetric production payments, we estimate that we may be obligated to deliver up to 391 Bcf of CO2 to these customers over the next 17 years; however, since the group as a whole has historically taken less CO2 than the maximum allowed in their contracts, based on the current level of deliveries, currently we project that our commitment would likely be reduced to approximately 255 Bcf. The maximum volume required in any given year is approximately 105 MMcf/d, although based on our current level of deliveries, this would likely be reduced to approximately 69 MMcf/d. Given the size of our proven CO2 reserves at December 31, 2006 (approximately 5.5 Tcf before deducting approximately 210.5 Bcf for the three VPPs), our current production capabilities and our projected levels of CO2 usage for our own tertiary flooding program, we believe that we will be able to meet these delivery obligations. Results of Operations CO2 Operations Overview. Our interest in tertiary operations has increased to the point that approximately 60% of our 2007 capital budget is dedicated to tertiary related operations. We particularly like this play as (i) it has a lower risk and is more predictable than most traditional exploration and development activities, (ii) it provides a reasonable rate of return at relatively low oil prices (generally around $30 a barrel at todays cost levels, depending on the specific field and area), and (iii) we have virtually no competition for this type of activity in our geographic area. Generally, from East Texas to Florida, there are no known significant natural sources of carbon dioxide except our own, and these large volumes of CO2 that we own drive the play. We talk about our tertiary operations by labeling operating areas or groups of fields as phases. Phase I is in Southwest Mississippi and includes several fields along our 183 mile CO2 pipeline that we acquired in 2001. The 34 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations most significant fields in this area are Little Creek, Mallalieu, McComb and Brookhaven. Phase II, which began with the early 2006 completion of our CO2 pipeline to East Mississippi, includes Eucutta, Soso, Martinville and Heidelberg Fields. With the properties acquired in our January 2006 acquisition (see 2006 Acquisitions above), we have labeled the planned operations at Tinsley Field, Northwest of Jackson Dome, as Phase III. Phase IV includes Cranfield and Lake St. John Fields, two fields near the Mississippi/Louisiana border located west of the Phase I fields, and Phase V is Delhi Field, a Louisiana field we acquired in 2006, located southwest of Tinsley Field (see 2006 Acquisitions). Ultimately, we also plan to ultimately flood Citronelle Field, another field acquired in 2006, and Hastings Field, a field on which we acquired a purchase option in late 2006. We have not yet labeled these two fields as a specific phase. CO2 Resources. In February 2001, we acquired the CO2 source field located near Jackson, Mississippi, and a 183 mile pipeline to transport it to our oil fields. Since February 2001, we have acquired two producing wells and drilled 11 additional CO2 producing wells, significantly increasing our estimated proved CO2 reserves from approximately 800 Bcf at the time of the 2001 acquisition to approximately 5.5 Tcf as of December 31, 2006, approximately 250 Bcf more than we estimate we need for our existing and currently planned phases of tertiary operations. During 2006, our proven CO2 reserves increased approximately 19%, or 900 Bcf, from 4.6 Tcf to 5.5 Tcf. The estimate of 5.5 Tcf of proved CO2 reserves is based on 100% ownership of the CO2 reserves, of which Denburys net revenue interest ownership is approximately 4.5 Tcf. Both reserve estimates are included in the evaluation of proven CO2 reserves prepared by DeGolyer MacNaughton. In discussing the available CO2 reserves, we make reference to the gross amount of proved reserves, as this is the amount that is available both for Denburys tertiary recovery programs and industrial users, as Denbury is responsible for distributing the entire CO2 production stream for both of these uses. We currently estimate that it will take approximately 850 Bcf of CO2 to develop and produce the proved tertiary recovery reserves we have recorded at December 31, 2006. Today, we own every known producing CO2 well in the region, providing us a significant strategic advantage in the acquisition of other properties in Mississippi and Louisiana that could be further exploited through tertiary recovery. As of January 2007, we estimate that we are capable of producing approximately 470 MMcf/d of CO2, over seven times the rate that we were capable of producing at the time of our initial acquisition in 2001. We continue to drill additional CO2 wells, with three more wells planned for 2007, in order to further increase our production capacity and potentially increase our proven CO2 reserves. Our drilling activity at Jackson Dome will continue beyond 2007 as our current forecasts for the five phases which are specifically planned to date suggest that we will need approximately 1,000 MMcf/d of CO2 production by 2011. In addition to using CO2 for our tertiary operations, we sell CO2 to third party industrial users under long term contracts. Most of these industrial contracts have been sold to Genesis along with the sale of a volumetric production payment for the CO2. Our average daily CO2 production during 2004, 2005 and 2006 was approximately 218 million, 242 million, and 342 million cubic feet per day, of which approximately 73% in 2004, 73% in 2005, and 75% in 2006 was used in our tertiary recovery operations, with the balance delivered to Genesis under the volumetric production payments or sold to third party industrial users. We spent approximately $0.19 per Mcf in operating expenses to produce our CO2 during 2006, more than our 2005 average of $0.16 per Mcf, principally as a result of higher oil commodity prices, which results in higher royalty payments, and higher labor, utilities and equipment rental expense. During 2004, we spent approximately $0.12 per Mcf to produce our CO2. Our estimated total cost per thousand cubic feet of CO2 during 2006 was approximately $0.28, after inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense related to the CO2 production, as compared to approximately $0.25 during 2005. Man Made CO2 sources. We entered into an agreement and committed to purchase (if the plant is built) 100% of the CO2 production from a man made (anthropogenic) source of CO2, a planned petroleum coke gasification project scheduled to be completed in 2010. This Faustina plant, proposed to be located near Donaldsonville, LA, will convert petroleum coke into ammonia. As a byproduct of the combustion, large quantities of CO2 will be produced, estimated to be around 200 MMcf/d. We plan to use this CO2 in our tertiary operations program to recover oil. The Faustina agreement allows us to add the potential equivalent volume of an additional one Tcf of CO2 over the term of our contract. Construction of this plant has not yet begun, so we are not certain whether this plant will be built, although it currently appears likely. We are in discussions with several other entities that are considering other types of coal or petroleum coke gasification plants. The cost of this man made CO2 will 35 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations likely be higher than CO2 from our natural source, but the location of these plants could mitigate some of the incremental cost of transporting CO2 from Jackson Dome. Further, we see these sources as a possible expansion of natural sources, assuming they are economical, and we believe that our potential ability to tie these sources together with pipelines will give us a significant advantage over our competitors in our geographic area in acquiring additional oil fields and in acquiring these future potential man made sources of CO2. Overview of Tertiary Economics. Initially, our tertiary operations were economic at oil prices below $20 per Bbl, although the economics have always varied by field. Our costs have escalated during the last few years due to general cost inflation in the industry, raising our current economic oil price to around $30 per Bbl, again dependent on the specific field. Our inception to date finding and development costs (including future development and abandonment costs but excluding expenditures on fields without proven reserves) for our tertiary oil fields through December 31, 2006, are approximately $8.50 per BOE. Currently, we forecast that these costs will range from $5 to $10 per BOE over the life of each field, depending on the state of a particular field at the time we begin operations, the amount of potential oil, the proximity to a pipeline or other facilities, etc. Our operating costs for tertiary operations are expected to range from $13 to $15 per BOE over the life of each field (at todays prices), again depending on the field itself, however, our 2006 operating costs were in excess of this range. Oil quality is another significant factor that impacts the economics. In Phase I (Southwest Mississippi), the light sweet oil produced from our tertiary operations receives near NYMEX prices, while the average discount to NYMEX for the lower quality oil produced from the fields in Phase II (East Mississippi), some of which we started flooding during 2006, was $13.51 per BOE during 2006, a differential that is significantly higher than our corporate historical averages and one that appears to increase as oil prices increase. See Oil and Natural Gas Revenues below for a further discussion of our NYMEX differentials. While these economic factors have wide ranges, our rate of return from these operations has generally been better than our rate of return on traditional oil and gas operations, and thus our tertiary operations have become our single most important focus area. While it is extremely difficult to accurately forecast future production, we do believe that our tertiary recovery operations provide significant long term production growth potential at reasonable rates of return, with relatively low risk, and thus will be the backbone of our Companys growth for the foreseeable future. Although we believe that our plans and projections are reasonable and achievable, there could be delays or unforeseen problems in the future that could delay or affect the economics of our overall tertiary development program. We believe that such delays or price effects, if any, should only be temporary. Financial Statement Impact of CO2 Operations. Our increasing emphasis on CO2 tertiary recovery projects has significantly impacted, and will continue to impact on our financial results and certain operating statistics. First, there is a significant delay between the initial capital expenditures and operating expenses and the resulting production increases, as we must build facilities before CO2 flooding can commence, and it usually takes six to 12 months before the field responds to the injection of CO2 (i.e., oil production commences) to the injection of CO2. Further, we may spend significant amounts of capital before we can recognize any proven reserves from fields we flood (See Analysis of Tertiary Recovery Operations below). Even after a field has proven reserves, there will usually be significant amounts of additional capital required to fully develop the field. Secondly, these tertiary projects are usually more expensive to operate than our other oil fields because of the cost of injecting and recycling the CO2 (primarily due to the significant energy requirements to re compress the CO2 back into a near liquid state for re injection purposes). As commodity and energy prices increase, so do our operating expenses in these fields. Our operating cost during 2006 for our tertiary operations averaged $17.69 per Bbl for our producing tertiary fields, as compared to an estimated cost of around $12 to $15 per BOE for a more traditional oil property. We allocate the cost to produce and transport the CO2 between CO2 used in our own oil fields and CO2 sold to commercial users (including obligations covered by the volumetric production payments sold to Genesis). Most of our CO2 operating expenses are allocated to our oil fields and recorded as lease operating expenses on those fields at the time the CO2 is injected. Since we expense all of the operating costs to produce and inject our CO2, the operating costs per barrel will be higher at the inception of CO2 injection projects before oil production is realized in a particular field. Our total corporate operating expenses on a per BOE basis will likely continue to increase as these operations constitute an increasingly larger percentage of our operations. Generally, these higher operating costs are somewhat offset by lower finding and development costs which helps to lower our overall depreciation and depletion rate (see also Overview of Tertiary Economics above). 36 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Third, our net oil price relative to NYMEX prices may be affected by the oil produced from our tertiary operations (see Overview of Tertiary Operations above). Currently, all of our current oil production from tertiary operations is from fields that produce light sweet oil and receive oil prices close to, and sometimes actually higher than, NYMEX prices. However, the oil produced from fields that we recently commenced flooding as part of Phase II generally sell at a significant discount to NYMEX because of the quality of the crude oil there. The relative mix of this production, coupled with changing market conditions for the various types of crude, can cause our NYMEX differentials to fluctuate widely. Analysis of CO2 Tertiary Recovery Operating Activities. We currently have tertiary operations ongoing at Little Creek, Mallalieu, McComb and Brookhaven Fields in Phase I and Soso, Martinville and Eucutta Fields in Phase II, as well as in various smaller adjacent fields. We project that our oil production from these operations will increase substantially over the next several years as we continue to expand this program by adding additional projects and phases. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 62.2 MMBbls of proven oil reserves related to tertiary operations (51.7 MMBbls of which was in Phase I and the balance in Phase II) and have identified and estimate significant additional oil potential in other fields that we own in this region. We initiated CO2 injections at Tinsley Field (Phase III) in January 2007, although in very limited amounts, with more significant development expected there when the CO2 pipeline to Tinsley is completed, which we currently anticipate in the third or fourth quarter of 2007. We also expect to initiate flooding at Cranfield and Lockhart Crossing Fields in the second half of 2007 (Phase IV). With regard to our proven tertiary reserves, 2006 was a transition year for us, as we added only 6.0 MMBbls of tertiary related proved oil reserves during the year, primarily incremental oil reserves at McComb and Mallalieu Fields (both Phase I). Previously, we booked most proven tertiary oil reserves near the start of a project as almost all the oil fields in Phase I were analogous to Little Creek Field (our first flood) and thus it was not necessary to have an oil production response to the CO2 injections before they were considered proven. Conversely, our new floods (after Phase I) are not analogous (for the most part), as the tertiary floods will be in different geological formations. Therefore for these new phases, there must be an oil production response to the CO2 injections before we can recognize proven oil reserves, even though we believe that these formations have a similar risk profile. Since many of our Phase II projects were delayed during 2006, the production response needed to record any significant incremental tertiary oil reserves in this new area did not take place. We anticipate booking significant amounts of proven tertiary oil reserves during 2007 and beyond, although the magnitude will depend on our progress with Phases III and IV, two areas we plan to initiate during 2007, and the response from our new Phase II projects. Our average annual oil production from our CO2 tertiary recovery activities has increased during the last few years, from 3,970 Bbls/d in 2002 to 10,070 Bbls/d during 2006. Tertiary oil production represented approximately 44% of our total corporate oil production during 2006 and approximately 27% of our total corporate production of both oil and natural gas during the same period on a BOE basis. We expect that this tertiary related oil production will continue to increase, although the increases are not always predictable or consistent. During 2006, our CO2 injections were less than we forecasted due to a series of different types of delays in obtaining equipment or completing facilities, resulting in a corresponding shortfall between our forecasted and actual tertiary oil production. These delays are caused by various factors: difficulties reentering certain injection wells, which has required that some wells be redrilled; delays in getting certain permits and right of ways; and a general tightening of available materials and equipment in the industry. This temporary fluctuation in oil production does not indicate any issue with the proved and potential oil reserves recoverable with CO2, because the historical correlation between oil production and CO2 injections remains high. For our tertiary oil production, we anticipate a 40% to 50% increase in our average production rates for 2007 as compared to 2006 levels. A detailed discussion of each of our tertiary oil fields and the development of each is included on pages 7 9 under Our Tertiary Oil Fields with Proven Tertiary Reserves. Following is a chart with our tertiary oil production by field for 2004, 2005 and by quarter for 2006. 37 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

We also lease a portion of our recycling and plant equipment used in our tertiary operations, which further increases operating expenses. Over the last four years we have leased certain equipment that qualifies for operating lease treatment representing an underlying aggregate cost of approximately $71.4 million as of December 31, 2006. We expect to enter into new leases for equipment during 2007 and 2008 representing additional underlying costs of approximately $44 million. These leases have been an attractive cost of financing due to their low imputed interest rates, which are fixed for seven to ten years. During 2006, the cost to produce our CO2 also increased (see CO2 Resources above), all of which resulted in an increase in our tertiary operating cost per BOE from $12.00 per BOE in 2005 to $17.69 per BOE during 2006. Included in the 2006 amount is approximately $7.5 million, or approximately $2.04 per BOE, for operating expenses at three new tertiary floods in Phase II where we commenced operations but have had only a very limited or no production response to date (initial response is expected late in 2007). The absolute amount of operating expenses related to tertiary operations increased from $24.6 million during 2004 to $40.4 million during 2005 to $65.0 million during 2006. Through December 31, 2006, we spent a total of $665.4 million on fields currently being flooded (including allocated acquisition costs) and received $472.2 million in net cash flow (revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures). Of this total, approximately $273.5 million was spent on fields which had little or no proved reserves at December 31, 2006 (i.e., significant incremental proved reserves are anticipated during 2007 and beyond). The proved oil reserves in our CO2 fields have a PV 10 Value of $1.46 billion, using December 31, 2006 constant NYMEX pricing of $61.05 per Bbl. These amounts do not include the capital costs or related depreciation and amortization of our CO2 producing properties, but do include CO2 source field lease operating costs and transportation costs. Through December 31, 2006, we had a balance of approximately $198.7 million of unrecovered net cash flows for our CO2 assets. CO2 Related Capital Budget for 2007. Tentatively, we plan to spend approximately $70 million in 2007 in the Jackson Dome area with the intent to add additional CO2 reserves and deliverability for future operations. Approximately $60 million in capital expenditures is budgeted in 2007 for our Phase II properties (East Mississippi) and approximately $200 million for Phase III properties (Tinsley), plus an additional $70 million for properties in other phases, making our combined CO2 related expenditures just over 60% of our $650 million 2007 capital budget. Operating Results Adjusted cash flow from operations (see discussion below regarding this non GAAP measure) and net income have increased each year during the last three years, along with rising commodity prices. Production declined 10% from 2004 to 2005, primarily related to the sale of our offshore properties in July 2004 and to a lesser extent due to the hurricanes during 2005, but the effect of this deferred production was more than offset by higher commodity prices in 2005. Production increased 23% between 2005 and 2006, which, coupled with high prices, resulted in record annual net income and cash flow. Included in our 2006 net income is the effect of approximately $7.5 million of non cash charges related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) as of January 1, 2006, relating to certain stock based compensation that was previously only reflected as a footnote disclosure and not recorded in the financial statements (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and approximately $6.0 million of other 38 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

Cash flow from operations is the GAAP measure as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In our discussion herein, we have elected to discuss these two components of cash flow provided by operations. Adjusted cash flow from operations, the non GAAP measure, measures the cash flow earned or incurred from operating activities without regard to the collection or payment of associated receivables or payables. We believe that it is important to consider adjusted cash flow from operations separately, as we believe it can often be a better way to discuss changes in operating trends in our business caused by changes in production, prices, operating costs, and related operational factors, without regard to whether the earned or incurred item was collected or paid during that year. We also use this measure because the collection of our receivables or payment of our obligations has not been a significant issue for our business, but merely a timing issue from one period to the next, with fluctuations generally caused by significant changes in commodity prices or significant changes in drilling activity. The net change in assets and liabilities relating to operations is also important as it does require or provide additional cash for use in our business; however, we prefer to discuss its effect separately. For instance, during 2004, we had a $31.5 million difference between our adjusted cash flow from operations and our GAAP cash flow from operations. The most significant factor was the transfer of approximately $12.5 million of accrued production receivables relating to our offshore properties that existed as of the closing date to the offshore property purchaser. This reduction in accrued production receivables during 2004 was not considered a collection of receivables for our GAAP cash flow from operations. In addition to the effect of transferred receivables, our other accrued production receivables increased during the year due to the increase in commodity prices, and we reduced our accounts payable and accrued liabilities by approximately $10.5 million as a result of less overall activity as of year end. During 2005, we had a $17.6 million increase to our GAAP cash flow from operations resulting from the net change in assets and liabilities relating to operations. This is primarily due to higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities associated with increased capital spending levels as compared to the prior year. Our accrual for production receivables was higher at the end of 2006 than a year earlier, due to higher oil and natural gas prices, partially offsetting the benefit of higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities. During 2006, we also had a $13.4 million increase to our GAAP cash flow from operations resulting from the same items as in 2005; namely higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the higher spending levels, partially offset by an increase in our accrued production receivable as a result of the higher production levels in 2006. 39 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

As outlined in the above table, average production in 2006 increased 23% (6,987 BOE/d) over 2005 levels. The third quarter of 2005 was negatively affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, as approximately 1,100 BOE/d is estimated as having been deferred during that period. If last years average production is adjusted to include this deferred production, the average production increase between the two years would be reduced to approximately 19%. Of this adjusted annual increase, the January 2006 acquisition contributed approximately 2,148 BOE/d of the increase (36%) with 1,122 BOE/d attributable to the Mississippi non CO2 floods and 1,026 BOE/d to Alabama fields, although a small portion of that increase was from our internal development efforts following the acquisition. Production in the Mississippi non CO2 floods area declined only modestly during 2006 (before giving effect to the January 2006 acquisition related increase noted above) and also during 2005. Recent drilling activity in the Heidelberg Selma Chalk (natural gas) has helped offset the gradual declines in oil production during 2006 and 2005. See CO2 Operations above for a discussion of the tertiary related production. Our onshore Louisiana production for 2006 increased 1,773 BOE/d (29% increase) over the prior years level, due primarily to production increases at Thornwell and South Chauvin Fields as a result of 2005 and 2006 drilling activity in that area. We drilled 15 successful wells during 2005, which boosted the production levels in early 2006. However, our Louisiana production is currently declining, as evidenced by the decline between the third and fourth quarters of 2006, as a result of depletion with insufficient new production to offset it as our 2006 success rate was not as good as it had been during 2005. Since our budget for 2007 has been reduced in this area, it is unlikely that our production here will increase during 2007. Our Louisiana properties are generally shorter lived properties than our properties in most other areas, and therefore decline rather rapidly, requiring a consistent increase in new production in order to maintain production levels. Our production in the Barnett Shale area during 2006 increased 2,723 BOE/d (127% increase) over our 2005 level, also as a result of increased drilling activity, with 46 wells drilled during 2006, as compared to 23 wells drilled during 2005. Production from this area has increased every quarter during the last two years, with additional modest increases expected during most of 2007 as we plan to drill 35 to 40 wells in this area during 2007, although this upward trend will not continue indefinitely. These wells are characterized by steep decline rates in their first year of production (as much as 50% to 60%), followed by a gradual leveling off of production and a resultant slow decline rate, giving them an overall long production life. 41 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations As a result of the sale of our offshore properties in July 2004, total production decreased between fiscal year ends 2004 and 2005. If 2004 is adjusted to exclude offshore production, overall production increased approximately 6% on a BOE/d basis during 2005, anchored by the increased production from our tertiary operations and from our Barnett Shale play, generally offset by overall declines in production from our onshore conventional properties in Mississippi and natural gas wells in Louisiana. Our production for 2006 was weighted toward oil (62%) compared to 67% in 2005 and 58% in 2004, and we expect a similar weighting toward oil in 2007 due to our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations, unless we make an acquisition that is predominantly natural gas. Oil and Natural Gas Revenues. Our oil and natural gas revenues have increased for each of the last two years, primarily as a result of higher commodity prices, offset in part in 2005 by lower production as a result of our 2004 sale of offshore properties, but supplemented in 2006 by a 23% increase in production levels. Between fiscal year end 2005 and 2006, revenues increased by 31%. The 23% increase in production in 2006, as compared to production in 2005, increased oil and natural gas revenues by $128.8 million (77% of the total revenue increase) and the 6% higher overall commodity prices in 2006 (on a BOE basis) further increased revenue by $38.7 million (23% of the total revenue increase). Between 2004 and 2005, revenues increased by 23%. The overall increase in commodity prices contributed $148.0 million in additional revenues, (142% of the increase); partially offset by an overall decrease in revenues of $43.7 million (a negative 42% of the total revenue increase) related to the 10% lower production volumes. Our net average realized crude oil price has increased each year, averaging 18% higher in 2006 over 2005 levels and 84% higher in 2005 over 2004 levels. Our net average realized natural gas price decreased 8% in 2006 as compared to 2005 levels, but the average price in 2005 was 38% higher than during 2004. On a weighted average net price per BOE, the increases in oil prices have more than offset the less consistent natural gas prices, resulting in a 6% increase in 2006 price levels as compared to 2005 prices and a 37% increase in 2005 prices as compared to 2004 levels. Our net revenue is also affected by the difference between our net average price and the NYMEX quoted price (i.e., the NYMEX differential). During 2004 and continuing into 2005 and 2006, the discount for our heavier, sour crude (which predominantly applies to our Eastern Mississippi production) increased significantly, lowering our overall net price relative to NYMEX. Our net oil price averaged $4.91 below NYMEX during 2004, increased to $6.33 during 2005, and further increased to $6.41 during 2006. This occurred in spite of our increasing light sweet oil production from our Phase I tertiary operations, which should have improved our overall net price as such crude receives near NYMEX prices and is becoming a higher percentage of our overall production. However, as evident in 2005 and 2006, the oil market is subject to significant and sudden changes and it is difficult to forecast these trends, although our experience indicates that the discount or NYMEX differential for our heavier sour crude increases as NYMEX oil prices increase. Our net natural gas prices relative to NYMEX fluctuate primarily as a result of the trend in the NYMEX prices during the month. Since most of our natural gas is sold on an index price that is set near the first of each month, the variance will decrease if NYMEX natural gas prices consistently decrease during the quarter and the opposite is true if prices are increasing. Our natural gas differentials relative to NYMEX improved in 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily due to decreasing natural gas prices throughout most of the year, but the opposite was true during 2005, when prices were generally rising. During 2006 our natural gas price averaged $0.13 above NYMEX, during 2005 we had an average discount to NYMEX of $0.49, and during 2004 we had an average premium of $0.02 to NYMEX. The NYMEX differential can also vary by area and our natural gas in the Barnett Shale area has a higher discount to NYMEX than the natural gas in Louisiana. Since our production in the Barnett area is growing and expected to increase again during 2007, while our Louisiana natural gas is generally declining, if prices remain consistent, we would expect our discount to NYMEX to gradually increase. Oil and natural gas derivative contracts. During 2006, we made payments on our derivative contracts of $5.3 million, related to oil swaps put in place in late 2005 to protect the rate of return on the fields acquired in January 2006. These payments lowered our effective net oil price received in 2006 by $0.64 per Bbl. During 2005, we made payments on our derivative contracts of $16.8 million, down from $84.6 million paid out during the prior year. Our 2005 payments related to a natural gas collar, lowering our effective net natural gas price by $0.78 per Mcf. During 2004, we paid out $64.1 million on our derivative contracts ($9.10 per Bbl) and $20.4 million ($0.68 42 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations per Mcf) on our natural gas derivative contracts relating to swaps and collars we purchased one to two years earlier when commodity prices were lower. About $30.5 million of the payments related to swaps originally put in place to protect the rate of return for the COHO acquisition in August 2002. Changing commodity prices cause fluctuations in the mark to market value adjustments of our derivative contracts. We recognized a non cash gain of $25.1 million in 2006 as a result of the decreasing prices, primarily related to the 75 MMcf/d of natural gas swaps for calendar 2007 that we entered into during December 2006. During 2005, because of our decision to abandon hedge accounting as of January 1, 2005, we recognized a non cash expense of $12.2 million primarily related to the amortization of the fair value of the derivative contracts in place as of January 1, 2005 over the remaining life of the contracts, which was generally 2005. During 2004, we recognized only $1.3 million of mark to market non cash value adjustments as we were following hedge accounting prior to January 1, 2005. See also Market Risk Management. Operating Expenses. Our lease operating expenses have increased each year on both a per BOE basis and in absolute dollars primarily as a result of (i) our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations (see discussion of those expenses under CO2 Operations above), (ii) general cost inflation in our industry, (iii) increased personnel and related costs, (iv) higher fuel and energy costs to operate our properties, (v) increasing lease payments for certain of our tertiary operating facilities and equipment, and (vi) higher workover costs. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) effective January 1, 2006 (see Overview Operating results) also added approximately $1.5 million of non cash charges to 2006 operating expenses, representing the stock compensation expense pertaining to operating personnel. During 2006, operating costs averaged $12.46 per BOE, up from $9.98 per BOE in 2005 and $7.22 per BOE during 2004. Operating expenses of our tertiary operations increased from $24.6 million in 2004 to $40.4 million during 2005 and $65.0 million during 2006, as a result of increased tertiary activity. Tertiary operating expenses were particularly impacted by higher power and energy costs, higher costs for CO2 and payments on leased facilities and equipment (see CO2 Operations above). We expect this increase in tertiary operating costs to continue and to further increase our cost per BOE as these costs become a more significant portion of our total production and operations. Workover expenses increased by over $11.5 million during 2006 as compared to 2005 levels, with over one half of the increase relating to costs incurred on fields acquired during the year to bring them up to our operating standard. Workover expenses were higher in 2005 than in 2004 primarily due to expenses to repair a mechanical failure on one onshore Louisiana well. Production taxes and marketing expenses generally change in proportion to commodity prices and therefore have been higher in each of the last three years along with the increasing commodity prices. The sale of our offshore properties in 2004 also contributed to the increase in production taxes and marketing expenses on a per BOE basis during 2005 and 2006, as most of our offshore properties were exempt from severance taxes. General and Administrative Expenses During the last three years, general and administrative (GA) expenses have increased on both a gross and per BOE basis as outlined below: Year Ended December 31, Amounts in Thousands Except Per BOE and Employee Data 2006 2005 2004 Gross GA expense $ 94,095 $ 64,622 $ 53,658 State franchise taxes 1,825 1,454 923 Operator labor and overhead recovery charges (45,283 ) (32,452 ) (28,048 ) Capitalized exploration expense (7,623 ) (5,084 ) (5,072 ) Net GA expense $ 43,014 $ 28,540 $ 21,461 Average GA expense per BOE $ 3.20 $ 2.62 $ 1.78 Employees as of December 31 596 460 380 43 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Gross GA expenses increased $29.5 million, or 46%, between 2005 and 2006 and $11.0 million, or 20%, between 2004 and 2005. The single biggest increase during 2006 was due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in January 2006, which increased gross GA expense by approximately $8.9 million during the year, representing the non cash charge for stock compensation (stock options and stock appreciation rights) pertaining to personnel charged to GA. In addition, 2006 expenses include approximately $3.5 million of non cash compensation expense associated with the amortization of deferred compensation resulting from the issuance of restricted stock to officers and directors during 2004 which was already being expensed prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). During 2006, we also incurred a $5.3 million charge to earnings related to the modification of the vesting terms of certain restricted stock and stock options previously granted to our former Senior Vice President of Operations, associated with his departure, and the expensing of approximately $750,000 related to the retirement of our Vice President of Marketing. GA also increased because of higher compensation costs due to additional employees, associated expenses and wage increases. During 2006 we had a net increase of 30% in our employee count related to our acquisitions and increased activity level and a 21% increase during the prior year. In addition, due to increased competitive pressures in the industry, our wages are increasing at a rate higher than general inflation and we expect this trend to continue. As an example, in 2006 we granted a 5% mid year pay raise to all employees in order to remain competitive with industry compensation levels. During 2005, we incurred approximately $1.4 million to provide food, water, gasoline, and other essential supplies to our employees and charitable organizations in Mississippi and Louisiana following the hurricanes. In addition, we have had higher professional service and consultant fees during 2005, primarily related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance, investigation of hotline reports, and documentation and testing of our new software system that we began using in January 2005, as well as increased maintenance costs as a result of the change to our new software system. Many of these expenses were also applicable in 2006. These 2005 increases were offset by the absence of approximately $2.4 million of employee severance payments paid in 2004 related to the sale of our offshore properties in July 2004. Higher operator overhead recovery charges resulting from incremental development activity helped to partially offset the increase in gross GA, partially reduced by the impact of the offshore property sale. Our well operating agreements allow us, when we are the operator, to charge a well with a specified overhead rate during the drilling phase and also to charge a monthly fixed overhead rate for each producing well. As a result of the additional operated wells from acquisitions, additional tertiary operations, drilling activity during the past year, and increased compensation expense (including the allocation of stock compensation to lease operating expense) the amount we recovered as operator labor and overhead charges increased by 40% between 2005 and 2006 and 16% between 2004 and 2005. Capitalized exploration costs increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to increased compensation costs, most of which related to the expensing of stock based compensation associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Capitalized exploration costs were relatively unchanged between 2005 and 2004 as the personnel reductions associated with the sale of our offshore properties in July 2004 offset the other increases. The net effect of the increases in gross GA expenses, operator overhead recoveries and capitalized exploration costs was a 51% increase in net GA expense between 2005 and 2006 and a 33% increase between 2004 and 2005. Interest and Financing Expenses Year Ended December 31, Amounts in Thousands Except Per BOE Data 2006 2005 2004 Cash interest expense $ 33,787 $ 18,800 $ 18,506 Non cash interest expense 1,121 827 962 Less: Capitalized interest (11,333 ) (1,649 ) Interest expense $ 23,575 $ 17,978 $ 19,468 Interest and other income $ 5,603 $ 3,218 $ 2,388 Average net cash interest expense per BOE (1) $ 1.26 $ 1.28 $ 1.34 Average debt outstanding $ 455,603 $ 248,825 $ 270,770 Average interest rate (2) 7.4 % 7.6 % 6.8 % (1) Cash interest expense less capitalized interest and other income on a BOE basis. (2) Includes commitment fees but excludes amortization of debt issue costs. 44 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Interest expense increased in 2006, primarily due to substantially higher average debt levels offset in part by higher interest capitalized on our significant unevaluated properties, primarily related to our 2006 acquisitions. Debt levels were unusually low in the first half of 2005 following the sale of our offshore properties in mid 2004. Conversely, debt levels increased in the first quarter of 2006 following the $250 million acquisition which closed at the end of January 2006, funded by $150 million of subordinated debt issued in December 2005 and $100 million of bank debt borrowed at closing. The bank debt was repaid in April 2006 with the proceeds from an equity sale made that month (see Overview April 2006 Equity Offering), but an additional $50 million was subsequently borrowed to fund the Delhi acquisition in May 2006 (see Overview Recent Acquisitions) and an additional $84 million for general working capital and the payment of the option on Hastings Field entered into in November 2006, leaving us with total bank debt of $134 million as of December 31, 2006. Interest expense for 2005 decreased from 2004 levels primarily due to capitalized interest of $1.6 million relating to the construction of our CO2 pipeline to East Mississippi and the payoff of our bank debt in the third quarter of 2004 with the proceeds from our offshore property sale. As a result of lower production because of our 2004 offshore sale and production deferred as a result of the two hurricanes, interest expense on a per BOE basis was not as positive as it was on an absolute basis. Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization (DDA) Year Ended December 31, Amounts in Thousands, Except Per BOE Data 2006 2005 2004 Depletion and depreciation of oil and natural gas properties $ 132,880 $ 88,949 $ 88,505 Depletion and depreciation of CO2 assets 8,375 5,334 4,664 Asset retirement obligations 2,389 1,682 2,408 Depreciation of other fixed assets 5,521 2,837 1,950 Total DDA $ 149,165 $ 98,802 $ 97,527 DDA per BOE: Oil and natural gas properties $ 10.08 $ 8.34 $ 7.54 CO2 assets and other fixed assets 1.03 0.75 0.55 Total DDA cost per BOE $ 11.11 $ 9.09 $ 8.09 Our proved reserves increased from 129.4 MMBOE as of December 31, 2004, to 152.6 MMBOE as of December 31, 2005, and further increased to 174.3 MMBOE as of December 31, 2006. Reserve quantities and associated production are only one side of the DDA equation, with capital expenditures less accumulated depletion, asset retirement obligations less related salvage value, and projected future development costs making up the remainder of the calculation. We adjust our DDA rate each quarter for significant changes in our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and costs, and thus our DDA rate could change significantly in the future. Our DDA rate increased 22% between fiscal year end 2005 and 2006, largely because we did not add many tertiary oil reserves during 2006, which historically have had a lower finding and development cost than our overall company average. We added approximately 17.8 MMBOE of reserves in the Barnett Shale during 2006 and approximately 6.0 MMBOE in our tertiary oil properties and only minor amounts elsewhere. Further, costs continued to climb in the industry throughout 2006, causing us not only to exceed our cost estimates on our 2006 projects, but also to re evaluate and raise our future development costs on our proved undeveloped reserves. Lastly, we did not have any significant discoveries in our exploration program in Louisiana, which further contributed to an increase in our DDA rate. In general, 2006 was a transition year for us with regard to our tertiary oil reserves. Prior to 2006, many of our tertiary floods could be considered proven near the start of a project as they were analogous to Little Creek Field (an already producing substantial tertiary flood) and thus it was not necessary to have a production response to CO2 injections before we recognized proved reserves. Conversely, most of our new floods, including two that we started during 2006 (Soso and Martinville Fields), are not analogous and thus must have an oil production response to the CO2 injections before we can recognize tertiary proved oil reserves in these fields, even though we believe there is a similar risk profile in flooding these fields. Due to several delays throughout the year, the Soso and Martinville floods were completed so late in 2006 that there was not a significant production response before year end, a pre condition to booking proved reserves in these fields. 45 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We allocated approximately $124 million of our $250 million January 2006 acquisition costs and virtually all of the second quarter 2006 $50 million Delhi acquisition costs to unevaluated properties to reflect the significant potential reserves that we considered to be part of these acquisitions. As a result, these acquisitions did not materially affect our overall DDA rate, as the amount included in our full cost pool was a cost per BOE relatively consistent with our overall DDA rate. Our DDA rate on a per BOE basis increased 12% between 2004 and 2005, primarily due to rising costs and increases in capital spending. During 2005, we spent approximately $71.0 million on acquisitions, of which approximately $50.1 million was included in our full cost pool, with the balance becoming part of our unevaluated properties. Due to high commodity prices, our acquisition costs per BOE was around $14.60 per BOE, contributing to the higher DDA rate. In addition, most of our future development cost estimates on our proved undeveloped reserves have been increased to reflect the rising costs in the industry. Our DDA rate for our CO2 and other fixed assets has increased in both 2005 and 2006 as a result of the Free State CO2 pipeline to eastern Mississippi, which went into service late in the first quarter of 2006, additional costs incurred drilling CO2 wells during each year and higher associated future development costs, partially offset by an increase in CO2 reserves from 2.7 Tcf as of December 31, 2004, to 4.6 Tcf as of December 31, 2005, to 5.5 Tcf as of December 31, 2006 (100% working interest basis before amounts attributable to Genesis volumetric production payments see CO2 Operations CO2 Resources). As part of the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred, discounted to its present value using our credit adjusted risk free interest rate, with a corresponding capitalized amount. The liability is accreted each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. On an undiscounted basis, we estimated our retirement obligations as of December 31, 2004, to be $52.1 million ($21.5 million present value), with an estimated salvage value of $43.6 million, on an undiscounted basis. As of December 31, 2005, we estimated our retirement obligations to be $69.1 million ($27.1 million present value), with an estimated salvage value of $50.2 million. As of December 31, 2006, we estimated our retirement obligations to be $91.3 million ($41.1 million present value), with an estimated salvage value of $60.0 million, the increase related to our increased activity and higher cost estimates due to the inflation in our industry. DDA is calculated on the increase to oil and natural gas and CO2 properties, net of estimated salvage value. We also include the accretion of discount on the asset retirement obligation in our DDA expense. Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation. We did not have any full cost pool ceiling test write downs in 2004, 2005 or 2006. Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, Amounts in Thousands, Except Per BOE Amounts 2006 2005 2004 Current income tax expense $ 19,865 $ 27,177 $ 22,929 Deferred income tax provision 107,252 54,393 16,463 Total income tax provision $ 127,117 $ 81,570 $ 39,392 Average income tax provision per BOE $ 9.47 $ 7.50 $ 3.27 Net effective tax rate 38.6 % 32.9 % 32.3 % Total net deferred tax asset (liability) $ (229,925 ) $ (129,474 ) $ (71,936 ) Our income tax provision for all three periods was based on an estimated statutory tax rate of approximately 39%. For 2004 and 2005, our net effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the recognition of enhanced oil recovery credits (EOR) which lowered our overall tax expense. For 2006, we did not earn any additional EOR credits because of the high oil prices during 2005, which completely phased out our ability to earn any additional credits. Under the recently adopted accounting rules of SFAS No. 123(R), a tax benefit, if any, for compensation expenses arising from the issuance of incentive stock options (the majority of our options issued prior to 2006) is not recognizable during the vesting period, the period during which they are expensed for book purposes, which also caused a slight increase in our effective tax rate in 2006. During the third quarter of 2004, we recognized 46 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations approximately $21.0 million of current income taxes as a result of the sale of our offshore properties, which was a gain for income tax purposes. The taxes on the offshore sale were primarily alternative minimum taxes as we were able to offset the related regular tax with our net operating loss carryforwards that existed at that time. We no longer have any net operating loss carryforwards. In all three periods, the current income tax expense represents our anticipated alternative minimum cash taxes that we cannot offset with EOR credits. As of December 31, 2006, we had an estimated $41.9 million of EOR credit carryforwards that we can utilize to reduce a portion of our cash taxes. These EOR credits do not begin to expire until 2020. Since the ability to earn additional enhanced oil recovery credits is reduced or even eliminated based on the level of oil prices, we do not expect to earn any EOR credits during 2007 because of the high oil prices during 2006. If oil prices remain at current levels or increase further in the future, we will not earn any additional EOR credits and once our existing EOR credits are utilized, our cash taxes will also increase. Results of Operations on a per BOE Basis The following table summarizes the cash flow, DDA and results of operations on a per BOE basis for the comparative periods. Each of the individual components is discussed above. Year Ended December 31, Per BOE Data 2006 2005 2004 Oil and natural gas revenues $ 53.37 $ 50.49 $ 36.88 Loss on settlements of derivative contracts (0.39 ) (1.54 ) (7.01 ) Lease operating expenses (12.46 ) (9.98 ) (7.22 ) Production taxes and marketing expenses (2.71 ) (2.54 ) (1.55 ) Production netback 37.81 36.43 21.10 Non tertiary CO2 operating margin 0.46 0.54 0.41 General and administrative expenses (3.20 ) (2.62 ) (1.78 ) Net cash interest expense (1.26 ) (1.28 ) (1.34 ) Current income taxes and other (0.41 ) (1.50 ) (1.78 ) Changes in assets and liabilities relating to operations 1.00 1.62 (2.63 ) Cash flow from operations 34.40 33.19 13.98 DDA (11.11 ) (9.09 ) (8.09 ) Deferred income taxes (7.99 ) (5.00 ) (1.37 ) Non cash derivative adjustments 1.87 (1.12 ) (0.11 ) Changes in assets and liabilities and other non cash items (2.09 ) (2.67 ) 2.43 Net income $ 15.08 $ 15.31 $ 6.84 Market Risk Management We finance some of our acquisitions and other expenditures with fixed and variable rate debt. These debt agreements expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates. The following table presents the carrying and fair values of our debt, along with average interest rates. We had $134 million of bank debt outstanding as of December 31, 2006, and $150 million outstanding at February 28, 2007. The fair value of the subordinated debt is based on quoted market prices. None of our debt has any triggers or covenants regarding our debt ratings with rating agencies. Maturity Dates Carrying Fair Amounts in Thousands 2006 2011 Value Value Fixed rate debt: Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013, net of discount $ $ 223,786 $ 227,250 (The interest rate on the subordinated debt is a fixed rate of 7.5%.) Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 $ $ 150,000 $ 152,250 (The interest rate on the subordinated debt is a fixed rate of 7.5%.) 47 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. These contracts have consisted of price floors, collars and fixed price swaps. Historically, we hedged up to 75% of our anticipated production each year to provide us with a reasonably certain amount of cash flow to cover most of our budgeted exploration and development expenditures without incurring significant debt. Since 2005 and beyond, we have entered into fewer derivative contracts, primarily because of our strong financial position resulting from our lower levels of debt relative to our cash flow from operations. We did make an exception in late 2006 when we swapped 80% to 90% of our forecasted 2007 natural gas production at a weighted average price of $7.96 per Mcf. We did this to protect our 2007 projected cash flow primarily because we currently plan to spend $200 million to $250 million more than we expect to generate in cash flow from operations (see Capital Resources and Liquidity) and we did not want to be exposed to the risk of lower natural gas prices. These natural gas swaps had increased in value significantly during the short time we held them in 2006 (see value discussion below), although by February 23, 2007, this positive market value was virtually gone as natural gas prices rebounded during the first part of 2007. When we make a significant acquisition, we generally attempt to hedge a large percentage, up to 100%, of the forecasted proved production for the subsequent one to three years following the acquisition in order to help provide us with a minimum return on our investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had derivative contracts in place related to our $250 million acquisition that closed on January 31, 2006, on which we entered into contracts to cover 100% of the estimated proved producing production at the time we signed the purchase and sale agreement. While these derivative contracts related to the acquisition represent approximately 7% of our estimated 2007 production, they are intended to help protect our acquisition economics related to the first three years of production from the proved producing reserves that we acquired. These swaps cover 2,000 Bbls/d for 2007 at a price of $58.93 per Bbl; and 2,000 Bbls/d for 2008 at a price of $57.34 per Bbl. All of the mark to market valuations used for our financial derivatives are provided by external sources and are based on prices that are actively quoted. We manage and control market and counterparty credit risk through established internal control procedures that are reviewed on an ongoing basis. We attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies, monitoring procedures, and diversification. For a full description of our derivative contract positions at year end 2006, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2005, for accounting purposes, we elected to de designate our existing derivative contracts as hedges and began to account for them as speculative contracts. This means that any changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion to earnings. During 2005, we amortized the December 31, 2004 balance in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss to earnings as that was the remaining life of those contracts. Information regarding our current derivative contract positions and results of our historical derivative activity is included in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2006, our derivative contracts were recorded at their fair value, which was a net asset of approximately $15.7 million, an increase of $25.1 million from the $9.4 million fair value liability recorded as of December 31, 2005. This change is the result of lower commodity prices, primarily relating to our natural gas hedges for 2007 (see above). During 2006, we recognized total income related to our hedge contracts of $19.8 million, consisting of $5.3 million of cash payments on settlements of expired contracts and $25.1 million of income relating to market to market non cash adjustments. Based on NYMEX crude oil futures prices at December 31, 2006, we would expect to make future cash payments of $11.7 million on our crude oil commodity derivative contracts. If crude oil futures prices were to decline by 10%, we would expect to make future cash payments on our crude oil commodity derivative contracts of $2.1 million, and if futures prices were to increase by 10% we would expect to pay $21.4 million. Based on NYMEX natural gas futures prices at December 31, 2006, we would expect to receive future cash payments of $26.5 million on our natural gas commodity hedges. If natural gas futures prices were to decline by 10%, the amount we would expect to receive under our natural gas commodity hedges would increase to $45.6 million, and if future prices were to increase by 10% we would expect to receive $7.3 million. 48 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we select certain accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments regarding the application of those policies. Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements. Full Cost Method of Accounting, Depletion and Depreciation and Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Businesses involved in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. We apply the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Another acceptable method of accounting for oil and gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting. In general, the primary differences between the two methods are related to the capitalization of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment. Under the full cost method, all geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool, whereas under the successful efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred. In the assessment of impairment of oil and gas properties, the successful efforts method follows the guidance of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, under which the net book value of assets are measured for impairment against the undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method, the full cost pool (net book value of oil and gas properties) is measured against future cash flows discounted at 10% using commodity prices in effect at the end of the reporting period. The financial results for a given period could be substantially different depending on the method of accounting that an oil and gas entity applies. In our application of full cost accounting for our oil and gas producing activities, we make significant estimates at the end of each period related to accruals for oil and gas revenues, production, capitalized costs and operating expenses. We calculate these estimates with our best available data, which includes, among other things, production reports, price posting, information compiled from daily drilling reports and other internal tracking devices and analysis of historical results and trends. While management is not aware of any required revisions to its estimates, there will likely be future adjustments resulting from such things as changes in ownership interests, payouts, joint venture audits, re allocations by the purchaser/pipeline, or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and natural gas industry, many of which will require retroactive application. These types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated or determined and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs. Under full cost accounting, the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom used to perform the full cost ceiling test have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible, including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare the report, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statement disclosures. Over the last four years, Denburys annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately 2% of the previous years estimates and have been both positive and negative. Changes in commodity prices also affect our reserve quantities. During 2004, 2005 and 2006, the change to reserve quantities related to commodity prices was relatively small, less than in prior years, as prices were relatively high each year end. These changes in quantities affect our DDA rate and the combined effect of changes in quantities and commodity prices impacts our full cost ceiling test calculation. For example, we estimate that a 5% increase in our estimate of proved reserves quantities would have lowered our fourth quarter 2006 DDA rate from $11.60 per Bbl to approximately $11.12 per Bbl and a 5% decrease in our proved reserve quantities would have increased our DDA rate to approximately $12.13 per Bbl. Also, reserve quantities and their ultimate values are the primary factors in determining the borrowing base under our bank credit facility and are determined solely by our banks. 49 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations There can also be significant questions as to whether reserves are sufficiently supported by technical evidence to be considered proven. In some cases our proven reserves are less than what we believe to exist because additional evidence, including production testing, is required in order to classify the reserves as proven. In other cases, properties such as certain of our potential tertiary recovery projects may not have proven reserves assigned to them primarily because we have not yet completed a specific plan for development or firmly scheduled such development. We have a corporate policy whereby we generally do not book proved undeveloped reserves unless the project has been committed to internally, which normally means it is scheduled within the next one to two years (or at least the commencement of the project is scheduled in the case of longer term multi year projects such as waterfloods and tertiary recovery projects). Therefore, particularly with regard to potential reserves from tertiary recovery (our CO2 operations), there is uncertainty as to whether the reserves should be included as proven or not. We also have a corporate policy whereby proved undeveloped reserves must be economic at long term historical prices, which are usually significantly less than the year end prices used in our reserve report. This also can have the effect of eliminating certain projects being included in our estimates of proved reserves, which projects would otherwise be included if undeveloped reserves were determined to be economic solely based on current prices in a high price environment, as was the case during the last three year ends. (See Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization under Results of Operations above for a further discussion.) All of these factors and the decisions made regarding these issues can have a significant effect on our proven reserves and thus on our DDA rate, full cost ceiling test calculation, borrowing base and financial statements. See also discussion of requirements to book proven tertiary oil reserves at Results of Operations Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization. Asset Retirement Obligations We have significant obligations related to the plugging and abandonment of our oil and gas wells, the removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and returning such land to its original condition. SFAS No. 143 requires that we estimate the future cost of this obligation, discount it to its present value, and record a corresponding asset and liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates, including the ultimate expected cost of the obligation, the expected future date of the required cash payment, and interest and inflation rates. Revisions to these estimates may be required based on changes to cost estimates, the timing of settlement, and changes in legal requirements. Any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis and an adjustment in our DDA expense in future periods. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our asset retirement obligations. Accounting for Tertiary Injection Costs We expense at the time of injection our costs associated with the CO2 we use in our tertiary recovery operations. Our costs associated with the CO2 we produce and inject are principally our costs to produce, transport and pay royalties. There are other acceptable alternatives in accounting for tertiary injectant costs, such as capitalizing these costs as oil and gas properties and depleting them over time, or expensing a portion and deferring a portion of the cost if the injectant material can be recovered and sold at a later time. Our decision to expense our tertiary injectant costs at the time of injection results in greater expense to us at the onset of a new tertiary recovery project as we may inject CO2 for several months before we experience any production response. Also, the injection of CO2 will generally be higher in the earlier portions of the life of the project and will gradually decrease over time. We expensed costs for the CO2 we injected of $18.1 million in 2006, $10.1 million in 2005, and $4.6 million in 2004. Income Taxes We make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. Our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes, tax credits, and prior to year end 2005, net operating loss carry forwards. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns. Further, we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets (primarily our 50 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations enhanced oil recovery credits). If recovery is not likely, we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover, which would result in an increase to our income tax expense. As of December 31, 2006 we believe that all of our deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet will ultimately be recovered. If our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not probable. A 1% increase in our effective tax rate would have increased our calculated income tax expense by approximately $3.3 million, $2.5 million, and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning our income taxes. Oil and Gas Derivative Contracts We enter into derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with future oil and natural gas production. These contracts have historically consisted of options, in the form of price floors or collars, and fixed price swaps. Under SFAS No. 133, every derivative instrument is required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value. If the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings. If the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (equity) to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective. Prior to 2005, we applied hedge accounting to our commodity derivative contracts, thereby recording a significant portion of the fair value changes to equity instead of income. We recognized losses on ineffectiveness on our hedges of $2.7 million for 2004. We measured and computed hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis. If a hedging instrument became ineffective, hedge accounting was discontinued and any deferred gains or losses on the cash flow hedge remained in accumulated other comprehensive income until the periods during which the hedges would have otherwise expired. If we determined it probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument were recognized in earnings immediately. As of January 1, 2005, we abandoned hedge accounting. This means that any changes in the future fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the balance to earnings. While we may experience more volatility in our net income than if we had continued to apply hedge accounting treatment as permitted by SFAS No. 133, we believe that for us the benefits associated with applying hedge accounting do not outweigh the cost, time and effort to comply with hedge accounting. During 2006 and 2005, we recognized expense (income) of ($25.1) million and $4.5 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair market value of our derivative contracts. For 2004, if we had not chosen to designate hedge accounting treatment to our oil and natural gas derivative contracts, or if none of our derivative contracts had qualified for hedge accounting treatment, we estimate that our net income would have increased by approximately $25.0 million. Stock Compensation Plans Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment using the modified prospective application method described in the statement. Among other items, SFAS 123(R) eliminates the use of APB 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the financial statements. Under the modified prospective application method, effective January 1, 2006, we began to recognize compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of December 31, 2005, over the remaining service periods, and for new awards granted or modified after January 1, 2006. We estimate the fair value of stock option or stock appreciation right (SAR) awards on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option valuation model requires the input of somewhat subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and expected term. Other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the Black Scholes model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of the Companys stock. The risk free interest rates used are the U.S. Treasury yield for bonds 51 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant. Our dividend yield is zero, as Denbury does not pay a dividend. We utilize historical experience in arriving at our assumptions for volatility and expected term inputs. We recognize the stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. The expense we recognize is net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate our forfeiture rate based on prior experience and true it up for actual results as the awards vest. As of December 31, 2006, there was $11.9 million of total compensation cost to be recognized in future periods related to non vested stock options and SARs. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.2 years. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires us to make other estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reliable and believe that the ultimate actual results will not differ significantly from those reported; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and such risks and uncertainties could cause the actual results to differ materially from our estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 requires recognition of the impact of a tax position in the Companys financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective as of the beginning of the Companys 2007 fiscal year, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. We are still evaluating the potential impact of this interpretation on the Companys financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, with earlier application encouraged. Any amounts recognized upon adoption as a cumulative effect adjustment will be recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. We have not yet determined the impact of this Statement on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Forward Looking Information The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements found in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are forward looking statements, as that term is defined in Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be or may concern, among other things, forecasted capital expenditures, drilling activity or methods, acquisition plans and proposals and dispositions, development activities, cost savings, production rates and volumes or forecasts thereof, hydrocarbon reserves, hydrocarbon or expected reserve quantities and values, potential reserves from tertiary operations, hydrocarbon prices, pricing assumptions based on current and projected oil and gas prices, liquidity, regulatory matters, mark to market values, competition, long term forecasts of production, finding cost, rates of return, estimated costs or changes in costs, future capital expenditures and overall economics and other variables surrounding our tertiary operations and future plans. Such forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as plan, estimate, expect, predict, anticipate, projected, should, assume, believe, target or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Such forward looking information is based upon managements current plans, expectations, estimates and assumptions and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect current plans, anticipated actions, 52 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
