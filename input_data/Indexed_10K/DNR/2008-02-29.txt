Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We are a growing independent oil and gas company engaged in acquisition, development and exploration activities in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. We are the largest oil and natural gas producer in Mississippi; own the largest carbon dioxide (CO2) reserves east of the Mississippi River used for tertiary oil recovery, and hold significant operating acreage in the Barnett Shale play near Fort Worth, Texas, onshore Louisiana and Alabama, and properties in Southeast Texas. Our goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling, and proven engineering extraction processes, including secondary and tertiary recovery operations. Our corporate headquarters are in Plano, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), and we have four primary field offices located in Laurel, Mississippi; McComb, Mississippi; Brandon, Mississippi; and Cleburne, Texas. 2007 Overview Operating Results. During 2007, we set a corporate record for annual cash flow from operations of $570.2 million, a 23% increase over the $461.8 million of cash flow from operations generated during 2006. Our 2007 net income of $253.1 million was 25% higher than our $202.5 million of net income during 2006, even after including a $64.2 million decrease in pre tax income between the respective periods from non cash fair value adjustments associated with our commodity derivative contracts. Record high production levels, higher oil prices, and $25.8 million of incremental net cash receipts on our derivative contracts contributed to the positive results, partially offset by higher overall expenses, lower natural gas prices, and the effect of the $64.2 million differential in non cash fair value adjustments associated with our commodity derivative contracts (see Results of Operations Oil and Natural Gas Revenues). Our fourth quarter 2007 average production rate of 50,371 BOE/d and our 2007 average production of 44,115 BOE/d were Company quarterly and annual production records, with significant increases in our tertiary oil and Barnett Shale production, partially offset by production declines in our Louisiana onshore properties. Higher oil prices further improved 2007 results, as our average realized per BOE commodity price was 11% higher than during 2006, resulting in 13% higher revenues in 2007, together with 20% higher revenues due to higher production levels. Excluding any impact of our commodity derivative income and expense items, our aggregate expenses increased 33% during 2007 as compared to expenses during 2006 due to (i) higher overall industry costs, (ii) a higher percentage of operations related to tertiary operations, which generally have higher operating costs per BOE (see Results of Operations CO2 Operations for a more thorough discussion), (iii) higher average debt levels to finance our $42 million acquisition on March 31, 2007 (see 2007 Acquisitions below) and continued spending in excess of cash flow from operations (see Capital Resources and Liquidity), and (iv) higher compensation expense resulting from additional employees and increased salaries which we consider necessary in order to remain competitive in the industry, partially offset by approximately $6.0 million of non recurring charges to earnings in 2006 related to the departure and retirement of two vice presidents. As has been our practice for several years, we are reinvesting virtually all of our cash flow in new projects, with a desire to further increase our production and reserves. During 2007, our proved reserves increased from 174.3 MMBOE as of December 31, 2006, to 194.7 MMBOE as of December 31, 2007, replacing approximately 250% of our 2007 production, almost entirely from organic growth. The most significant reserve additions during 2007 were in the Barnett Shale (22.8 MMBOE) and in our tertiary operations (12.7 MMBOE). While we booked more proved tertiary reserves in 2007 than in 2006 (6.0 MMBOE), these reserve quantity additions were less than we expect to recognize during the next few years, presuming we have a production response from the tertiary floods we started in 2007 and expect to start in 2008 and 2009 (see Results of Operations Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization for a review of our reserve changes during 2007 and a discussion of our proved tertiary reserves). While overall costs were higher in the 2007 periods than in the comparable 2006 periods, during 2007 the rate of inflation in our industry appears to have moderated, and in some cases, we are beginning to see modest cost reductions. Likewise, although oilfield goods and services are still in tight supply, there have been signs of improvement in overall availability; but some supply issues persist, including long lead times for certain goods and services, such as compressors used in our tertiary recycling facilities and construction services for pipelines. It is difficult to forecast price trends and supply and service availability, which if adverse, can significantly impact both operating costs and capital expenditures, as well as cause delays in achieving our anticipated production targets. 30 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Tertiary Operations. Having enough CO2 to flood our tertiary oil fields is one of the most important ingredients, if not the key ingredient, to our tertiary operations. During 2007, we replaced 164% of our CO2 production, increasing our proved CO2 reserves slightly, from approximately 5.5 Tcf as of December 31, 2006 to approximately 5.6 Tcf as of December 31, 2007 (quantities are on a 100% working interest basis see CO2 Operations CO2 Resources for further information). Oil production from our tertiary operations increased to an average of 14,767 BOE/d in 2007, a 47% increase over 2006 tertiary production level of 10,070 BOE/d, with fourth quarter 2007 tertiary production averaging 17,428 BOE/d. Production from our Phase II operations in Eastern Mississippi (Soso, Eucutta and Martinville Fields) contributed 2,888 BOE/d (approximately 61%) to the increase over the prior years tertiary production level, with the balance of the increase coming from our Phase I fields, except for Little Creek Field which is on a gradual decline. In addition to further development of oil fields we already own and which are slated for tertiary flooding, we are continuing to buy additional oil fields that are candidates for future tertiary flood activity (see 2007 Acquisitions below). Please refer to the section entitled CO2 Operations below for a discussion of these operations, their potential, and the ramifications of our continuing emphasis on these operations. Sale of Louisiana Natural Gas Assets. In October 2007, we entered into an agreement to sell our Louisiana natural gas assets to a privately held company for approximately $180 million (before closing adjustments) plus any amounts received in the future from a net profits interest in a well. In late December 2007, we closed on approximately 70% of that sale with net proceeds of approximately $108.6 million (including estimated final purchase price adjustments), and closed on the remaining 30% on February 20, 2008, with net proceeds at the second closing of approximately $48.9 million. The operating net revenue, net of capital expenditures, between the August 1, 2007, effective date and the respective closing dates was an adjustment to the purchase price, along with other minor closing adjustments. The potential net profits interest relates to a well in the South Chauvin Field and is only earned if operating income from that well exceeds certain levels, which we believe could potentially increase the ultimate sales price by up to 10%. Production attributable to the sold properties averaged approximately 30.6 MMcfe/d (82% natural gas) during the fourth quarter of 2007, representing approximately 10% of our total fourth quarter production and approximately 4% of our total proved reserve quantities as of December 31, 2006. Genesis Transactions. On July 25, 2007, Genesis Energy, L.P. (Genesis), a master limited partnership of which Denbury is the general partner, closed on a previously announced acquisition in which they acquired several energy related businesses from the Davison family of Ruston, Louisiana, for total consideration of approximately $623 million (net of cash acquired at closing and subject to final purchase price adjustments). The acquisition agreement provided that Genesis deliver $560 million of consideration, half in common units at an agreed value of $20.8036 per unit (as compared to a value of $24.52 per unit for accounting purposes) and half in cash, subject to specified purchase price adjustments. In conjunction with that acquisition, we exercised our right to maintain our pro rata (7.4%) ownership of common units, acquiring 1,074,882 additional common units for approximately $22.4 million, in addition to our capital contribution of an additional $6.2 million as general partner to maintain our 2% general partners interest. In order to maintain our pro rata (7.4%) common unit ownership interest in Genesis, we acquired an additional 734,732 common units in a December 2007 Genesis public offering at $21.29 per unit, the public offering price of $22.00 per unit, less the underwriting discount. Our total cost for the units, including the 2% general partner portion of the offering, was $20.0 million. The Company has reached substantial agreement and is in the process of finalizing the business issues with Genesis and its lenders as to the terms of the transactions with Genesis involving the Companys NEJD and Free State CO2 Pipelines, including a long term transportation service arrangement for the Free State line and a 20 year financing lease for the NEJD system. In these transactions, Denbury expects to receive from Genesis $225 million in cash and $25 million of Genesis common limited partnership units at the average closing price of the units on the thirty days prior to closing. The Company anticipates capitalizing these transactions for accounting purposes and currently projects that it will initially pay Genesis approximately $30 million per annum under the financing lease and transportation services agreement (and a lesser pro rated amount for 2008), with future payments for the NEJD pipeline payments fixed at $20.7 million per year during the term of the financing lease, and the payments relating to 31 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations the Free State Pipeline dependant on the volumes of CO2 transported therein. While the business terms of the transactions have been substantially completed, closing remains subject to finalization of legal issues and completion and delivery of closing documentation. Currently, we will also consider similar transactions with Genesis for the new CO2 pipeline we have constructed from Jackson Dome to Tinsley Field and are constructing from Tinsley Field to Delhi Field (the Delta Pipeline), once that pipeline is completed, forecasted at this time to be completed in late 2008 or early 2009, or potentially we could divide that pipeline into two segments and two separate transactions. If in future periods Genesis is able to complete additional acquisitions of non Denbury related assets of sufficient size and with acceptable returns, we would consider additional dropdowns with Genesis of certain of our existing or planned assets provided that such transactions can generate qualified income for a master limited partnership, which may depend in part on the degree to which we ship man made CO2 on such lines and the status of man made CO2 as qualified income. 2007 Acquisitions. On March 30, 2007, we completed an acquisition of six producing oil and natural gas fields, two of which are future potential CO2 tertiary oil flood candidates, collectively called the Seabreeze Complex, located near Houston, Texas, at a cost of approximately $39.4 million. Tertiary operations are not expected to commence at these fields until 2010 or 2011, following anticipated completion of the 300 mile CO2 pipeline from Louisiana to Hastings Field (also near Houston). The acquisition was funded with bank financing under our existing credit facility. At the time of acquisition, these fields had estimated proved conventional reserves of approximately 525 MBOE and produced an average of 759 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2007. We operate all of these fields and own the majority of the working interests. We also purchased East and South Gillock Fields in 2007, small future CO2 tertiary oil flood candidates, also located near Houston, Texas, at a cost of approximately $3.5 million. The conventional reserves and production associated with these fields was negligible at the time of the acquisition. April 2007 Debt Issuance. On April 3, 2007, we issued $150 million of 7.5% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 as an additional issuance under our existing indenture governing our December 2005 sale of $150 million of 7.5% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015. The notes were issued at 100.5% of par, which equates to an effective yield to maturity of 7.4%. The net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $149.2 million, which we used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility. Capital Resources and Liquidity Our current 2008 capital exploration and development budget is approximately $900 million, excluding any potential acquisitions. The current 2008 program includes an estimated $245 million to acquire pipe and right of ways for our proposed CO2 pipeline from Louisiana to Texas (the Green Pipeline) and another $80 million for the segment of the Delta CO2 Pipeline from Tinsley to Delhi Fields. We expect to spend an additional $450 million constructing the Green Pipeline during 2009, making our current anticipated total cost for that line approximately $700 million. Currently, over 50% of the remaining portion of our 2008 budget is expected to be spent on other tertiary related operations, over 25% in the Barnett Shale area, and the balance in other areas. Based on oil and natural gas commodity futures prices as of late February 2008 and our current 2008 production forecasts, our 2008 capital budget is forecasted to be $125 million to $175 million greater than our anticipated cash flow from operations. We plan to fund most of this deficit with cash generated by the anticipated drop down transaction with Genesis (see 2007 Overview Genesis Transactions) and our recently completed sale of Louisiana natural gas assets (see 2007 Overview Sale of Louisiana Natural Gas Assets). We could potentially also generate additional funds of up to $150 million through transactions with Genesis whereby we could drop down our Delta CO2 Pipeline, or portions thereof, to Genesis (see 2007 Overview Genesis Transactions). If the Delta Pipeline drop down to Genesis is not consummated, or if there is still a shortfall in excess of the cash generated by our recently completed Louisiana property sale and proposed drop down of pipelines to Genesis described above, we would likely fund the deficit with bank debt. In addition, if commodity prices were to significantly decrease from current levels, we could also reduce our capital spending during 2008 commensurately, in addition to using bank debt to fund the deficit. As of February 28, 2008, we had $111 million of bank debt outstanding on a $500 million borrowing base, leaving us significant incremental borrowing capacity, more than we currently plan or desire to use. Further, we believe that we could significantly increase our bank borrowing base if desired, and anticipate increasing it at our April 1, 2008 redetermination. 32 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis, adjusting them up or down depending on commodity prices and the resultant cash flow. Therefore, during the last few years as commodity prices have increased, we have increased our capital budget throughout the year. As a result of cost inflation in our industry in recent years, many of our recent year budget increases have related to escalating costs rather than additional projects. Even though there are signs that the rate of this inflationary trend is subsiding, if costs do rise or we spend more than our estimated amounts, we will either have to increase our capital budget or consider deferring a portion of our planned projects. We continue to pursue additional acquisitions of mature oil fields that we believe have potential as future tertiary flood candidates. These possible acquisitions are difficult to forecast and the purchase price can vary widely depending on the levels of existing production, conventional proved reserves and commodity prices. Any additional acquisitions would be funded, at least temporarily, with bank or other debt, although if significant, the acquisition would likely be ultimately funded with more permanent capital such as subordinated debt and or additional equity. Amendment to our bank credit facility. On March 31, 2007, we amended our Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with our nine banks, led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The amendment (i) increased the commitment amount that the banks are committed to fund from $250 million to $350 million, (ii) reconfirmed the borrowing base of $500 million, (iii) authorized last springs $150 million subordinated debt offering (see 2007 Overview April 2007 Debt Issuance), and (iv) authorized us to enter into a sale leaseback type transaction for our CO2 pipelines, not to exceed $300 million, with Genesis, in the type of transaction contemplated and discussed above (see 2007 Overview Genesis Transactions). With regard to our bank credit facility, the borrowing base represents the amount that can be borrowed from a credit standpoint based on our assets, as confirmed by the banks, while the commitment amount is the amount the banks have committed to fund pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement. The banks have the option to participate in any borrowing request by us in excess of the commitment amount ($350 million), up to the borrowing base limit ($500 million), although the banks are not obligated to fund any amount in excess of the commitment amount. At February 28, 2008, we had outstanding $525 million (principal amount) of 7.5% subordinated notes and $111 million of bank debt.

Our 2006 expenditures were funded with $461.8 million of cash flow from operations, $139.8 million of equity issued and $134.0 million of net bank borrowings, and a $13.2 million increase in our accrued capital expenditures, with the balance funded with working capital, predominately cash from the December 2005 issuance of $150 million of subordinated debt. 33 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Commitments and Obligations At December 31, 2007, we have no off balance sheet arrangements, special purpose entities, financing partnerships or guarantees, other than as disclosed in this section. We have no debt or equity triggers based upon our stock or commodity prices. Our dollar denominated payment obligations that are not on our balance sheet include our operating leases, which at year end 2007 totaled $143.8 million (including $98.5 million of equipment costs) relating primarily to the lease financing of certain equipment for CO2 recycling facilities at our tertiary oil fields. We also have several leases relating to office space and other minor equipment leases. Additionally, we have dollar related obligations that are not currently recorded on our balance sheet relating to various obligations for development and exploratory expenditures that arise from our normal capital expenditure program or from other transactions common to our industry. In addition, in order to recover our undeveloped proved reserves, we must also fund the associated future development costs forecasted in our proved reserve reports. For a further discussion of our future development costs and proved reserves, see Results of Operations Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization below. At December 31, 2007, we had a total of $10.5 million outstanding in letters of credit. Genesis Energy, Inc., our 100% owned subsidiary that is the general partner of Genesis, may, as general partner, be a potential guarantor of the bank debt of Genesis, which consists of $80.0 million in debt and $5.3 million in letters of credit at December 31, 2007. There were no guarantees by Denbury or any of its other subsidiaries of the debt of Genesis or of Genesis Energy, Inc. at December 31, 2007. We do not have any material transactions with related parties other than sales of production, transportation arrangements, capital leases with Genesis made in the ordinary course of business, and volumetric production payments of CO2 (VPP) sold to Genesis as discussed in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The anticipated conveyance of our CO2 pipelines to Genesis would require payments over a minimum of 20 years and is not included in the commitment table below (see 2007 Overview Genesis Transactions). If consummated, we anticipate capitalizing these transactions for accounting purposes, and currently project that we will initially pay Genesis approximately $30 million per annum under the lease financing and transportation agreement (and a lesser pro rated amount for 2008), with future payments for the NEJD Pipeline fixed at $20.7 million per year during the 20 year service term of the financing lease, and the payments relating to the Free State Pipeline dependant on the volumes of CO2 transported thereon, with a minimum annual payment for the Free State Pipeline of $1.2 million. We currently have long term commitments to purchase manufactured CO2 from three proposed gasification plants, if these plants are built, two proposed by the developers of Faustina Hydrogen Products LLC and another by Rentech Inc. If all three plants are built, these synthetic sources are currently anticipated to provide us with an aggregate of 750 MMcf/d to 850 MMcf/d of CO2 by 2013. The base price of CO2 per Mcf from these synthetic sources is currently expected to be 1.5 to 2.0 times higher than our most recent all in cost of CO2 from our natural sources (Jackson Dome) using current oil prices and assuming comparable compression levels. These predicted synthetic CO2 prices are expected to be competitive with the cost of our natural CO2 after adjusting for our share of potential carbon emissions credits using estimated current prices of CO2 carbon credit futures. If all three plants are built, the aggregate purchase obligation for this CO2 would be around $190 million per year, assuming a $90 per barrel oil price and comparable compression levels, before any potential savings from our share of carbon emissions credits. All of the contracts have price adjustments that fluctuate based on the price of oil. Construction has not yet commenced on any of these plants, and their construction is contingent on the satisfactory resolution of various issues, including financing; although based on their public representations, the initial Faustina plant is currently scheduled to begin construction during 2008, with completion scheduled in late 2010 or 2011. These amounts are not included in the table below as these payments are contingent on the plants being built. 34 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations A summary of our obligations at December 31, 2007, is presented in the following table: Payments Due by Period Amounts in Thousands Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Subordinated debt (a) $ 525,000 $ $ $ $ $ $ 525,000 Senior Bank Loan (a) 150,000 150,000 Estimated interest payments on subordinated debt and Senior Bank Loan (a) 301,705 48,613 48,612 48,613 45,879 39,375 70,613 Operating lease obligations 143,768 17,580 17,128 16,745 16,185 14,957 61,173 Capital lease obligations (b) 8,738 1,291 1,529 1,291 1,291 1,242 2,094 Capital expenditure obligations (c) 166,041 113,628 50,658 1,755 Derivative contracts payment (d) 23,914 23,914 Hastings Field purchase option 5,000 5,000 Other Cash Commitments: Future development costs on proved oil and gas reserves, net of capital obligations (e) 530,778 179,033 143,053 103,168 41,940 21,250 42,334 Future development cost on proved CO2 reserves, net of capital obligations (f) 133,894 46,794 11,000 76,100 Asset retirement obligations (g) 100,530 2,685 2,251 3,762 1,285 747 89,800 Total $ 2,089,368 $ 438,538 $ 274,231 $ 175,334 $ 256,580 $ 77,571 $ 867,114 (a) These long term borrowings and related interest payments are further discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This table assumes that our long term debt is held until maturity. (b) Represents future minimum cash commitments of $7.0 million to Genesis under capital leases in place at December 31, 2007, primarily for transportation of crude oil and CO2, $1.5 million for our office in Laurel, Mississippi, and auto leases for $0.2 million. Approximately $2.3 million of these payments represents interest. (c) Represents future minimum cash commitments under contracts in place as of December 31, 2007, primarily for pipe, drilling rig services and well related costs. As is common in our industry, we commit to make certain expenditures on a regular basis as part of our ongoing development and exploration program. These commitments generally relate to projects that occur during the subsequent several months and are usually part of our normal operating expenses or part of our capital budget, which for 2008 is currently set at $900 million. In certain cases we have the ability to terminate contracts for equipment in which case we would only be liable for the cost incurred by the vendor up to that point; however, as we currently do not anticipate cancelling those contracts these amounts include our estimated payments under those contracts. We also have recurring expenditures for such things as accounting, engineering and legal fees, software maintenance, subscriptions, and other overhead type items. Normally these expenditures do not change materially on an aggregate basis from year to year and are part of our general and administrative expenses. We have not attempted to estimate the amounts of these types of recurring expenditures in this table as most could be quickly cancelled with regard to any specific vendor, even though the expense itself may be required for ongoing normal operations of the Company. (d) Represents the estimated future payments under our oil and gas derivative contracts based on the futures market prices as of December 31, 2007. These amounts will change as oil and natural gas commodity prices change. The estimated fair market value of our oil and natural gas commodity derivatives at December 31, 2007, was a $23.3 million net liability. See further discussion of our derivative contracts and their market price sensitivities in Market Risk Management below in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (e) Represents projected capital costs as scheduled in our December 31, 2007 proved reserve report that are necessary in order to recover our proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves. These are not contractual commitments and are net of any other capital obligations shown under Contractual Obligations in the table above. (f) Represents projected capital costs as scheduled in our December 31, 2007 proved reserve report that are necessary in order to recover our proved undeveloped CO2 reserves from our CO2 source wells used to produce CO2 for our tertiary operations. These are not contractual commitments and are net of any other capital obligations shown above. (g) Represents the estimated future asset retirement obligations on an undiscounted basis. The present discounted asset retirement obligation is $41.3 million, as determined under SFAS No. 143, and is further discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During November 2006 we entered into an agreement that gives us an option on September 1, 2008, and September 1, 2009, to be effective on the following January 1st, to purchase an interest in Hastings Field, a strategically significant potential tertiary flood candidate located near Houston, Texas. The agreement provides for the parties to agree upon a purchase price for the conventional proved reserves at the time of the exercise of the 35 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations option, which may be paid in cash or through a volumetric production payment; failing an agreement as to price, the price will be determined by a pre designated independent petroleum engineering firm using specified criteria for calculation of the discounted present value of proved reserves at that time. As consideration for the option agreement, to date we have paid $45 million under this option and have a remaining payment due in November 2008 of $5.0 million. We can extend the option period beyond November 2009 for up to seven additional years at an incremental cost of $30 million per year. None of the option payment amounts will be credited against the purchase price if we exercise the option. If we exercise the option, we will be committed to make aggregate net capital expenditures in the field totaling approximately $175 million over the subsequent five years to develop the field for tertiary operations, with an obligation to commence CO2 injections in the field within three years following the option exercise. The above table does not include the commitments related to Hastings Field if the purchase option is exercised by us, as the obligation is at our option. The above table does include the remaining $5.0 million due on the Hastings option payment. Long term contracts require us to deliver CO2 to our industrial CO2 customers at various contracted prices, plus we have a CO2 delivery obligation to Genesis pursuant to three volumetric production payments (VPP) entered into during 2003 through 2005. Based upon the maximum amounts deliverable as stated in the industrial contracts and the volumetric production payments, we estimate that we may be obligated to deliver up to 562 Bcf of CO2 to these customers over the next 20 years; however, since the group as a whole has historically taken less CO2 than the maximum allowed in their contracts, based on the current level of deliveries, we project that our commitment would likely be reduced to approximately 268 Bcf. The maximum volume required in any given year is approximately 142 MMcf/d, although based on our current level of deliveries this would likely be reduced to approximately 72 MMcf/d. Given the size of our proven CO2 reserves at December 31, 2007 (approximately 5.6 Tcf before deducting approximately 182.3 Bcf for the three VPPs), our current production capabilities and our projected levels of CO2 usage for our own tertiary flooding program, we believe that we will be able to meet these delivery obligations. Results of Operations CO2 Operations Overview. Since we acquired our first carbon dioxide tertiary flood in Mississippi in 1999, our interest in tertiary operations has increased to the point that approximately 72% of our current 2008 capital budget is dedicated to tertiary related operations. We particularly like this play as (i) it has a lower risk and is more predictable than most traditional exploration and development activities, (ii) it provides a reasonable rate of return at relatively low oil prices (generally around $30 a barrel at todays cost levels, depending on the specific field and area), and (iii) we have virtually no competition for this type of activity in our geographic area. Generally, from East Texas to Florida, there are no known significant natural sources of CO2 except our own, and these large volumes of CO2 that we own drive the play. We talk about our tertiary operations by labeling operating areas or groups of fields as phases. Phase I is in Southwest Mississippi and includes several fields along our 183 mile NEJD CO2 Pipeline that we acquired in 2001. The most significant fields in this area are Little Creek, Mallalieu, McComb and Brookhaven. Phase II, which began with the early 2006 completion of the Free State CO2 Pipeline to East Mississippi, includes Eucutta, Soso, Martinville and Heidelberg Fields. Tinsley Field located northwest of Jackson, Mississippi, acquired in January 2006, is our Phase III and is serviced by that portion of the Delta CO2 Pipeline completed in January 2008. Phase IV includes Cranfield and Lake St. John Fields, two fields near the Mississippi/Louisiana border located west of the Phase I fields, and Phase V is Delhi Field, a Louisiana field we acquired in 2006, located southwest of Tinsley Field. Flooding in Phase V will begin in 2009 upon completion of the Delta CO2 Pipeline from Tinsley to Delhi. Citronelle Field in Southwest Alabama, another field acquired in 2006, is our Phase VI which will require an extension to the Free State CO2 Pipeline, the timing of which is uncertain at this time. Our last two currently existing phases will require completion of our proposed Green Pipeline, a 300 mile CO2 pipeline which will run from Southern Louisiana to near Houston, Texas, and is scheduled for completion in late 2009 or 2010. Hastings Field, a field on which we acquired a purchase option in late 2006 (see Commitments and Contingencies), is our Phase VII, and the Seabreeze Complex, acquired in 2007, will be our Phase VIII (see 2007 Overview 2007 Acquisitions). CO2 Resources. Since we acquired the CO2 source field located near Jackson, Mississippi, in 2001, we have continued to develop the field and have increased the proven CO2 reserves from approximately 800 Bcf at the time 36 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the acquisition to approximately 5.6 Tcf as of December 31, 2007. During 2007, our proven CO2 reserves increased approximately 5%, or 295 Bcf (excluding 2007 production). The estimate of 5.6 Tcf of proved CO2 reserves is based on 100% ownership of the CO2 reserves, of which Denburys net revenue interest ownership is approximately 4.5 Tcf. Both reserve estimates are included in the evaluation of proven CO2 reserves prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton. In discussing the available CO2 reserves, we make reference to the gross amount of proved reserves, as this is the amount that is available for Denburys tertiary recovery programs, Genesis, and industrial users, as Denbury is responsible for distributing the entire CO2 production stream for both of these uses. We currently estimate that it will take approximately 2.4 Tcf of CO2 to develop and produce the proved tertiary recovery reserves we have recorded at December 31, 2007, in Phases I and II. Today, we own every known producing CO2 well in the region, providing us a significant strategic advantage in the acquisition of other properties in Mississippi and Louisiana that could be further exploited through tertiary recovery. As of February 20, 2008, we estimate that we are capable of producing approximately 700 MMcf/d of CO2, over six times the rate that we were capable of producing at the time of our initial acquisition in 2001. We continue to drill additional CO2 wells, with five more wells planned for 2008, in order to further increase our production capacity and potentially increase our proven CO2 reserves. Our drilling activity at Jackson Dome will continue beyond 2008 as our current forecasts for the existing eight phases suggest that we will need approximately 1.4 Bcf/d of CO2 production by 2012. In addition to using CO2 for our tertiary operations, we sell CO2 to third party industrial users under long term contracts. Most of these industrial contracts have been sold to Genesis along with the sale of a volumetric production payment for the CO2. Our average daily CO2 production during 2005, 2006 and 2007 was approximately 242 million, 342 million and 493 million cubic feet per day, respectively, of which approximately 73% in 2005, 75% in 2006 and 81% in 2007 was used in our tertiary recovery operations, with the balance delivered to Genesis under the volumetric production payments or sold to third party industrial users. We spent approximately $0.21 per Mcf in operating expenses to produce our CO2 during 2007, more than our 2006 average of $0.19 per Mcf and our 2005 average of $0.16 per Mcf, with the higher costs each year primarily due to higher oil costs, which impacts the amount we pay royalty owners for the CO2, and higher operating costs. Our estimated total cost per thousand cubic feet of CO2 during 2007 was approximately $0.29, after inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense related to the CO2 production, as compared to approximately $0.28 during 2006 and $0.25 during 2005. Man Made CO2 Sources. In addition to our natural source of CO2, we are in discussions with the owners of several possible gasification plants which, if built, will convert coal or petroleum coke into various other fuels, with CO2 being a significant by product of the process. We expect these plants to provide us with significant additional sources of CO2 in the future which would enable us to further expand our tertiary operations, although the earliest source of this manufactured CO2 is not expected to be available to us until late 2010 or 2011. We have entered into long term commitments to purchase manufactured CO2 from three proposed plants (see Commitments and Obligations), which, if all three plants are built, are currently anticipated to provide us with an aggregate of 750 MMcf/d to 850 MMcf/d of CO2 by 2013. While we are uncertain as to whether these three specific plants will be built, we anticipate that some gasification plants will be built within the next several years. If correct in our assumptions, we believe that we are a likely purchaser of CO2 produced from such plants built in our area of operations because of the scale of our tertiary operations, the CO2 pipeline infrastructure that we are continuing to develop, and the large natural source of CO2 (Jackson Dome), which can act as a swing CO2 producer if needed. Overview of Tertiary Economics. When we began our tertiary operations several years ago, they were generally economic at oil prices below $20 per Bbl, although the economics varied by field. Our costs have escalated during the last few years due to general cost inflation in the industry, raising our current economic oil price to around $30 per Bbl, again dependent on the specific field. Our inception to date finding and development costs (including future development and abandonment costs but excluding expenditures on fields without proven reserves) for our tertiary oil fields through December 31, 2007, are approximately $9.75 per BOE. Currently, we forecast that these costs will range from $5 to $10 per BOE over the life of each field, depending on the state of a particular field at the time we begin operations, the amount of potential oil, the proximity to a pipeline or other facilities, etc. Our operating costs for tertiary operations are expected to range from $15.00 to $20.00 per BOE over the life of each field (at todays prices), again depending on the field itself. 37 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations While these economic factors have wide ranges, our rate of return from these operations has generally been better than our rate of return on traditional oil and gas operations, and thus our tertiary operations have become our single most important focus area. While it is extremely difficult to accurately forecast future production, we do believe that our tertiary recovery operations provide significant long term production growth potential at reasonable rates of return, with relatively low risk, and thus will be the backbone of our Companys growth for the foreseeable future. Although we believe that our plans and projections are reasonable and achievable, there could be delays or unforeseen problems in the future that could delay or affect the economics of our overall tertiary development program. We believe that such delays or price effects, if any, should only be temporary. Financial Statement Impact of CO2 Operations. Our increasing emphasis on CO2 tertiary recovery projects has significantly impacted and will continue to impact our financial results and certain operating statistics. First, there is a significant delay between the initial capital expenditures on these fields and the resulting production increases, as we must build facilities before CO2 flooding can commence, and it usually takes six to 12 months before the field responds to the injection of CO2 (i.e., oil production commences). Further, we may spend significant amounts of capital before we can recognize any proven reserves from fields we flood (see Analysis of CO2 Tertiary Recovery Operating Activities below). Even after a field has proven reserves, there will usually be significant amounts of additional capital required to fully develop the field. Second, these tertiary projects are usually more expensive to operate than our other oil fields because of the cost of injecting and recycling the CO2 (primarily due to the significant energy requirements to re compress the CO2 back into a near liquid state for re injection purposes). As commodity and energy prices increase, so do our operating expenses in these fields. Most of our CO2 operating expenses are allocated to our oil fields and recorded as lease operating expenses on those fields at the time the CO2 is injected. Since we expense all of the operating costs to produce and inject our CO2, the operating costs per barrel will be higher at the inception of CO2 injection projects because of little or minimal related oil production at that time. Commencing in 2008, we plan to capitalize the cost of CO2 and related operating costs until production commences, which may slightly reduce our cost per BOE (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Significant Accounting Policies Tertiary Injection Costs). Our total corporate operating expenses on a per BOE basis will likely continue to increase as these operations constitute an increasingly larger percentage of our operations. Generally, these higher operating costs are somewhat offset by lower finding and development costs which helps to lower our overall depreciation and depletion rate (see also Overview of Tertiary Economics above and Analysis of CO2 Tertiary Recovery Operating Activities below). Analysis of CO2 Tertiary Recovery Operating Activities. We currently have tertiary operations ongoing at almost all Phase I fields, and Soso, Martinville and Eucutta Fields in Phase II, and we are currently injecting CO2 at Tinsley Field in Phase III. We project that our oil production from our CO2 operations will increase substantially over the next several years as we continue to expand this program by adding additional projects and phases. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 69.5 MMBbls of proven oil reserves related to tertiary operations (48.3 MMBbls in Phase I and the balance in Phase II) and have identified and estimate significant additional oil potential in other fields that we own in this region. We added 12.7 MMBbls of tertiary related proved oil reserves during 2007, primarily initial proven tertiary oil reserves at Soso and Martinville Fields (Phase II). Prior to 2006, we booked most of our proven tertiary oil reserves near the start of a project as almost all the oil fields in Phase I were analogous to Little Creek Field (our first flood) and thus it was not necessary to have an oil production response to the CO2 injections before they were considered proven. Conversely, our new floods (after Phase I) are not analogous (for the most part), as the tertiary floods will be in different geological formations. Therefore, for these new phases, there must be an oil production response to the CO2 injections before we can recognize proven oil reserves, even though we believe that these formations have a similar risk profile. The magnitude of proven reserves that we can book in any given year will depend on our progress with new floods and the timing of the production response. Our average annual oil production from our CO2 tertiary recovery activities has increased during the last few years, from 3,970 Bbls/d in 2002 to 14,767 Bbls/d during 2007. Tertiary oil production represented approximately 53% of our total corporate oil production during 2007 and approximately 33% of our total corporate production of both oil and natural gas during the same period on a BOE basis. We expect that this tertiary related oil production will continue to increase, although the increases are not always predictable or consistent. While we may have temporary fluctuation in oil production related to tertiary operations, this does not indicate any issue with the proved 38 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and potential oil reserves recoverable with CO2, because the historical correlation between oil production and CO2 injections remains high. A detailed discussion of each of our tertiary oil fields and the development of each is included on pages 8 10 under Our Tertiary Oil Fields With Proved Tertiary Reserves. Following is a chart with our tertiary oil production by field for 2005 and 2006, and by quarter for 2007. In 2007, we saw continued improved response from our newer Phase II floods at Martinville, Eucutta and Soso Fields, most of which were initiated during 2006. In addition, we continue to see improved response at most of our other floods in Phase I, except for Little Creek Field, which is a mature flood and is expected to continue to gradually decline over the next several years.

We also lease a portion of our recycling and plant equipment used in our tertiary operations, which further increases operating expenses. Over the last five years we have leased certain equipment that qualifies for operating lease treatment representing an underlying aggregate cost of approximately $98.5 million as of December 31, 2007. These leases have been an attractive method of financing due to their low imputed interest rates, which are fixed for seven to ten years. Also, the cost to produce our CO2 has gradually increased (see CO2 Resources above), all of which resulted in an increase in our tertiary operating cost per BOE from $12.00 per BOE during 2005, to $17.69 per BOE in 2006, to $19.77 per BOE in 2007. The absolute amount of operating expenses related to tertiary operations increased from $40.4 million during 2005, to $65.0 million during 2006, to $106.5 million during 2007. Through December 31, 2007, we have invested a total of $1.0 billion on fields currently being flooded (including allocated acquisition costs) and have $250.8 million in unrecovered net cash flow (revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures). Of this total, approximately $351.3 million (35%) was spent on fields which had little or no proved reserves at December 31, 2007 (i.e., fields for which significant incremental proved reserves are anticipated during 2008 and beyond). The proved oil reserves in our CO2 fields have a PV 10 Value of $3.2 billion, using December 31, 2007, constant NYMEX pricing of $95.98 per Bbl. These amounts do not include the capital costs or related depreciation and amortization of our CO2 producing properties, but do include CO2 source field lease operating costs and transportation costs. Through December 31, 2007, we had a balance of approximately $371.0 million of unrecovered net cash flows for our CO2 producing properties and CO2 pipelines. CO2 Source Related Capital Budget for 2008. Tentatively, we plan to spend approximately $90 million in 2008 in the Jackson Dome area with the intent to add additional CO2 reserves and deliverability for future operations. Approximately $235 million in capital expenditures is budgeted in 2008 at the oil field level in Phases I through V, plus an additional $325 million for our Delta and Green CO2 Pipelines, making our combined CO2 related expenditures just over 72% of our $900 million 2008 capital budget. Operating Results Net income and cash flow from operations have increased each year during the last three years. Production increased 23% between 2005 and 2006, and 20% between 2006 and 2007, which, coupled with higher prices, resulted in record annual net income and cash flow. 39 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

The production increases in 2007 were primarily from increased oil production from our tertiary operations and increased production from the Barnett Shale, partially reduced by declines in production from our onshore Louisiana properties. During 2006, the most significant production increases were from the Barnett Shale and our acquisition of Tinsley and Citronelle Fields in January 2006, which contributed approximately 2,148 BOE/d of the increase (36%), with 1,122 BOE/d attributable to the Mississippi non CO2 floods and 1,026 BOE/d to Alabama fields, although a small portion of that increase was from our internal development efforts following the acquisition. Production in the Mississippi non CO2 floods area decreased slightly each year from the prior year (before giving effect to the January 2006 acquisition related increase noted above), as this area is on a gradual decline from normal depletion, partially offset by drilling activity developing the Selma Chalk natural gas reservoir in the Heidelberg area. See CO2 Operations above for a discussion of the tertiary related production. The general decrease in onshore Louisiana production in 2007 is due primarily to the expected relatively rapid depletion of wells in this area as we have focused less of our spending and activity in this area than we have historically. We closed on the divesture of these assets, excluding any oil fields that could have tertiary oil potential, in December 2007 and February 2008 (see 2007 Overview Sale of Louisiana Natural Gas Assets). The increase in production during 2006 in this area was a result of a higher level of activity during 2005 and early 2006 before the decision was made to sell the properties in this area. Our production in the Barnett Shale area during 2007 increased 4,690 BOE/d (97% increase) over our 2006 level, and during 2006 increased 2,723 BOE/d (127% increase) over our 2005 level, primarily as a result of higher drilling activity levels than in 2005. We drilled and completed 45 wells during 2007 and 46 wells during 2006, as compared to 23 wells drilled during 2005, and plan to drill 45 to 50 wells during 2008. We had four rigs working in the area during most of the first quarter of 2007, but in the second quarter reduced our rig count in this area to three, which we retained for the remainder of 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we processed our natural gas through a different gas plant, increasing the amount of liquids we recovered by 2,469 BOE/d, the primary reason for 41 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations the increased production that quarter. We believe that our fourth quarter of 2007 production has peaked, or is near its peak, from this area, based on the anticipated level of future drilling activity. These wells are characterized by steep decline rates in their first year of production (typically 50% to 60%), followed by a gradual leveling off of production and a resultant slow decline rate, giving them an overall long production life. The Texas property acquisition we made late in the first quarter of 2007 (see 2007 Overview 2007 Acquisitions) contributed approximately 524 BOE/d to the 2007 average production from this area. Our production for 2007 was 63% oil as compared to 62% during 2006 and 67% in 2005, as the recent increases in natural gas production in the Barnett Shale area and fluctuating natural gas production in Louisiana have generally been matched by increases in our tertiary oil production. Oil and Natural Gas Revenues. Our oil and natural gas revenues have increased for each of the last two years, as both overall commodity prices and production were higher. The increase in production in 2007 increased oil and natural gas revenues by $142.9 million, or 20%, while the increase in overall commodity prices increased revenues by $93.4 million, or 13%, over the prior years levels. The increase in production in 2006 increased oil and natural gas revenues by $128.8 million, or 23%, while the increase in overall commodity prices increased revenues by $38.7 million, or 6%, over the prior years levels. Excluding any impact of our derivative contracts, our net realized commodity prices and NYMEX differentials were as follows during 2007, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net Realized Prices: Oil price per Bbl $ 69.80 $ 59.87 $ 50.30 Gas price per Mcf 6.81 7.10 8.48 Price per BOE 59.17 53.37 50.49 NYMEX Differentials: Oil per Bbl $ (2.65 ) $ (6.41 ) $ (6.33 ) Natural Gas per Mcf (0.28 ) 0.13 (0.49 ) Our oil NYMEX differential during 2007 was the lowest in our corporate history. The improved NYMEX differential during 2007 was related to higher prices received for both our light sweet barrels and our sour barrels primarily as a result of NYMEX (WTI) prices being depressed due to lack of available storage capacity in the mid continent area, an oversupply of crude from Canada, capacity/transportation issues in moving crude oil out of the Cushing, Oklahoma, area and unanticipated refinery outages. This trend reversed itself by the fourth quarter of 2007, with average NYMEX oil differentials during that quarter of $(7.27) per Bbl, higher than our historical averages due to the significant increase in liquids extracted from our natural gas production in the Barnett Shale which is recorded as oil production, but sells at a significant discount to NYMEX (see also Results of Operations Production above). Our natural gas NYMEX differentials are generally caused by movement in the NYMEX natural gas prices during a month as most of our natural gas is sold on an index price that is set near the first of the month. While the percentage change in the above table is quite large, these differentials are very seldom more than a dollar above or below the NYMEX amount. Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Contracts. During 2007, we had significant fluctuations in our pre tax income related to non cash fair value adjustments in our oil and natural gas derivative contracts (expense of $35.2 million in the first quarter, income of $13.3 million in the second quarter, expense of $5.4 million in the third quarter and expense of $11.8 million in the fourth quarter), while at the same time, during each quarter in 2007 we had net positive cash receipts on the settlements of our commodity derivative contracts, aggregating $20.5 million during the year, all related to our 2007 natural gas swaps, partially offset by payments on our oil swaps. In comparison, during 2006, we made payments on our derivative contracts of $5.3 million, related to oil swaps put in place in late 2005 to protect the rate of return on the fields acquired in January 2006. During 2005, we made payments on our derivative contracts of $16.8 million related to a natural gas collar. 42 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Changing commodity prices cause fluctuations in the mark to market value adjustments of our derivative contracts. During 2007, we expensed $24.6 million related to our natural gas swaps, primarily offsetting the gain we recognized on the same swaps in late 2006 as the swaps had expired by the end of 2007. We also expensed $14.5 million related to our oil swaps as a result of the increasing oil price. We recognized a non cash gain of $25.1 million in 2006 as a result of the decreasing prices, primarily related to the 75 MMcf/d of natural gas swaps for calendar 2007 that we entered into during December 2006. During 2005, because of our decision to abandon hedge accounting as of January 1, 2005, we recognized a non cash expense of $12.2 million primarily related to the amortization of the fair value of the derivative contracts in place as of January 1, 2005, over the remaining life of the contracts, which was generally 2005. See also Market Risk Management and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more discussion of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts. Operating Expenses. Our lease operating expenses have increased each year on both a per BOE basis and in absolute dollars primarily as a result of (i) our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations (see discussion of those expenses under CO2 Operations above), (ii) higher overall industry costs, (iii) increased personnel and related costs, (iv) higher fuel and energy costs to operate our properties, and (v) increasing lease payments for certain of our tertiary operating facilities and equipment. During 2007, operating costs averaged $14.34 per BOE, up from $12.46 per BOE during 2006, and $9.98 per BOE in 2005. Operating expenses for our tertiary operations were $106.5 million in 2007, up from $65.0 million during 2006, and $40.4 million during 2005, all as a result of increased tertiary activity. Tertiary operating expenses were particularly impacted by higher power and energy costs, higher costs for CO2, and payments on leased facilities and equipment (see CO2 Operations above). We expect this increase in tertiary operating costs to continue and to further increase our cost per BOE as these costs become a more significant portion of our total production and operations. Further, the sale of our Louisiana natural gas properties (see 2007 Overview Sale of Louisiana Natural Gas Properties) will further increase our corporate average operating cost per BOE in the future. If the sold properties were excluded from our operating results for the entire year of 2007, our operating costs would have been approximately $15.47 per BOE, approximately $1.13 per BOE higher than as reported. Production taxes and marketing expenses generally change in proportion to commodity prices and therefore have been higher in each of the last three years along with the increasing commodity prices. Transportation and plant processing fees were approximately $6.9 million higher in 2007 than in 2006 and approximately $0.8 million higher in 2006 than in 2005, largely associated with the incremental production and incremental plant processing fees related to our Barnett Shale production. General and Administrative Expenses During the last three years, general and administrative (GA) expenses have increased on a gross basis, while fluctuating on a per BOE basis as outlined below: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net GA expense (thousands) Gross GA expense $ 115,519 $ 96,479 $ 64,622 State franchise taxes 2,915 1,825 1,454 Operator labor and overhead recovery charges (59,145 ) (47,667 ) (32,452 ) Capitalized exploration and development costs (10,317 ) (7,623 ) (5,084 ) Net GA expense $ 48,972 $ 43,014 $ 28,540 Average GA cost per BOE $ 3.04 $ 3.20 $ 2.62 Employees as of December 31 686 596 460 Gross GA expenses increased $19.0 million, or 20% between 2006 and 2007, and $31.9 million, or 49%, between 2005 and 2006. The increases are primarily due to higher compensation and personnel related costs caused by an increase in the number of employees, and higher wages as a result of average salary increases of between 5% and 10% during 2006 and 2007, which we consider necessary in order to remain competitive in our industry. During 2006, we increased our employee count by 30%, and we further increased our employee count 15% during 2007. Partially offsetting these overall compensation increases were $6.0 million of non recurring charges related to the retirement and departure of two vice presidents during 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in January 2006 43 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations increased gross GA expense by approximately $8.9 million during 2006, representing the non cash charge for stock compensation (stock options and stock appreciation rights) pertaining to personnel charged to GA. Stock compensation expense reflected in gross GA was $12.2 million during 2007, $18.9 million during 2006 and $4.2 million during 2005. Higher operator overhead recovery charges resulting from incremental activity helped to partially offset the increase in gross GA. Our well operating agreements allow us, when we are the operator, to charge a well with a specified overhead rate during the drilling phase and also to charge a monthly fixed overhead rate for each producing well. As a result of the additional operated wells from acquisitions, additional tertiary operations, increased drilling activity and increased compensation expense (including the allocation of that portion of stock compensation charged to lease operating expense), the amount we recovered as operator labor and overhead charges increased by 24% between 2006 and 2007, and 47% between 2005 and 2006. Capitalized exploration and development costs increased each year primarily due to additional personnel and increased compensation costs, and the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in January 2006. The net effect of the increases in gross GA expenses, operator overhead recoveries and capitalized exploration costs was a 14% increase in net GA expense between 2006 and 2007, and a 51% increase in net GA expense between 2005 and 2006. On a per BOE basis, GA decreased 5% in 2007 as compared to 2006 as the higher production more than offset the increase in gross costs, but GA per BOE increased 22% in 2006 as compared to 2005 levels. Interest and Financing Expenses Year Ended December 31, Amounts in thousands, except per BOE data 2007 2006 2005 Cash interest expense $ 49,205 $ 33,787 $ 18,800 Non cash interest expense 2,010 1,121 827 Less: Capitalized interest (20,385 ) (11,333 ) (1,649 ) Interest expense $ 30,830 $ 23,575 $ 17,978 Interest and other income $ 5,532 $ 6,379 $ 3,532 Average net cash interest expense per BOE (1) $ 1.43 $ 1.26 $ 1.28 Average debt outstanding $ 672,376 $ 455,603 $ 248,825 Average interest rate (2) 7.3 % 7.4 % 7.6 % (1) Cash interest expense less capitalized interest and other income on a BOE basis. (2) Includes commitment fees but excludes amortization of debt issue costs. Interest expense has increased each of the last two years corresponding to our increase in average debt levels as we used debt to fund a $250 million acquisition in January 2006, other lower cost acquisitions in 2006 and 2007, and to fund a portion of our capital spending, which in 2007 was significantly in excess of our cash flow from operations. These increases in cash interest have been partially offset by higher interest amounts capitalized on our significant unevaluated properties, primarily related to our 2006 acquisition, continued expansion of our tertiary operations and construction of our CO2 pipelines. The average interest rate has been relatively unchanged because our subordinated debt, which was 89% of the total 2007 average debt, 82% of the total 2006 average debt, and 93% of the total 2005 average debt, is a fixed interest rate. 44 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization (DDA) Year Ended December 31, Amounts in thousands, except per BOE data 2007 2006 2005 Depletion and depreciation of oil and natural gas properties $ 174,356 $ 132,880 $ 88,949 Depletion and depreciation of CO2 assets 11,609 8,375 5,334 Asset retirement obligations 2,977 2,389 1,682 Depreciation of other fixed assets 6,958 5,521 2,837 Total DDA $ 195,900 $ 149,165 $ 98,802 DDA per BOE: Oil and natural gas properties $ 11.02 $ 10.08 $ 8.34 CO2 assets and other fixed assets 1.15 1.03 0.75 Total DDA cost per BOE $ 12.17 $ 11.11 $ 9.09 Our proved reserves increased from 152.6 MMBOE as of December 31, 2005, to 174.3 MMBOE as of December 31, 2006, and further increased to 194.7 MMBOE as of December 31, 2007. Reserve quantities and associated production are only one side of the DDA equation, with capital expenditures less accumulated depletion, asset retirement obligations less related salvage value, and projected future development costs making up the remainder of the calculation. We adjust our DDA rate each quarter for significant changes in our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and costs, and thus our DDA rate could change significantly in the future. Our DDA rate per BOE increased 10% between 2006 and 2007, and 22% between 2005 and 2006, primarily due to capital spending and increased costs. We added approximately 22.8 MMBOE and 17.8 MMBOE of reserves in the Barnett Shale and approximately 12.7 MMBOE and 6.0 MMBOE in our tertiary oil properties during 2007 and 2006, respectively, and only minor amounts elsewhere. Further, as a result of rising industry costs, we not only exceeded our cost estimates on our projects over the last two years, but also increased our future development costs on our proved undeveloped reserves to reflect these rising costs. In general, 2006 was a transition year for us with regard to recording proved tertiary oil reserves. Prior to 2006, many of our tertiary floods could be considered proven near the start of a project as they were analogous to Little Creek Field (an already producing tertiary flood) and thus it was not necessary to have a production response to CO2 injections before we recognized proved reserves. Conversely, since that time, most of our new floods are not analogous and thus must have an oil production response to the CO2 injections before we can recognize tertiary proved oil reserves in these fields, even though we believe there is a similar risk profile in flooding these fields. During 2006, two of our most significant new floods were Soso and Martinville Fields (Phase II), for which reserves were not booked until 2007 after we had a significant production response. During 2007, we initiated floods at Lockhart Crossing (Phase I), Tinsley (Phase III) and Cranfield (Phase IV) that will not result in additional proved reserves until we have a production response, which is expected in 2008. We expect this same delay factor to continue in the future with regard to recording most of our projected proved tertiary reserves, although we expect our proved reserves to increase more rapidly in the future because of the projected size and magnitude of the potential reserves from projects either started or planned. We allocated approximately $33.9 million of the $39.4 million adjusted purchase price of our March 31, 2007 Seabreeze acquisition, $124 million of our $250 million January 2006 acquisition costs for Tinsley, Citronelle and South Cypress Creek Fields, and virtually all of the second quarter 2006 $50 million Delhi acquisition costs to unevaluated properties to reflect the significant potential reserves associated with future tertiary floods that we considered to be part of these acquisitions. As a result, these acquisitions did not materially impact our overall DDA rate, as the amount included in our full cost pool was a cost per BOE relatively consistent with our overall DDA rate. Our DDA rate for our CO2 and other fixed assets increased in both 2006 and 2007 as a result of the building of our Free State CO2 Pipeline to Eastern Mississippi, which went into service late in the first quarter of 2006, additional costs incurred drilling CO2 wells during each year and higher associated future development costs, partially offset by an increase in CO2 reserves from 4.6 Tcf as of December 31, 2005, to 5.5 Tcf as of December 31, 2006, and 5.6 Tcf as of December 31, 2007 (100% working interest basis before amounts attributable to Genesis volumetric production payments see CO2 Operations CO2 Resources). 45 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations As part of the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred, discounted to its present value using our credit adjusted risk free interest rate, with a corresponding capitalized amount. The liability is accreted each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. On an undiscounted basis, we estimated our retirement obligations as of December 31, 2005, to be $69.1 million ($27.1 million present value), with an estimated salvage value of $50.2 million. As of December 31, 2006, we estimated our retirement obligations to be $91.3 million ($41.1 million present value), with an estimated salvage value of $60.0 million, and as of December 31, 2007, we estimated our retirement obligations to be $100.6 million ($41.3 million present value), with an estimated salvage value of $67.3 million, the increase related to our recent acquisitions, increased activity and higher cost estimates due to the inflation in our industry, partially offset by a decrease in our obligation of approximately $9.4 million, ($9.2 million present value) related to the sale of most of our Louisiana natural gas properties in late 2007. DDA is calculated on the increase in retirement obligations recorded as incremental oil and natural gas and CO2 properties, net of its estimated salvage value. We also include the accretion of discount on the asset retirement obligation in our DDA expense. Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation. We did not have any full cost pool ceiling test write downs in 2005, 2006 or 2007. Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, Amounts in thousands, except per BOE amounts 2007 2006 2005 Current income tax expense $ 30,074 $ 19,865 $ 27,177 Deferred income tax provision 110,193 107,252 54,393 Total income tax provision $ 140,267 $ 127,117 $ 81,570 Average income tax provision per BOE $ 8.71 $ 9.47 $ 7.50 Effective tax rate 35.7 % 38.6 % 32.9 % Total net deferred tax asset (liability) $ (334,662 ) $ (229,925 ) $ (129,474 ) Our income tax provision was based on an estimated statutory rate of approximately 38% in 2007, and 39% in 2006 and 2005, adjusted for the impact of certain items such as compensation arising from incentive stock options that cannot be deducted for tax purposes in the same manner as book expense. The reduction in the estimated statutory rate to 38% in 2007 was a result of our sale of our Louisiana natural gas assets during the fourth quarter of 2007. For 2005, our net effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the recognition of enhanced oil recovery credits (EOR) which lowered our overall tax expense. For 2006 and 2007, we did not earn any additional EOR credits because of the high oil prices during 2005 and 2006, which completely phased out our ability to earn any additional credits. In all three periods, the current income tax expense represents our anticipated alternative minimum cash taxes that we cannot offset with EOR credits. As of December 31, 2007, we had an estimated $37 million of EOR credit carryforwards that we can utilize to reduce a portion of our cash taxes. These EOR credits do not begin to expire until 2024. Since the ability to earn additional enhanced oil recovery credits is reduced or even eliminated based on the level of oil prices, we do not expect to earn any EOR credits in the future unless oil prices decrease significantly from current levels. Once our existing EOR credits are utilized, our cash taxes will also increase. 46 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations on a Per BOE Basis The following table summarizes the cash flow, DDA and results of operations on a per BOE basis for the comparative periods. Each of the individual components is discussed above.

These debt agreements expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates. The following table presents the carrying and fair values of our debt, along with average interest rates. We had $150 million of bank debt outstanding as of December 31, 2007, and $111 million outstanding as of February 28, 2008. None of our existing debt has any triggers or covenants regarding our debt ratings with rating agencies. The fair value of the subordinated debt is based on quoted market prices. Expected Maturity Dates Carrying Fair Amounts in thousands 2011 2013 2015 Value Value Variable rate debt: Bank debt (weighted average interest rate of 6.2% at December 31, 2007) $ 150,000 $ $ $ 150,000 $ 150,000 Fixed rate debt: 7.5% subordinated debt due 2013 (fixed rate of 7.5%) 225,000 223,980 227,250 7.5% subordinated debt due 2015 (fixed rate of 7.5%) 300,000 300,685 303,000 From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. These contracts have consisted of price floors, collars and fixed price swaps. Historically, we hedged up to 75% of our anticipated production each year to provide us with a reasonably certain amount of cash flow to cover most of our budgeted exploration and development expenditures without incurring significant debt. Since 2005 and beyond, we have entered into fewer derivative contracts, primarily because of our strong financial position resulting from our lower levels of debt relative to our cash flow from operations. We did enter into natural gas derivative contracts in late 2006 and September 2007 as we believed that there is more risk with regard to natural gas prices and the fact that we planned to spend significantly more than our projected cash flow from operations during the ensuing year (see Capital Resources and Liquidity). In late 2006, we swapped 80% to 90% of our forecasted 2007 natural gas production at a weighted average price of $7.96 per Mcf, and in September 2007 we swapped 70% to 80% of our remaining forecasted 2008 natural gas production 47 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (after the sale of our Louisiana natural gas properties see 2007 Overview Sale of Louisiana Natural Gas Properties) at a weighted average price of $7.91 per Mcf. When we make a significant acquisition, we generally attempt to hedge a large percentage, up to 100%, of the forecasted proved production for the subsequent one to three years following the acquisition in order to help provide us with a minimum return on our investment. As of December 31, 2007, we had derivative contracts in place related to our $250 million acquisition that closed on January 31, 2006, on which we entered into contracts to cover 100% of the estimated proved producing production at the time we signed the purchase and sale agreement. While these derivative contracts related to the acquisition represent between 5% and 6% of our estimated 2008 oil production, they are intended to help protect our acquisition economics related to the first three years of production from the proved producing reserves that we acquired. These swaps cover 2,000 Bbls/d for 2008 at a price of $57.34 per Bbl. All of the mark to market valuations used for our oil and natural gas derivatives are provided by external sources and are based on prices that are actively quoted. We manage and control market and counterparty credit risk through established internal control procedures that are reviewed on an ongoing basis. We attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies, monitoring procedures and diversification. For a full description of our derivative contract positions at year end 2007, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Since January 1, 2005, for accounting purposes, we have elected to account for our oil and natural gas derivative contracts as speculative contracts. This means that any changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion to earnings. During 2005, we amortized the December 31, 2004, balance in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss to earnings as that was the remaining life of those contracts. Information regarding our current derivative contract positions and results of our historical derivative activity is included in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2007, our derivative contracts were recorded at their fair value, which was a net liability of approximately $23.3 million, a decrease of $39.0 million from the $15.7 million fair value asset recorded as of December 31, 2006. This change is primarily related to the recognition of our natural gas hedges which expired during 2007, but were a significant asset at December 31, 2006 (see above), and higher oil prices which reduced the value of the remaining oil swaps. During 2007, we recognized total expenses related to our hedge contracts of $18.6 million, consisting of $20.5 million of net cash receipts on settlements of expired contracts and $39.1 million of expense relating to market to market non cash adjustments. Based on NYMEX crude oil futures prices at December 31, 2007, we would expect to make future cash payments of $26.3 million on our crude oil commodity derivative contracts. If crude oil futures prices were to decline by 10%, we would expect to make future cash payments on our crude oil commodity derivative contracts of $19.5 million, and if futures prices were to increase by 10% we would expect to pay $33.1 million. Based on NYMEX natural gas futures prices at December 31, 2007, we would expect to receive future cash payments of $2.4 million on our natural gas commodity hedges. If natural gas futures prices were to decline by 10%, the amount we would expect to receive under our natural gas commodity hedges would increase to $19.5 million, and if future prices were to increase by 10% we would expect to pay $14.7 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we select certain accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments regarding the application of those policies. Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements. Full Cost Method of Accounting, Depletion and Depreciation and Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Businesses involved in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. We apply the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Another acceptable method of accounting for oil and gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting. In general, the primary differences between the two methods are related to the capitalization 48 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment. Under the full cost method, all geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool, whereas under the successful efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred. In the assessment of impairment of oil and gas properties, the successful efforts method follows the guidance of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, under which the net book value of assets are measured for impairment against the undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method, the full cost pool (net book value of oil and gas properties) is measured against future cash flows discounted at 10% using commodity prices in effect at the end of the reporting period. The financial results for a given period could be substantially different depending on the method of accounting that an oil and gas entity applies. In our application of full cost accounting for our oil and gas producing activities, we make significant estimates at the end of each period related to accruals for oil and gas revenues, production, capitalized costs and operating expenses. We calculate these estimates with our best available data, which includes, among other things, production reports, price posting, information compiled from daily drilling reports and other internal tracking devices, and analysis of historical results and trends. While management is not aware of any required revisions to its estimates, there will likely be future adjustments resulting from such things as changes in ownership interests, payouts, joint venture audits, re allocations by the purchaser/pipeline, or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and natural gas industry, many of which will require retroactive application. These types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated or determined and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs. Under full cost accounting, the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom used to perform the full cost ceiling test have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible, including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare the report, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statement disclosures. Over the last four years, Denburys annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately 2.5% of the previous years estimates and have been both positive and negative. Changes in commodity prices also affect our reserve quantities. During 2005, 2006 and 2007, the change to reserve quantities related to commodity prices was relatively small, less than in prior years, as prices were relatively high each year end. These changes in quantities affect our DDA rate, and the combined effect of changes in quantities and commodity prices impacts our full cost ceiling test calculation. For example, we estimate that a 5% increase in our estimate of proved reserves quantities would have lowered our fourth quarter 2007 DDA rate from $12.05 per Bbl to approximately $11.55 per Bbl, and a 5% decrease in our proved reserve quantities would have increased our DDA rate to approximately $12.60 per Bbl. Also, reserve quantities and their ultimate values are the primary factors in determining the borrowing base under our bank credit facility and are determined solely by our banks. There can also be significant questions as to whether reserves are sufficiently supported by technical evidence to be considered proven. In some cases our proven reserves are less than what we believe to exist because additional evidence, including production testing, is required in order to classify the reserves as proven. We have a corporate policy whereby we generally do not book proved undeveloped reserves unless the project has been committed to internally, which normally means it is scheduled within the subsequent three years (or at least the commencement of the project is scheduled in the case of longer term multi year projects such as waterfloods and tertiary recovery projects). Therefore, with regard to potential reserves, there is uncertainty as to whether the reserves should be included as proven or not. We also have a corporate policy whereby proved undeveloped reserves must be economic at long term historical prices, which are usually significantly less than the year end prices used in our reserve report. This also can have the effect of eliminating certain projects being included in our estimates of proved reserves, which projects would otherwise be included if undeveloped reserves were determined to be economic solely based on current prices in a high price environment, as was the case during the last three year ends. (See Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization under Results of Operations above for further discussion.) All of these factors and the decisions made regarding these issues can have a significant effect on our proven reserves 49 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and thus on our DDA rate, full cost ceiling test calculation, borrowing base and financial statements. See also discussion of requirements to book proven tertiary oil reserves at Results of Operations Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization. Tertiary Injection Cost Our tertiary operations are conducted in reservoirs that have already produced significant amounts of oil over many years; however, in accordance with the rules for recording proved reserves, we cannot recognize proved reserves associated with enhanced recovery techniques, such as CO2 injection, until there is a production response to the injected CO2 or, unless the field is analogous to an existing flood. Our costs associated with the CO2 we produce (or acquire) and inject are principally our costs of production, transportation and acquisition, or to pay royalties. Prior to January 1, 2008, we expensed currently all costs associated with injecting CO2 that we use in our tertiary recovery operations, even though some of these costs were incurred prior to any tertiary related oil production. Commencing January 1, 2008, we will begin capitalizing, as a development cost, injection costs in fields that are in their development stage, which means we have not yet seen incremental oil production due to the CO2 injections (i.e. a production response). These capitalized development costs will be included in our unevaluated property costs within our full cost pool if there are not already proved tertiary reserves in that field. After we see a production response to the CO2 injections (i.e. the production stage), injection costs will be expensed as incurred and any previously deferred unevaluated development costs will become subject to depletion upon recognition of proved tertiary reserves. Based upon the current status of some of our tertiary floods, this change in accounting will cause us to capitalize certain costs that we historically expensed. Had the new method of accounting for tertiary injectant costs been used in periods prior to January 1, 2008, the effect on our financial statements would have been immaterial for all periods presented. Asset Retirement Obligations We have significant obligations related to the plugging and abandonment of our oil, natural gas and CO2 wells, the removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and land restoration. SFAS No. 143 requires that we estimate the future cost of this obligation, discount it to its present value, and record a corresponding asset and liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates, including the ultimate expected cost of the obligation, the expected future date of the required cash payment, and interest and inflation rates. Revisions to these estimates may be required based on changes to cost estimates, the timing of settlement, and changes in legal requirements. Any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis and an adjustment in our DDA expense in future periods. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our asset retirement obligations. Income Taxes We make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. Our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes, tax credits and, prior to year end 2005, net operating loss carryforwards. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns. Further, we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets (primarily our enhanced oil recovery credits). If recovery is not likely, we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover, which would result in an increase to our income tax expense. As of December 31, 2007, we believe that all of our deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet will ultimately be recovered. If our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not probable. A 1% increase in our effective tax rate would have increased our calculated income tax expense by approximately $3.9 million, $3.3 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning our income taxes. 50 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Contracts We enter into oil and natural gas derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with future oil and natural gas production. These contracts have historically consisted of options, in the form of price floors or collars, and fixed price swaps. Under SFAS No. 133, every derivative instrument is required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value. If the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings. If the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (equity) to the extent that the hedge is effective, and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective. As of January 1, 2005, we abandoned hedge accounting. This means that any changes in the future fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the balance to earnings. While we may experience more volatility in our net income than if we had continued to apply hedge accounting treatment as permitted by SFAS No. 133, we believe that for us the benefits associated with applying hedge accounting do not outweigh the cost, time and effort to comply with hedge accounting. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized expense (income) of $39.1 million, ($25.1) million and $4.5 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair market value of our derivative contracts. Stock Compensation Plans Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment using the modified prospective application method described in the statement. Among other items, SFAS No. 123(R) eliminates the use of APB 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the financial statements. Under the modified prospective application method, effective January 1, 2006, we began to recognize compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of December 31, 2005, over the remaining service periods, and for new awards granted or modified after January 1, 2006. We estimate the fair value of stock option or stock appreciation right (SAR) awards on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option valuation model requires the input of somewhat subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and expected term. Other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the Black Scholes model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of the Companys stock. The risk free interest rates used are the U.S. Treasury yield for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant. Our dividend yield is zero, as Denbury does not pay a dividend. We utilize historical experience in arriving at our assumptions for volatility and expected term inputs. We recognize the stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. The expense we recognize is net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate our forfeiture rate based on prior experience and true it up for actual results as the awards vest. As of December 31, 2007, there was $9.8 million of total compensation cost to be recognized in future periods related to non vested stock options and SARs. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.2 years. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires us to make other estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reliable, and believe that the ultimate actual results will not differ significantly from those reported; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and such risks and uncertainties could cause the actual results to differ materially from our estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair 51 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. However, on February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157 2 which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). This FSP partially defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this FSP. Effective for 2008, we will adopt SFAS No. 157 except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in FSP SFAS No. 157 2. We have not yet determined the impact the partial adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, with the objective of improving financial reporting by giving entities the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective for us beginning January 1, 2008. We have not yet determined what impact, if any, this pronouncement will have on our financial condition or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. We have not yet determined what impact, if any, this pronouncement will have on our financial condition or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parents ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. This statement is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. We have not yet determined what impact, if any, this pronouncement will have on our financial condition or results of operations. Forward Looking Information The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements found in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are forward looking statements, as that term is defined in Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be or may concern, among other things, forecasted capital expenditures, drilling activity or methods, acquisition plans and proposals and dispositions, development activities, cost savings, production rates and volumes or forecasts thereof, hydrocarbon reserves, hydrocarbon or expected reserve quantities and values, potential reserves from tertiary operations, hydrocarbon prices, pricing assumptions based on current and projected oil and gas prices, liquidity, regulatory matters, mark to market values, competition, long term forecasts of production, finding cost, rates of return, estimated costs or changes in costs, future capital expenditures and overall economics and other variables surrounding our tertiary operations and future plans. Such forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as plan, estimate, expect, predict, anticipate, projected, should, assume, believe, target or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Such forward looking information is based upon managements current plans, expectations, estimates and assumptions and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect current plans, anticipated actions, the timing of such actions and the Companys financial condition and results of operations. As a consequence, actual results may differ materially from expectations, estimates or assumptions expressed in or implied by any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are: fluctuations of the prices received or demand for the Companys oil and natural gas, inaccurate cost estimates, fluctuations in the prices of goods and services, the uncertainty of drilling results and reserve estimates, operating hazards, acquisition risks, requirements for capital or its availability, general economic conditions, competition and government regulations, and unexpected delays, as well as the risks and uncertainties inherent in oil and gas drilling and production activities 52 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. or which are otherwise discussed in this annual report, including, without limitation, the portions referenced above, and the uncertainties set forth from time to time in the Companys other public reports, filings and public statements.
