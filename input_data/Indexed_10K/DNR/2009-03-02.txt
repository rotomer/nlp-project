Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Our discussion and analysis includes forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with Risk Factors under Item 1A of this report, along with Forward Looking Information at the end of this section for information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than our forward looking statements. Overview We are a growing independent oil and gas company engaged in acquisition, development and exploration activities in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. We are the largest oil and natural gas producer in Mississippi, own the largest reserves of carbon dioxide (CO2) used for tertiary oil recovery east of the Mississippi River, and significant operating acreage in the Barnett Shale play near Fort Worth, Texas, and also hold properties in Southeast Texas. Our goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling, and proven engineering extraction processes, with our most significant emphasis relating to tertiary recovery operations. Our corporate headquarters are in Plano, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), and we have four primary field offices located in Laurel, Mississippi; McComb, Mississippi; Jackson, Mississippi; and Aledo, Texas. Liquidity. During the last six months, we have taken several steps to improve our liquidity as a result of the deterioration in the capital markets and the decrease in oil and natural gas prices (see Capital Resources and Liquidity). 2008 Operating Highlights. Oil and natural gas prices were extremely volatile during 2008, with NYMEX oil prices setting a record high of approximately $145 per Bbl around mid year, followed by a rapid drop during the second half of the year to below $40 per Bbl, a price level not seen since 2004, finishing the year at $44.60 per Bbl. Natural gas prices followed a similar trend in 2008, beginning the year at $7.48 per Mcf, increasing to approximately $13.60 per Mcf in mid 2008, and then ending 2008 at slightly under $6.00 per Mcf. See the charts below for further information on the fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices during 2008. In spite of the commodity price volatility, our average revenue per BOE for the year was $79.42, approximately 34% higher than 2007s average of $59.17 per BOE. These higher prices were a significant contributor to our record cash flow and earnings. Our 2008 cash flow from operations was $774.5 million, a 36% increase over our 2007 annual cash flow from operations of $570.2 million, and our 2008 net income of $388.4 million was 53% higher than our $253.1 million of net income during 2007. In addition to higher commodity prices during 2008, we had record high production levels, partially offset by higher operating costs and a $30.6 million charge related to the cancellation of the Conroe Field acquisition in early October (see also Capital Resources and Liquidity below). During 2008, we also had two significant non cash operational items, (i) a net gain of $257.6 million ($159.7 million net of tax) associated with our fair value adjustments on our derivative contracts, the majority of which were related to the 2009 oil price collars acquired in October 2008, and (ii) a full cost ceiling write down at December 31, 2008, of $226.0 million ($140.1 million net of tax) incurred because of the significant decrease in oil and natural gas prices during the latter part of 2008. 32 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations During 2008 our oil and natural gas production averaged 46,343 BOE/d, an 18% increase over our 2007 average production (after adjusting for the sale of our Louisiana natural gas properties in December 2007 and February 2008), with growth primarily from our tertiary oil operations and Barnett Shale, partially offset by modest declines in our East Mississippi non tertiary production. Our average tertiary oil production increased to 19,377 BOE/d in 2008, a 31% increase over our 2007 tertiary oil production levels, and our average Barnett Shale production increased to 12,699 BOE/d, a 33% increase year over year. (See Results of Operations Operating Results Production for more information). Our oil and natural gas revenues increased 41% in 2008, with 5% of the increase associated with the higher production levels and 36% of the increase due to higher oil and natural gas commodity prices. Our operating costs have gradually increased over the last few years along with commodity prices; the cost inflation caused by a corresponding increase in the demand for goods and services in our business as a result of commodity price escalation. While we recognized some cost savings during the last quarter of 2008 following the sharp decline in commodity prices during the second half of the year, operating costs have not decreased at the same rate as commodity prices. Therefore on average, virtually all of our expenses increased on both an absolute and per BOE basis during 2008. This continued a trend that we have experienced over the last several years as our costs have been increasing, due to (i) higher overall industry costs, (ii) a higher percentage of operations related to tertiary operations (which have higher operating costs per BOE), and (iii) higher compensation expense resulting from additional employees and increased salaries, which we consider necessary in order to remain competitive in the industry. We expect to see further cost reductions in 2009, as we believe that lower spending levels in the industry will reduce demand for goods and services and eventually lower costs, but it is uncertain how quickly costs will come down and by how much. We invested approximately $1.1 billion in capital projects and minor acquisitions during 2008, of which approximately $462.9 million was spent on CO2 pipelines, facilities and drilling. During 2008 our proved oil and natural gas reserves increased from 194.7 MMBOE as of December 31, 2007 to 250.5 MMBOE at December 31, 2008, replacing approximately 525% of our 2008 production, almost entirely from organic growth. The most significant reserve additions during 2008 were approximately 63.4 MMBbls added in our tertiary oil operations, primarily associated with the booking of proved tertiary reserves at Tinsley, Heidelberg and Lockhart Crossing Fields, and 19.5 MMBOE added in our Barnett Shale operations. Genesis Transactions. On May 30, 2008, we closed two transactions with Genesis Energy, L.P. (Genesis) involving our Northeast Jackson Dome (NEJD) and Free State CO2 Pipelines, which included a long term transportation service arrangement for the Free State Pipeline and a 20 year financing lease for the NEJD system. We received from Genesis $225 million in cash and $25 million of Genesis common units (1,199,041 units at an average price of $20.85 per unit). These transactions were treated as financing leases for accounting purposes, with the assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet. We currently project that we will initially pay Genesis approximately $30 million per annum under the financing lease and transportation services agreement, with future payments for the NEJD pipeline fixed at $20.7 million per year during the term of the financing lease, and the payments relating to the Free State Pipeline dependent on the volumes of CO2 transported therein, with a minimum annual payment thereon of $1.2 million. Change in Tax Accounting Method for Certain Tertiary Costs. During the third quarter of 2008, we obtained approval from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to change our method of tax accounting for certain assets used in our tertiary oilfield recovery operations. Previously, we had capitalized and depreciated these costs, but now we can deduct these costs once the assets are placed into service. As a result, we expect to receive tax refunds of approximately $10.6 million for tax years through 2007, along with other tax benefits, and we have reduced our current income tax expense and increased our deferred income tax expense in 2008 to adjust for the impact of this change. This change is not expected to have a significant impact on our overall tax rate; however, it will allow for a quicker deduction of costs for tax purposes. This change in tax treatment impacts the overall economics of certain financing type transactions we have historically utilized, primarily equipment lease financing and certain transactions with Genesis. Following the favorable ruling, we initially discontinued our leasing program and pipeline financings with Genesis, but with the recent downturn in commodity prices, we anticipate that our cash income taxes for 2009 will be minimal, minimizing the effect of this change in tax accounting. With lower projected cash income taxes expected for the near future, and given the generally advantageous interest rate inherent in equipment lease transactions, and their being an alternative source of liquidity, we plan to resume our equipment leasing program in 2009 and budgeted 33 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations $100 million of leasing in 2009, but if possible, we would like to lease as much as $150 million. Because of the uncertainties that exist in the capital markets, we cannot be certain of the dollar amount, pricing or availability of such equipment financing leases. The economic impact of our acceleration of tax deductions will also affect how we view future asset transactions with Genesis. Transactions which are not sales for tax purposes, such as the $175 million financing lease on the NEJD CO2 Pipeline (see Overview Genesis Transactions above) would not be affected provided that they meet other necessary tax criteria. Those transactions which constitute a sale for tax purposes, such as the $75 million sale and associated long term transportation service agreement entered into with Genesis on our Free State CO2 Pipeline (see Overview Genesis Transactions above), will be less advantageous from a tax perspective. Sale of Louisiana Natural Gas Assets. In February 2008, we received the $48.9 million remaining portion (30%) of the proceeds from the sale of our Louisiana natural gas assets, the prior 70% of which closed in December 2007. Production attributable to the sold properties averaged 302 BOE/d (approximately 81% natural gas) during the first quarter of 2008, representing production prior to the closing date for the portion of the sale that closed in February. Recent 2009 Transactions Purchase of Hastings Field. On February 2, 2009, we closed the $201 million acquisition of the Hastings Field, which is located near Houston, Texas, and is a potential tertiary oil field to be supplied by the Green CO2 Pipeline which has commenced construction. In August 2008, we exercised our option with a subsidiary of Venoco, Inc. (Venoco) to purchase Hastings Field, and in consideration of our exercising the option in 2008 rather than 2009, Venoco agreed to extend the deadlines for capital expenditures, commencement of CO2 injections and certain other contractual requirements by one year. Management Succession Plan. On February 5, 2009, our Board of Directors adopted a management succession plan under which our current executive officers will assume new roles on or about June 30, 2009. Gareth Roberts, the Companys founder, will relinquish his position as President and CEO and become Co Chairman of the Board of Directors and will assume a non officer role as the Companys Chief Strategist. Phil Rykhoek, currently Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will become CEO; Tracy Evans, currently Senior Vice President Reservoir Engineering, will become President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Allen, currently Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, will become Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Subordinated Debt Issuance. On February 13, 2009, we issued $420 million of 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the Notes). The Notes were sold to the public at 92.816% of par, plus accrued interest from February 13, 2009, which equates to an effective yield to maturity of approximately 11.25% (before offering expenses). Interest on the Notes will be paid on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning September 1, 2009. The Notes will mature on March 1, 2016. We used the net proceeds from the offering of approximately $381 million to repay most of the then outstanding debt on our bank credit facility. Capital Resources and Liquidity During the last six months, we have taken several steps to improve our liquidity as a result of the deterioration in the capital markets and the decrease in oil and natural gas commodity prices. These included a $400 million increase to our bank commitment amount (see Increased Bank Credit Line below for more details), cancellation of the $600 million acquisition of Conroe Field, purchase of oil derivative contracts covering approximately 80% of our currently estimated 2009 oil production, and reduction of our capital budget for 2009. Also, in February 2009, we issued $420 million of Senior Subordinated Notes (see Overview Recent 2009 Transactions Subordinated Debt Issuance). Prior to the decline in economic conditions, we had intended, in a tax free exchange, to exchange the Barnett Shale properties for the Conroe and Hastings Fields, both of which are future tertiary flood candidates located near Houston, Texas. However, because of the deterioration in capital market conditions, we believed that the sale of our Barnett Shale properties at a price that we would consider reasonable was doubtful, and without the certainty of a Barnett Shale property sale, we did not feel comfortable increasing our leverage. As such, we cancelled our $600 million contract to purchase Conroe Field, forfeiting a $30 million non refundable deposit which we expensed in the third quarter. To further protect our liquidity in the event that commodity prices continued to decline, in October 34 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 2008 we purchased oil derivative contracts for 2009 with a floor price of $75 / Bbl and a ceiling price of $115 / Bbl for total consideration of $15.5 million. The collars cover 30,000 Bbls/d representing approximately 80% of our currently anticipated 2009 oil production. See Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Contracts below in this section for information regarding the counterparties for these collars. We further significantly increased our liquidity in February 2009 by issuing $420 million of subordinated debt. We used net proceeds from that offering ($381 million) to repay most of our then outstanding bank debt, freeing up most of our bank credit line for future capital needs, as our total bank commitment amount of $750 million was not reduced because of the offering. We currently estimate that our 2009 total capital spending will be approximately $750 million, plus the already closed Hastings acquisition of $201 million. Our current 2009 capital budget includes approximately $485 million relating to our CO2 pipelines, the majority of which is to build the Green CO2 Pipeline. The budget also assumes that we fund approximately $100 million of budgeted equipment purchases with operating leases, a practice we had discontinued in the last half of 2008 as a result of our favorable tax ruling (see Overview Change in Tax Accounting Method for Certain Tertiary Costs). Use of these operating leases is dependent upon being able to secure acceptable financing and as of February 27, 2009, we had not yet secured most of this financing. The 2009 budget incorporates significantly reduced spending in the Barnett Shale and in other conventional areas such as the Heidelberg Selma Chalk, and a slower development program for our tertiary operations. Based on our current cash flow projections, using $50.00 per barrel for oil and $5.00 per Mcf for natural gas prices and including our expected oil derivative contract settlements, we anticipate that our capital expenditures could exceed projected cash flow by $400 million to $500 million, including the Hastings acquisition. We anticipate funding this shortfall during 2009 with the proceeds from our February 2009 subordinated debt issuance and our bank credit line, and expect to have a total bank debt balance by the end of 2009 of $150 million to $250 million, leaving us $500 million to $600 million of availability on our $750 million bank commitment amount. We anticipate that this credit line will be sufficient to fund our 2009 plans and do not expect our bank credit line to be reduced by our banks unless commodity prices were to further decrease significantly from current levels. We may raise additional capital during 2009 if it is possible to do so in a reasonably economic manner. Such additional capital sources could include the sale or joint venture of assets, a volumetric production payment, additional operating leases, or other options that become available during the year. We will also continually monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis, adjusting them up or down depending on commodity prices and the resultant cash flow. Therefore, should our cash flow be less than expected, we would plan to reduce our capital expenditures to the extent possible during the year, which could in turn, have the impact of reducing our anticipated production levels in future years. For 2009, we have contracted for certain capital expenditures, including construction of most of the Green Pipeline already in progress and two drilling rigs, and therefore the portion of capital that we could eliminate without significant penalty is limited (see also Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Commitments and Obligations). Based on our long term models, we expect our future capital spending needs to be less in the future than they have been in recent years, excluding any potential acquisitions. Therefore, if commodity prices remain at current levels after 2009, we anticipate that we will be able to match our capital spending with our projected cash flow from operations and preserve our liquidity to the extent that we deem necessary, although any such spending reductions would most likely lower our anticipated rate of production growth. Increased Bank Credit Line. In early October 2008, we amended our bank credit facility, which increased the banks commitment amount from $350 million to $750 million, maintained our borrowing base at $1.0 billion, modified the commitment fees and pricing grid for the loan, raising the pricing grid by 25 basis points, and provided for other transactions, such as the acquisition of Conroe Field, which were not consummated. The borrowing base represents the amount that can be borrowed from a credit standpoint while the commitment amount is the amount the banks have committed to fund pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement. We further amended our bank credit facility in February 2009 to allow us to issue the subordinated debt at an interest rate higher than the previously allowed 10% (see Overview Recent 2009 Transactions Subordinated Debt Issuance). While bank borrowing bases in our industry are likely to be reduced in the future to reflect the reduction in commodity prices, with $250 million of cushion between our borrowing base and commitment amount and the incremental value added by retaining our Barnett Shale properties, currently we do not expect our bank commitment level to be reduced below $750 million unless prices were to further decrease significantly from current strip prices of approximately $45.00 per barrel for oil and $5.00 per Mcf for natural gas. As of February 27, 2009, we had 35 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations outstanding $525 million (principal amount) of 7.5% subordinated notes, $420 million (principal amount) of 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes and $60 million of bank debt. Although we remain interested in acquiring mature oil fields that we believe have potential as future tertiary flood candidates, with the general lack of liquidity in the capital markets, our ability to fund any significant acquisitions will be limited and are not likely to be material unless we are able to obtain additional capital.

Our 2007 capital expenditures were funded with $570.2 million of cash flow from operations, $150.0 million from the April 2007 issuance of subordinated debt, $135.8 million from property sales proceeds, and $16.0 million of net bank borrowings. Our 2006 expenditures were funded with $461.8 million of cash flow from operations, $139.8 million of equity issued, $134.0 million of net bank borrowings, and a $13.2 million increase in our accrued capital expenditures, with the balance funded with working capital, predominately cash from the December 2005 issuance of $150 million of subordinated debt. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Commitments and Obligations At December 31, 2008, our dollar denominated payment obligations that are not on our balance sheet include our operating leases, which at year end 2008 totaled $128.6 million (including $104.5 million of equipment costs) relating primarily to the lease financing of certain equipment for CO2 recycling facilities at our tertiary oil fields. We also have several leases relating to office space and other minor equipment leases. At December 31, 2008, we had a total of $10.5 million of letters of credit outstanding under our bank credit agreement. Additionally, we have dollar denominated obligations that are not currently recorded on our balance sheet relating to various obligations for development and exploratory expenditures that arise from our normal capital expenditure program or from other transactions common to our industry. In addition, in order to recover our undeveloped proved reserves, we must also fund the associated future development costs forecasted in our proved reserve reports. For a further discussion of our future development costs and proved reserves, see Results of Operations Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization below. Genesis Energy, LLC, our subsidiary that is the general partner of Genesis (a limited partnership), could under certain circumstances become liable, in its capacity as general partner, for debts and obligations of Genesis. There were no guarantees by Denbury or any of its other subsidiaries of the debt of Genesis or of Genesis Energy, LLC at December 31, 2008. 36 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations During the second quarter of 2008, we entered into transactions with Genesis relating to two of our CO2 pipelines (see Overview Genesis Transactions above). As a result of these two transactions, we currently project that we will initially pay Genesis approximately $30 million per annum under the financing lease and transportation services agreement (a pro rated total of $15.4 million during 2008), with future payments for the NEJD pipeline fixed at $20.7 million per year during the term of the financing lease, and the payments relating to the Free State Pipeline dependent on the volumes of CO2 transported therein, with a minimum annual payment thereon of $1.2 million. We currently have long term commitments to purchase CO2 from four proposed gasification plants, two of which are in the Gulf Coast region and two in the Midwest region (Illinois / Kentucky area) of the United States. The Midwest plants are not only conditioned on those specific plants being constructed, but also upon Denbury contracting additional volumes of CO2 for purchase in the general area of the proposed plants that would provide an acceptable economic return on the CO2 pipeline that we would need to construct to transport these volumes to our existing CO2 pipeline system. If all four plants are built, these CO2 sources are currently anticipated to provide us with aggregate CO2 volumes of around 1 Bcf/d. Due to the current economic conditions, the earliest we would expect any plant to be completed and provide CO2 would be 2013, and there is some doubt as to whether they will be constructed at all. The base price of CO2 per Mcf from these CO2 sources varies by plant and location, but is generally higher than our most recent all in cost of CO2 from our natural sources (Jackson Dome) using current oil prices. Prices for CO2 delivered from these projects are expected to be competitive with the cost of our natural CO2 after adjusting for our share of potential carbon emissions reduction credits using estimated futures prices of carbon emissions reduction credits. If all four plants are built, the aggregate purchase obligation for this CO2 would be around $135 million per year, assuming a $50 per barrel oil price, before any potential savings from our share of carbon emissions reduction credits. All of the contracts have price adjustments that fluctuate based on the price of oil. Construction has not yet commenced on any of these plants, and their construction is contingent on the satisfactory resolution of various issues, including financing. While it is likely that not every plant currently under contract will be constructed, there are several other plants under consideration that could provide CO2 to us that would either supplement or replace the CO2 volumes from the four proposed plants that we currently have contracts with. We are having ongoing discussions and negotiations with several of these other potential sources. We have not included any financial commitment attributable to the existing contracts or other potential sources in the commitment table below as all such payments are contingent on the plants being built. A summary of our obligations at December 31, 2008, is presented in the following table: Payments Due by Period Amounts in thousands Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Subordinated debt (a) $ 525,000 $ $ $ $ $ 225,000 $ 300,000 Senior Bank Loan (a) 75,000 75,000 Estimated interest payments on subordinated debt and Senior Bank Loan (a) 234,096 41,588 41,588 40,933 39,375 26,661 43,951 Pipeline financing lease obligations (b) 588,414 29,358 31,759 33,205 33,438 33,518 427,136 Operating lease obligations 128,606 17,938 17,351 16,571 15,199 12,510 49,037 Capital lease obligations (c) 9,219 2,120 1,882 1,882 1,242 700 1,393 Capital expenditure obligations (d) 376,827 367,980 8,847 Other Cash Commitments: Future development costs on proved oil and gas reserves, net of capital obligations (e) 890,262 97,048 312,069 188,275 115,605 61,921 115,344 Future development cost on proved CO2 reserves, net of capital obligations (f) 116,792 18,792 22,000 76,000 Asset retirement obligations (g) 106,413 2,154 1,321 1,288 722 1,013 99,915 Total $ 3,050,629 $ 576,978 $ 414,817 $ 379,154 $ 205,581 $ 361,323 $ 1,112,776 (a) These long term borrowings and related interest payments are further discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This table assumes that our long term debt is held until maturity. On February 13, 2009 we issued $420 million of 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes at a discount, 92.816% of par, for which the obligations related thereto are not included in the above table. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 37 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (b) Represents estimated future cash payments under a long term transportation service agreement for the Free State Pipeline, and future minimum cash payments in a 20 year financing lease for the NEJD pipeline system. Both transactions with Genesis were entered into in 2008 and are being accounted for as financing leases. The payment required for the Free State Pipeline is variable based upon the amount of the CO2 we ship through the pipeline and the commitment amounts disclosed above for that line are computed based upon our internal forecasts. Approximately $338.2 million of these payments represent interest. See Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements. (c) Represents future minimum cash commitments of $5.9 million to Genesis under capital leases in place at December 31, 2008, primarily for transportation of crude oil and CO2, and $3.3 million for office space and rental equipment. Approximately $2.0 million of these payments represents interest. (d) Represents future cash commitments under contracts in place as of December 31, 2008, primarily for pipe, pipeline construction contracts, drilling rig services and well related costs, including approximately $311.2 million for our Green CO2 Pipeline. As is common in our industry, we commit to make certain expenditures on a regular basis as part of our ongoing development and exploration program. These commitments generally relate to projects that occur during the subsequent several months and are usually part of our normal operating expenses or part of our capital budget, which for 2009 is currently set at $750 million, exclusive of acquisitions. In certain cases we have the ability to terminate contracts for equipment in which case we would only be liable for the cost incurred by the vendor up to that point; however, as we currently do not anticipate cancelling those contracts these amounts include our estimated payments under those contracts. We also have recurring expenditures for such things as accounting, engineering and legal fees, software maintenance, subscriptions, and other overhead type items. Normally these expenditures do not change materially on an aggregate basis from year to year and are part of our general and administrative expenses. We have not attempted to estimate the amounts of these types of recurring expenditures in this table as most could be quickly cancelled with regard to any specific vendor, even though the expense itself may be required for ongoing normal operations of the Company. (e) Represents projected capital costs as scheduled in our December 31, 2008 proved reserve report that are necessary in order to recover our proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves. These are not contractual commitments and are net of any other capital obligations shown under Contractual Obligations in the table above. (f) Represents projected capital costs as scheduled in our December 31, 2008 proved reserve report that are necessary in order to recover our proved undeveloped CO2 reserves from our CO2 source wells used to produce CO2 for our tertiary operations. These are not contractual commitments and are net of any other capital obligations shown above. (g) Represents the estimated future asset retirement obligations on an undiscounted basis. The present discounted asset retirement obligation is $45.1 million, as determined under SFAS No. 143, and is further discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During February 2009, we closed our $201 million purchase of Hastings Field (see Recent 2009 Transactions Purchase of Hastings Field above). Under the agreement, we are required to make aggregate net capital expenditures in this field of approximately $179 million over the next six years as follows (the following amounts representing cumulative amounts required by that date): $26.8 million by December 31, 2010, $71.5 million by December 31, 2011, $107.2 million by December 31, 2012, $142.9 million by December 31, 2013, and $178.7 million by December 31, 2014. If we fail to spend the required amounts by the due dates, we are required to make a cash payment equal to 10% of the cumulative shortfall at each applicable date. Further, we are committed to injecting at least an average of 50 MMcf/day of CO2 (total of purchased and recycled) in the West Hastings Unit for the 90 day period prior to January 1, 2013. If such injections do not occur, we must either (1) relinquish our rights to initiate (or continue) tertiary operations and reassign to Venoco all assets previously purchased for the value of such assets at that time based upon the discounted value of the fields proved reserves using a 20% discount rate, or (2) make an additional payment of $20 million in January 2013, less any payments made for failure to meet the capital spending requirements as of December 31, 2012, and a $30 million payment for each subsequent year (less amounts paid for capital expenditure shortfalls) until the CO2 injection in the Hastings Field equals or exceeds the minimum required injection rate. Long term contracts require us to deliver CO2 to our industrial CO2 customers at various contracted prices, plus we have a CO2 delivery obligation to Genesis pursuant to three volumetric production payments (VPP) entered into during 2003 through 2005. Based upon the maximum amounts deliverable as stated in the industrial contracts and the volumetric production payments, we estimate that we may be obligated to deliver up to 512 Bcf of CO2 on a cumulative basis to these customers over the next 19 years; however, since the group as a whole has historically taken less CO2 than the maximum allowed in their contracts, based on the current level of deliveries, we project that our commitment would likely be reduced to approximately 254 Bcf. The maximum volume required in any given year is approximately 136 MMcf/d, although based on our current level of deliveries this would likely be reduced to approximately 78 MMcf/d. Given the size of our proven CO2 reserves at December 31, 2008 (approximately 5.6 Tcf before deducting approximately 153.8 Bcf for the three VPPs), our current production capabilities and our projected levels of CO2 usage for our own tertiary flooding program, we believe that we will be able to meet these delivery obligations. 38 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations CO2 Operations Overview. Since we acquired our first carbon dioxide tertiary flood in Mississippi in 1999, we have gradually increased our emphasis on these types of operations. During this time, we have learned a considerable amount about tertiary operations and working with carbon dioxide. Our tertiary operations have grown to the point that approximately 50% of our December 31, 2008 proved reserves are proved tertiary oil reserves, almost 50% of our forecasted 2009 production is expected to come from tertiary oil operations (on a BOE basis), and almost all of our 2009 capital expenditures are related to our current or future tertiary operations. We particularly like this play as (i) it has a lower risk and is more predictable than most traditional exploration and development activities, (ii) it provides a reasonable rate of return at relatively low oil prices (we estimate our economic break even per barrel dollar cost on these projects at current oil prices is in the range of the mid twenties, depending on the specific field and area), and (iii) we have virtually no competition for this type of activity in our geographic area. Generally, from East Texas to Florida, there are no known significant natural sources of CO2 except our own, and these large volumes of CO2 that we own drive the play. In addition, we are pursuing anthropogenic (man made) sources of CO2 to use in our tertiary operations, which we believe will not only help us recover additional oil, but will provide an economical way to sequester CO2. We have acquired several old oil fields in our areas of operations with potential for tertiary recovery and plan to acquire additional fields, and we are continuing to expand our CO2 pipeline infrastructure to transport CO2. We talk about our tertiary operations by labeling operating areas or groups of fields as phases. Phase I is in Southwest Mississippi and includes several fields along our 183 mile NEJD CO2 Pipeline that we acquired in 2001. The most significant fields in this area are Little Creek, Mallalieu, McComb and Brookhaven. Phase II, which began with the early 2006 completion of the Free State CO2 Pipeline to East Mississippi, includes Eucutta, Soso, Martinville and Heidelberg Fields. Tinsley Field located northwest of Jackson, Mississippi, acquired in January 2006, is our Phase III and is serviced by that portion of the Delta CO2 Pipeline completed in January 2008. Phase IV includes Cranfield and Lake St. John Fields, two fields near the Mississippi/Louisiana border located west of the Phase I fields, and Phase V is Delhi Field, a Louisiana field we acquired in 2006, located southwest of Tinsley Field. Flooding in Phase V is anticipated to begin in 2009 upon completion of the Delta CO2 Pipeline from Tinsley to Delhi. Citronelle Field in Southwest Alabama, another field acquired in 2006, is our Phase VI which will require an extension to the Free State CO2 Pipeline, the timing of which is uncertain at this time. Our last two currently existing phases will require completion of our proposed Green Pipeline, a 320 mile CO2 pipeline which will run from Southern Louisiana to near Houston, Texas, and is scheduled for completion in 2010. Hastings Field, a field which we purchased in February 2009 (see Commitments and Contingencies), is our Phase VII, and the Seabreeze Complex, acquired in 2007, will be our Phase VIII. CO2 Resources. Since we acquired the CO2 source field located near Jackson, Mississippi, in 2001, we have continued to develop the field and have increased the proven CO2 reserves from approximately 800 Bcf at the time of the acquisition to approximately 5.6 Tcf as of December 31, 2008. During 2008, the increase in our proven CO2 reserves was offset by the 233 Bcf of CO2 production during the year. The estimate of 5.6 Tcf of proved CO2 reserves is based on 100% ownership of the CO2 reserves, of which Denburys net revenue interest ownership is approximately 4.5 Tcf. Both reserve estimates are included in the evaluation of proven CO2 reserves prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton. In discussing the available CO2 reserves, we make reference to the gross amount of proved reserves, as this is the amount that is available for Denburys tertiary recovery programs, Genesis, and industrial users, as Denbury is responsible for distributing the entire CO2 production stream for all of these uses. We currently estimate that it will take approximately 1.8 Tcf of CO2 to develop and produce the proved tertiary recovery reserves we have recorded at December 31, 2008, in Phases I, II and III. Today, we own every known producing CO2 well in the region, providing us a significant strategic advantage in the acquisition of other properties in Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas that could be further exploited through tertiary recovery. As of February 27, 2009, we estimate that we are capable of producing between 900 MMcf/d and 1 Bcf/d of CO2, over eight times the rate that we were capable of producing at the time of our initial acquisition in 2001. We continue to drill additional CO2 wells, with one more well planned for 2009, in order to further increase our production capacity. Our drilling activity at Jackson Dome will continue beyond 2009 as our current forecasts for the existing eight phases suggest that we will need approximately 1.4 Bcf/d of CO2 production by 2013. 39 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In addition to using CO2 for our tertiary operations, we sell CO2 to third party industrial users under long term contracts. Most of these industrial contracts have been sold to Genesis along with the sale of volumetric production payments for the CO2. Our average daily CO2 production during 2006, 2007 and 2008 was approximately 342 MMcf/d, 493 MMcf/d and 637 MMcf/d, respectively, of which approximately 75% in 2006, 81% in 2007 and 86% in 2008 was used in our tertiary recovery operations, with the balance delivered to Genesis under the volumetric production payments or sold to third party industrial users. We spent approximately $0.22 per Mcf in operating expenses to produce our CO2 during 2008, more than our 2007 average of $0.21 per Mcf and our 2006 average of $0.19 per Mcf, with the higher costs each year primarily due to higher average oil costs, which is the basis upon which we pay royalty owners for the CO2, and higher operating costs. Our CO2 costs peaked at $0.27 per Mcf in the second quarter of 2008, corresponding to the peak in oil prices, but decreased during the fourth quarter of 2008 to an average of approximately $0.15 per Mcf as a result of the decline in oil prices. Our estimated total cost per thousand cubic feet of CO2 during 2008 was approximately $0.30, after inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense related to the CO2 production, as compared to approximately $0.29 per Mcf during 2007 and $0.28 per Mcf during 2006. Man Made CO2 Sources. In addition to our natural source of CO2, we are in discussions with the owners of several proposed solid carbon gasification plants which, if constructed, will convert coal or petroleum coke into various other products, with CO2 being a significant by product of the process. If built, these plants could provide us with significant additional sources of CO2 in the future which would enable us to further expand our tertiary operations, although the earliest date this CO2 is expected to be available to us is in 2013. These plants have all been delayed due to current economic conditions and it is uncertain, when, if ever, these plants will be built. We have entered into long term commitments to purchase CO2 from four proposed plants (see Commitments and Obligations), which, if all four plants are built, are currently anticipated to provide us with an aggregate of approximately 1 Bcf/d of CO2. In addition to the proposed gasification plants, we have ongoing discussions with existing plants of various types that emit CO2 and we may be able to purchase their volumes. In order to capture such volumes, we (or the plant owner) would need to install additional equipment, which include at a minimum, compression and dehydration facilities. Most of these existing plants emit relatively small volumes of CO2, generally less than the proposed gasification plants, but such volumes may still be attractive if the source is located near our Green CO2 Pipeline. The capture of CO2 could also be influenced by anticipated federal legislation, which could impose economic penalties for the emission of CO2. We believe that we are a likely purchaser of CO2 produced in our area of operations because of the scale of our tertiary operations, our CO2 pipeline infrastructure, and the large natural source of CO2 (Jackson Dome), which can act as a swing CO2 source to balance CO2 supplies and demands. Overview of Tertiary Economics. When we began our tertiary operations several years ago, they were generally economic at oil prices below $20 per Bbl, although the economics varied by field. Our costs have escalated during the last few years due to general cost inflation in the industry, but we expect them to be reduced during 2009, and to be at economic break even dollar costs in the mid twenties per barrel if oil prices remain at their current reduced level, dependent on the specific field. Our inception to date finding and development costs (including future development and abandonment costs but excluding expenditures on fields without proven reserves) for our tertiary oil fields through December 31, 2008, are approximately $11.30 per BOE. Currently, we forecast that most of these costs will average less than $10 per BOE over the life of each field, depending on the state of a particular field at the time we begin operations, the amount of potential oil, the proximity to a pipeline or other facilities, and other factors, as the finding and development costs to date do not include significant unproven potential reserves in most of the fields. Our operating costs for tertiary operations are highly dependent on commodity prices and could range from $15 to $25 per BOE over the life of each field, again depending on the field itself. While these economic factors have wide ranges, our rate of return from these operations has generally been better than our rate of return on traditional oil and gas operations, and thus our tertiary operations have become our single most important focus area. While it is extremely difficult to accurately forecast future production, we do believe that our tertiary recovery operations provide significant long term production growth potential at reasonable rates of return, with relatively low risk, and thus will be the backbone of our Companys growth for the foreseeable future. Although we believe that our plans and projections are reasonable and achievable, there could be delays or unforeseen problems in the future that could delay or affect the economics of our overall tertiary development program. We believe that such delays or price effects, if any, should only be temporary. 40 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Statement Impact of CO2 Operations. Our increasing emphasis on CO2 tertiary recovery projects has significantly impacted, and will continue to impact our financial results and certain operating statistics. First, there is a significant delay between the initial capital expenditures on these fields and the resulting production increases, as we must build facilities before CO2 flooding can commence, and it usually takes six to 12 months before the field responds to the injection of CO2 (i.e., oil production commences). Further, we may spend significant amounts of capital before we can recognize any proven reserves from fields we flood (see Analysis of CO2 Tertiary Recovery Operating Activities below). Even after a field has proven reserves, there will usually be significant amounts of additional capital required to fully develop the field. Second, these tertiary projects can be more expensive to operate than our other oil fields because of the cost of injecting and recycling the CO2 (primarily due to the significant energy requirements to re compress the CO2 back into a near liquid state for re injection purposes). Since a significant portion of our operating costs vary along with commodity and electrical prices, these costs are highly variable and will increase in a high commodity price environment and decrease in a low price environment. As an example (as discussed above), during 2008, the cost of our CO2 varied from $0.15 per Mcf to $0.27 per Mcf. Most of our CO2 operating costs are allocated to our tertiary oil fields and recorded as lease operating expenses or capitalized to those fields at the time the CO2 is injected, and these costs have historically represented over 25% of the total operating costs for a tertiary operation. Since we expense all of the operating costs to produce and inject our CO2 (following the commencement of tertiary oil production), the operating costs per barrel will be higher at the inception of CO2 injection projects because of minimal related oil production at that time. Analysis of CO2 Tertiary Recovery Operating Activities. We currently have tertiary operations ongoing at almost all Phase I fields, at Soso, Martinville, Eucutta and Heidelberg Fields in Phase II, Tinsley Field in Phase III, and Cranfield (Phase IV). We project that our oil production from our CO2 operations will increase substantially over the next several years as we continue to expand this program by adding additional projects and phases. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 125.8 MMBbls of proven oil reserves related to tertiary operations (50.0 MMBbls in Phase I, 41.4 MMBbls in Phase II and 34.4 MMBbls in Phase III) representing about 50% of our total corporate proved reserves, and have identified and estimate significant additional oil potential in other fields that we own in this region. We added 63.4 MMBbls of tertiary related proved oil reserves during 2008, primarily initial proven tertiary oil reserves at Heidelberg Field (Phase II), Tinsley Field (Phase III) and Lockhart Crossing Field (Phase I). In order to recognize proved tertiary oil reserves, we must either have an oil production response to the CO2 injections or the field must be analogous to an existing tertiary flood. The magnitude of proven reserves that we can book in any given year will depend on our progress with new floods and the timing of the production response. Our average annual oil production from our CO2 tertiary recovery activities has increased during the last few years, from 3,970 Bbls/d in 2002 to 19,377 Bbls/d during 2008 (21,874 Bbls/d during the fourth quarter of 2008). Tertiary oil production represented approximately 62% of our total corporate oil production during 2008 and approximately 42% of our total corporate production of both oil and natural gas during the same period on a BOE basis. We expect that this tertiary related oil production will continue to increase, although the increases are not always predictable or consistent. While we may have temporary fluctuation in oil production related to tertiary operations, this usually does not indicate any issue with the proved and potential oil reserves recoverable with CO2, because the historical correlation between oil production and CO2 injections remains high. A detailed discussion of each of our tertiary oil fields and the development of each is included on pages 8 11 under Our Tertiary Oil Fields With Proved Tertiary Reserves. Following is a chart with our tertiary oil production by field for 2006 and 2007, and by quarter for 2008. In 2008, we had initial production response from our tertiary floods at Lockhart Crossing Field and Tinsley Field, and we saw continued improved response from our newer Phase II floods at Martinville, Eucutta and Soso Fields, most of which were initiated during 2006. We initiated CO2 injections at Cranfield Field in July 2008 and at Heidelberg Field in December 2008. We anticipate our first response and sales from the Cranfield CO2 injections in the first quarter of 2009 and from the Heidelberg Field injections in the second half of 2009. One of our Phase I fields, Little Creek, is a mature flood and is expected to continue its gradual decline over the next several years. Production at another Phase I field, Mallalieu, appears to have plateaued and is not expected to increase during 2009. 41 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

We also lease a portion of our recycling and plant equipment used in our tertiary operations, which further increases operating expenses. Over the last six years we have leased certain equipment that qualifies for operating lease treatment representing an underlying aggregate cost of approximately $104.5 million as of December 31, 2008. These leases have been an attractive method of financing due to their low imputed interest rates, which are fixed for seven to ten years. Also, the cost to produce our CO2 gradually increased through mid 2008, as oil prices increased (see CO2 Resources above), with all of these items causing our lease operating expense for our tertiary operations to peak at $26.81 per Bbl in the third quarter of 2008, before declining along with the drop in oil prices in the latter part of 2008 to an average of $21.86 per Bbl during the fourth quarter of 2008. Our total tertiary operating expenses and cost per barrel for each of the last three years are set forth in the following table: Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Tertiary operating expenses (thousands) $ 167,156 $ 106,541 $ 65,028 Tertiary operating expenses per Bbl 23.57 19.77 17.69 Through December 31, 2008, we have invested a total of $1.4 billion in tertiary fields (including allocated acquisition costs) and have only $105.3 million in unrecovered net cash flow (revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures). Of this total invested amount, approximately $229.6 million (17%) was spent on fields which had little or no proved reserves at December 31, 2008 (i.e., fields for which significant incremental proved reserves are anticipated during 2009 and beyond). The proved oil reserves in our CO2 fields have a PV 10 Value of $1.0 billion, using December 31, 2008, constant NYMEX pricing of $44.60 per Bbl. These amounts do not include the capital costs or related depreciation and amortization of our CO2 producing properties, but do include CO2 source field lease operating costs and transportation costs. CO2 Source Field Related Capital Budget for 2009. Tentatively, we plan to spend approximately $52 million in 2009 in the Jackson Dome area with the intent to add deliverability for future operations. Approximately $138 million in capital expenditures is budgeted in 2009 at the oil field level in Phases I through V, plus an additional $485 million for our Delta and Green CO2 Pipelines, making our combined CO2 related expenditures just over 90% of our $750 million 2009 capital budget (excluding the Hastings Field purchase). 42 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Operating Results Net income and cash flow from operations have increased each year during the last three years.

The production increases in 2008 were primarily from increased oil production from our tertiary operations and increased production from the Barnett Shale, partially reduced by declines in production from our Mississippi non CO2 floods. Production increases from the Barnett Shale contributed approximately 3,149 BOE/d of the increase and our tertiary operations contributed 4,610 BOE/d of the increase, partially offset by decreases of 582 BOE/d at our Mississippi non CO2 fields. See CO2 Operations above for a discussion of our tertiary related production. Production in the Mississippi non CO2 floods area decreased slightly each year from the prior year as this area is on a gradual decline from normal depletion, partially offset by drilling activity developing the Selma Chalk natural gas reservoir in the Heidelberg area. Our production in the Barnett Shale area in Texas increased 3,149 BOE/d (33%) during 2008 over our 2007 level, and during 2007 increased 4,690 BOE/d (97%) over our 2006 level there. We drilled and completed 38 wells during 2008, 45 wells during 2007 and 46 wells drilled during 2006, and plan to drill 6 wells during 2009. We have severely curtailed our spending plans in this area for 2009 in an effort to prioritize and reduce our overall capital expenditures. We expect our Barnett Shale production to gradually decrease throughout 2009 based on our reduced level of future drilling activity. These wells are characterized by steep decline rates in their first year of production, followed by a gradual leveling off of production and a resultant slow decline rate, giving them an overall long production life. The Texas property acquisition we made late in the first quarter of 2007, the Seabreeze Complex, contributed approximately 506 BOE/d to our 2008 average production, approximately the same as the 524 BOE/d produced during 2007. The decrease in onshore Louisiana production in 2008 is due to the December 2007 and February 2008 divesture of these assets, excluding any oil fields that could have tertiary oil potential (see Overview Sale of Louisiana Natural Gas Assets). Our production for 2008 was 68% oil as compared to 63% during 2007 and 62% in 2006. This increase is due to the sale of our Louisiana natural gas assets in December 2007 and February 2008, and to the increase in our tertiary oil production. 45 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Oil and Natural Gas Revenues. Our oil and natural gas revenues have increased for each of the last two years due to increases in both overall commodity prices and production, as seen in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Amounts in thousands 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Percentage Percentage Increase in Increase Increase in Increase Revenues in Revenues Revenues in Revenues Change in revenues due to: Increase in production $ 50,845 5 % $ 142,860 20 % Increase in commodity prices 343,377 36 % 93,371 13 % Total increase in revenues $ 394,222 41 % $ 236,231 33 % Excluding any impact of our derivative contracts, our net realized commodity prices and NYMEX differentials were as follows during 2008, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net Realized Prices: Oil price per Bbl $ 92.73 $ 69.80 $ 59.87 Gas price per Mcf 8.56 6.81 7.10 Price per BOE 79.42 59.17 53.37 NYMEX Differentials: Oil per Bbl $ (7.02 ) $ (2.65 ) $ (6.41 ) Natural Gas per Mcf (0.33 ) (0.28 ) 0.13 Our oil NYMEX differential peaked during 2008 in the second quarter at $(9.64), corresponding to the peak in oil prices. Differentials have decreased since that time along with the decline in oil prices, averaging $(3.59) during the fourth quarter of 2008, a relatively low differential based on our historical averages, but not as low as they were during 2007. The improved NYMEX differential during 2007 was related to higher prices received for both our light sweet barrels and our sour barrels primarily as a result of NYMEX (WTI) prices being depressed due to lack of available storage capacity in the mid continent area, an oversupply of crude from Canada, capacity/transportation issues in moving crude oil out of the Cushing, Oklahoma area and unanticipated refinery outages. This trend had reversed itself by the fourth quarter of 2007, with average NYMEX oil differentials during that quarter of $(7.27) per Bbl. Our natural gas NYMEX differentials are generally caused by movement in the NYMEX natural gas prices during a month as most of our natural gas is sold on an index price that is set near the first of the month. While the percentage change in the above table is quite large, these differentials are very seldom more than a dollar above or below the NYMEX amount. 46 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

During 2008 we made cash payments of $57.5 million on the settlements of our commodity derivative contracts, with $26.5 million related to our 2008 natural gas swaps, and $31.0 million related to payments on our oil swaps. During 2007, we had settlements on our commodity derivative contracts of $20.5 million, all related to our natural gas swaps, partially offset by payments on our oil swaps. During 2006, we made payments on our derivative contracts of $5.3 million, related to oil swaps put in place in late 2005 to protect the rate of return on fields acquired in January 2006. Changing commodity prices cause fluctuations in the mark to market value adjustments of our derivative contracts. The most significant adjustment made in 2008 was for oil derivative contracts purchased in October 2008 covering 30,000 Bbls/d during calendar year 2009. These contracts have a floor price of $75 per Bbl and a ceiling price of $115 per Bbl, and were purchased for $15.5 million. As oil prices declined significantly after we purchased these contracts, we recognized $234.3 million of non cash fair value income on these contracts during the fourth quarter of 2008. The estimated fair value of these contracts recognized as a current asset on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008, was $249.7 million. Further, significant fluctuations in oil commodity prices during 2009 may result in corresponding significant fluctuations in our 2009 quarterly pretax income due to market value changes in these outstanding contracts. The remaining $23.3 million of net non cash fair value income during 2008 was primarily associated with our oil swap contracts that settled during 2008. During 2007, we expensed $24.6 million related to mark to market value adjustments of our natural gas swaps, primarily offsetting the gain we recognized on the same swaps in late 2006 as the swaps had expired by the end of 2007. We also expensed $14.5 million related to our oil swaps in 2007, as a result of the increasing oil price. We recognized a non cash gain of $25.1 million in 2006 as a result of decreasing prices, primarily related to the 75 MMcf/d of natural gas swaps for calendar 2007 that we entered into during December 2006. Operating Expenses. Our lease operating expenses have increased each year on both a per BOE basis and in absolute dollars primarily as a result of (i) our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations (see discussion of those expenses under CO2 Operations above), (ii) higher overall industry costs, (iii) increased personnel and related costs, (iv) higher fuel and electrical costs to operate our properties, and (v) increasing lease payments for certain of our tertiary operating facilities and equipment. During 2008, operating costs averaged $18.13 per BOE, up from $14.34 per BOE during 2007, and $12.46 per BOE in 2006. On a sequential quarterly basis during 2008, our operating costs per BOE averaged $16.15, $18.23, $20.20, and finally $17.90 for the fourth quarter, generally following the changes in oil prices. Operating expenses for our tertiary operations were $167.2 million in 2008, up from $106.5 million during 2007, and $65.0 million during 2006, all as a result of increased tertiary activity. Tertiary operating expenses were particularly impacted by higher electrical costs during 2007 and the first half of 2008, higher costs for CO2, and payments on leased facilities and equipment (see CO2 Operations above). As discussed under CO2 Operations, we expect our tertiary operating costs to partially correlate with oil prices. They have steadily risen during the last few years as oil prices have generally gone up, but with the recent drop in oil prices, these costs are expected to decrease. The sale of our Louisiana natural gas properties (see Overview Sale of Louisiana Natural Gas Properties) also 47 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations increased our corporate average operating cost per BOE in 2008. If the sold properties were excluded from our operating results for the entire year of 2007, our operating costs would have been approximately $15.47 per BOE, approximately $1.13 per BOE higher than as reported. Production taxes and marketing expenses generally change in proportion to commodity prices and therefore have been higher in each of the last three years along with increasing commodity prices. Transportation and plant processing fees were approximately $8.4 million higher in 2008 than in 2007 and approximately $6.9 million higher in 2007 than in 2006, largely associated with the incremental production and incremental plant processing fees related to our Barnett Shale production. General and Administrative Expenses During the last three years, general and administrative (GA) expenses have increased on a gross basis, while fluctuating on a per BOE basis as outlined below: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net GA expense (thousands) Gross GA expense $ 137,979 $ 115,519 $ 96,479 State franchise taxes 3,415 2,915 1,825 Operator labor and overhead recovery charges (68,556 ) (59,145 ) (47,667 ) Capitalized exploration and development costs (12,464 ) (10,317 ) (7,623 ) Net GA expense $ 60,374 $ 48,972 $ 43,014 Average GA cost per BOE $ 3.56 $ 3.04 $ 3.20 Employees as of December 31 797 686 596 Gross GA expenses increased $22.5 million, or 19% between 2007 and 2008, and $19.0 million, or 20%, between 2006 and 2007. The increases are primarily due to higher compensation and personnel related costs caused by an increase in the number of employees and higher wages which we consider necessary in order to remain competitive in our industry. During 2007, we increased our employee count by 15%, and we further increased our employee count 16% during 2008. Stock compensation expense reflected in gross GA was $16.2 million during 2008, $12.2 million during 2007 and $18.9 million during 2006. The 2006 amount included $6.0 million of non recurring charges related to the retirement and departure of two vice presidents during 2006. Higher operator overhead recovery charges resulting from incremental activity helped to partially offset the increase in gross GA. Our well operating agreements allow us, when we are the operator, to charge a well with a specified overhead rate during the drilling phase and also to charge a monthly fixed overhead rate for each producing well. As a result of the additional operated wells from acquisitions, additional tertiary operations, increased drilling activity and increased compensation expense (including the allocation of that portion of stock compensation charged to lease operating expense), the amount we recovered as operator labor and overhead charges increased by 16% between 2007 and 2008, and 24% between 2006 and 2007. Capitalized exploration and development costs increased each year primarily due to additional personnel and increased compensation costs. The net effect of the increases in gross GA expenses, operator overhead recoveries and capitalized exploration costs was a 23% increase in net GA expense between 2007 and 2008, and a 14% increase in net GA expense between 2006 and 2007. On a per BOE basis, GA increased 17% in 2008 as compared to 2007 but GA per BOE decreased 5% in 2007 as compared to 2006 levels as higher production more than offset the increase in gross costs. 48 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Interest and Financing Expenses Year Ended December 31, Amounts in thousands, except per BOE data 2008 2007 2006 Cash interest expense $ 59,955 $ 49,205 $ 33,787 Non cash interest expense 1,802 2,010 1,121 Less: Capitalized interest (29,161 ) (20,385 ) (11,333 ) Interest expense $ 32,596 $ 30,830 $ 23,575 Interest and other income $ 4,834 $ 6,642 $ 5,603 Average net cash interest expense per BOE (1) $ 1.59 $ 1.43 $ 1.26 Average debt outstanding $ 735,288 $ 672,376 $ 455,603 Average interest rate (2) 8.2 % 7.3 % 7.4 % (1) Cash interest expense, less capitalized interest, less interest and other income on a BOE basis. (2) Includes commitment fees but excludes amortization of discount, premium and debt issue costs. Interest expense increased $1.8 million, or 6%, between 2007 and 2008, and $7.3 million, or 31%, between 2006 and 2007, primarily as a result of higher debt levels in the 2007 and 2008 periods, partially offset by higher capitalized interest during the 2007 and 2008 periods. Interest expense increased significantly during 2008 as a result of the two transactions with Genesis which were recorded as financing leases (see Overview Genesis Transactions) and which carry a higher imputed rate of interest. The higher rate of interest is partially offset by the cash distributions that we receive from Genesis, which have increased from $1.7 million in 2007 to $7.1 million during 2008. However, the cash receipts related to distributions from Genesis are not recognized in our income statement but rather as an adjustment to our investment account. Our interest capitalization increased in 2008 because of our growing balance of unevaluated property expenditures, expenditures on our CO2 pipeline projects and higher overall interest rates. Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization (DDA) and Full Cost Ceiling Test Write down Year Ended December 31, Amounts in thousands, except per BOE data 2008 2007 2006 Depletion and depreciation of oil and natural gas properties $ 192,791 $ 174,356 $ 132,880 Depletion and depreciation of CO2 assets 15,644 11,609 8,375 Asset retirement obligations 3,048 2,977 2,389 Depreciation of other fixed assets 10,309 6,958 5,521 Total DDA $ 221,792 $ 195,900 $ 149,165 DDA per BOE: Oil and natural gas properties $ 11.55 $ 11.02 $ 10.08 CO2 assets and other fixed assets 1.53 1.15 1.03 Total DDA cost per BOE $ 13.08 $ 12.17 $ 11.11 Full cost ceiling test write down $ 226,000 $ $ We adjust our DDA rate each quarter for significant changes in our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and costs, and thus our DDA rate could change significantly in the future. Our DDA rate per BOE, before the $226.0 million ($140.1 million net of tax) full cost ceiling write down in 2008, increased 7% between 2007 and 2008, and 10% between 2006 and 2007, primarily due to capital spending and increased costs. Our proved reserves increased from 174.3 MMBOE as of December 31, 2006, to 194.7 MMBOE as of December 31, 2007, and further increased to 250.5 MMBOE as of December 31, 2008. Our 2008 year end proved reserve quantities represent a 29% increase over proved reserves at the end of 2007, in spite of an estimated 13.8 MMBOE that were excluded as a result of the lower commodity prices at the end of 2008. We added a total of 88.9 MMBOE of proved reserves during 2008 (before netting out 2008 production, property sales and downward reserve revisions due to pricing), replacing approximately 525% of our 2008 49 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations production. The most significant reserve additions during 2008 were approximately 63.4 MMbbls added in our tertiary oil operations and approximately 117 Bcfe (19.5 MMBOE) in the Barnett Shale, both before netting out 2008 production. Our tertiary related oil reserves added during the year were primarily at Tinsley Field in Phase III (34.8 MMBOE), Heidelberg Field in Phase II (22.4 MMBOE) and Lockhart Crossing Field in Phase I (4.0 MMBOE). Even though the additional proved reserves were significant, at the same time that we recognize incremental proved tertiary oil reserves, we move any related costs for that field from unevaluated properties into the full cost pool. Usually, these unevaluated costs are significant and when combined with the estimated future development costs, the net impact of the DDA rate is usually minimal, and in some cases, increases the rate. Further, we generally do not initially recognize all of the potential tertiary oil reserves that we believe are recoverable, and therefore we expect to recognize incremental proved reserves at each of these tertiary fields in the future. These potential future reserves will have little or no cost associated with the incremental barrels; therefore, as these potential future reserves are recognized they will reduce the average ultimate cost per barrel. Approximately $76.6 million of our 2008 capital expenditures were incurred on properties for which there were no proved reserves at year end 2008 (primarily our new tertiary floods), and as such, were classified as unevaluated costs and did not affect our DDA rate. As part of the initial recognition of proved reserves at Tinsley, Heidelberg and Lockhart Crossing Fields during 2008, approximately $284.6 million of previously unevaluated costs were moved to the full cost pool. Our DDA rate during the fourth quarter of 2008 was also negatively impacted by the exclusion of approximately 13.8 MMBOE due to the decrease in commodity prices. Had these reserves been included, the DDA rate on oil and gas properties for the fourth quarter of 2008 would have been approximately $11.32 per BOE, rather than the $11.92 per BOE that was reported. Our DDA rate for our CO2 and other fixed assets increased in both 2007 and 2008 as a result of the Free State CO2 Pipeline that was placed into service in 2006, the Lockhart Crossing CO2 pipeline placed into service during 2007, the Tinsley and Heidelberg CO2 pipelines placed into service during 2008, drilling costs for additional CO2 wells, and the expansion of our corporate office space during 2008. As part of the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred, discounted to its present value using our credit adjusted risk free interest rate, with a corresponding capitalized amount. The liability is accreted each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. On an undiscounted basis, we estimated our retirement obligations as of December 31, 2006, to be $91.3 million ($41.1 million present value), with an estimated salvage value of $60.0 million. As of December 31, 2007, we estimated our retirement obligations to be $100.6 million ($41.3 million present value), with an estimated salvage value of $67.3 million, and as of December 31, 2008, we estimated our retirement obligations to be $106.4 million ($45.1 million present value), with an estimated salvage value of $76.4 million, the increase related to 2008 activity and higher cost estimates due to the inflation in our industry, partially offset by a decrease in our obligation of approximately $9.5 million, ($9.3 million present value) related to the sale of most of our Louisiana natural gas properties in late 2007 and early 2008. DDA is calculated on the increase in retirement obligations recorded as incremental oil and natural gas and CO2 properties, net of its estimated salvage value. We also include the accretion of discount on the asset retirement obligation in our DDA expense. Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation. We have not had any full cost pool ceiling test write downs since 1998. However, during 2008, commodity prices were volatile, with oil NYMEX prices moving from $95.98 per Bbl at December 31, 2007 to $140.00 per Bbl at June 30, 2008 then down to $44.60 per Bbl at December 31, 2008. Likewise, natural gas NYMEX prices went from $7.48 per Mcf as of December 31, 2007 to $13.35 per Mcf at June 30, 2008 and down to $5.62 per Mcf as of December 31, 2008. Because of the 54% decrease in NYMEX oil price and 25% decrease in NYMEX natural gas price between year end 2007 and year end 2008, we recognized a full cost pool ceiling test write down at December 31, 2008 of $226.0 million, or $13.32 per BOE. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, oil and natural gas prices have continued their volatility and are currently at levels lower than at year end 2008. If oil and natural gas prices remain at these lower levels through March 31, 2009, or subsequent periods, we may be required to record additional write downs under the full cost ceiling test in the first quarter of 2009, or in subsequent periods. The amount of any future write down is difficult to predict and will depend upon the oil and natural gas prices at the end of each period, the incremental proved reserves that might be added during each period and additional capital spent. 50 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

Our effective tax rate has generally been less than our estimated statutory rate due to the impact of certain items such as our domestic production activities deduction, partially offset by compensation arising from incentive stock options that cannot be deducted for tax purposes in the same manner as book expense. The reduction in the estimated statutory rate to 38% in 2008 and 2007 was a result of our sale of our Louisiana natural gas assets during the fourth quarter of 2007. In 2008, we received permission from the IRS to change our method of tax accounting for certain assets used in our tertiary recovery operations (see Overview Change in Tax Accounting Method for Certain Tertiary Costs). In all three periods, the current income tax expense represents our anticipated alternative minimum cash taxes that we cannot offset with enhanced oil recovery (EOR) credits. As of December 31, 2008, we had an estimated $44 million of EOR credit carryforwards that we can utilize to reduce a portion of our cash taxes. These EOR credits do not begin to expire until 2022. Since the ability to earn additional enhanced oil recovery credits is based upon the level of oil prices, we may earn EOR credits again in the future if oil prices remain at their currently depressed levels. Results of Operations on a Per BOE Basis The following table summarizes the cash flow, DDA and results of operations on a per BOE basis for the comparative periods.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Management Debt We finance some of our acquisitions and other expenditures with fixed and variable rate debt. These debt agreements expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We had $75 million of bank debt outstanding as of December 31, 2008, and $60 million outstanding as of February 27, 2009. The carrying value of our bank debt is approximately fair value based on the fact that it is subject to short term floating interest rates that approximate the rates available to us for those periods. We adjusted the estimated fair value measurements of our bank debt at December 31, 2008 in accordance with SFAS No. 157 for estimated nonperformance risk. This estimated nonperformance risk totaled approximately $11.0 million and was determined utilizing industry credit default swaps. None of our existing debt has any triggers or covenants regarding our debt ratings with rating agencies, although under the NEJD financing lease with Genesis (see Overview Genesis Transactions) in the event of significant downgrades of our corporate credit rating by the rating agencies, Genesis can require certain credit enhancements from us, and possibly other remedies under the lease. The fair value of the subordinated debt is based on quoted market prices. The following table presents the carrying and fair values of our debt, along with average interest rates at December 31, 2008.

We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. These contracts have consisted of price floors, collars and fixed price swaps. The production that we hedge has varied from year to year depending on our levels of debt and financial strength and expectation of future commodity prices. Historically, we hedged up to 80% of our anticipated production to provide us with a reasonably certain amount of cash flow to cover most of our budgeted exploration and development expenditures without incurring significant debt. In late 2006, we swapped 80% to 90% of our forecasted 2007 natural gas production at a weighted average price of $7.96 per Mcf, and in September 2007 we swapped 70% to 80% of our remaining forecasted 2008 natural gas production (after the sale of our Louisiana natural gas properties see 2008 Overview Sale of Louisiana Natural Gas Assets) at a weighted average price of $7.91 per Mcf. We cancelled the December 2008 natural gas swaps in the third quarter of 2008 because of our plans at that time to sell our Barnett Shale properties, receiving approximately $61,000 from the cancellation. As a result of the current economic conditions and in order to protect our liquidity in the event that commodity prices continue to decline, during early October 2008, we purchased oil derivative contracts for 2009 with a floor price of $75 / Bbl and a ceiling price of $115 / Bbl for total consideration of $15.5 million. The collars cover 30,000 Bbls/d representing approximately 80% of our currently anticipated 2009 oil production. These 2009 contracts were entered into with the following counterparties: JPMorgan Chase Bank (10,000 Bbls/d), Wells Fargo Bank (7,500 Bbls/d), Keybank (5,000 Bbls/d), Fortis Energy Marketing and Trading GP (5,000 Bbls/d) and Comerica Bank (2,500 Bbls/d). Historically, when we made a significant acquisition, we generally attempted to hedge a large percentage, up to 100%, of the forecasted proved production for the subsequent one to three years following the acquisition in order to help provide us with a minimum return on our investment. For 2008, we had derivative contracts in place related to our $250 million acquisition that closed on January 31, 2006, on which we entered into contracts to cover 100% of the first three years of estimated proved producing production at the time we signed the purchase and sale agreement. These swaps covered 2,000 Bbls/d for 2008 at a price of $57.34 per Bbl. All of the mark to market valuations used for our oil and natural gas derivatives are provided by external sources and are based on prices that are actively quoted. We manage and control market and counterparty credit risk through established internal control procedures that are reviewed on an ongoing basis. We attempt to minimize 52 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies, monitoring procedures and diversification. We have included an estimate of nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of our oil derivative contracts as required by SFAS No. 157. At December 31, 2008, all of our oil derivative contracts are in an asset position. Therefore, in assessing the nonperformance risk of the counterparties to these contracts, we have measured the risk by using credit default swaps as we believe this data is the most responsive to current market events. If a counter party did not have credit default swaps associated with that specific entity, we utilized industry credit default swaps as an estimate of the fair value of this risk associated with that entity. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of our oil derivative contracts was reduced by $3.7 million for the estimated nonperformance risk of our counterparties. For accounting purposes, we do not apply hedge accounting for our oil and natural gas derivative contracts. This means that any changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion to earnings. Information regarding our current derivative contract positions and results of our historical derivative activity is included in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2008, our derivative contracts were recorded at their fair value, which was a net asset of approximately $249.7 million, an increase of $273.0 million from the $23.3 million fair value liability recorded as of December 31, 2007. This change is primarily related to the declining oil prices which significantly increased the value of our 2009 oil collars, and the expiration of our natural gas hedges during 2008. During 2008, we recognized total income related to our hedge contracts of $200.1 million, consisting of $57.5 million of net cash payments on settlements of expired contracts, and $257.6 million of income relating to mark to market non cash adjustments. Based on NYMEX crude oil futures prices at December 31, 2008, we would expect to receive future cash payments of $229.8 million on our crude oil commodity derivative contracts. If crude oil futures prices were to decline by 10%, we would expect to receive future cash payments on our crude oil commodity derivative contracts of $289.0 million, and if futures prices were to increase by 10% we would expect to receive $170.7 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we select certain accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments regarding the application of those policies. Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements. Full Cost Method of Accounting, Depletion and Depreciation and Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Businesses involved in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. We apply the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Another acceptable method of accounting for oil and gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting. In general, the primary differences between the two methods are related to the capitalization of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment. Under the full cost method, all geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool, whereas under the successful efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred. In the assessment of impairment of oil and gas properties, the successful efforts method follows the guidance of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, under which the net book value of assets are measured for impairment against the undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method, the full cost pool (net book value of oil and gas properties) is measured against future cash flows discounted at 10% using commodity prices in effect at the end of the reporting period. The financial results for a given period could be substantially different depending on the method of accounting that an oil and gas entity applies. Further, we do not designate our oil and natural gas derivative contracts as hedge instruments for accounting purposes under SFAS No. 133, and as a result, these contracts are not considered in the full cost ceiling test. In our application of full cost accounting for our oil and gas producing activities, we make significant estimates at the end of each period related to accruals for oil and gas revenues, production, capitalized costs and operating expenses. We calculate these estimates with our best available data, which includes, among other things, production reports, price posting, information compiled from daily drilling reports and other internal tracking devices, and analysis of historical results and trends. While management is not aware of any required revisions to its 53 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations estimates, there will likely be future adjustments resulting from such things as changes in ownership interests, payouts, joint venture audits, re allocations by the purchaser/pipeline, or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and natural gas industry, many of which will require retroactive application. These types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated or determined and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs. Under full cost accounting, the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom used to perform the full cost ceiling test have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible, including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare the report, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statement disclosures. Over the last four years, Denburys annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately 3.3% of the previous years estimates and have been both positive and negative. Changes in commodity prices also affect our reserve quantities. During 2006 and 2007, the change to reserve quantities related to commodity prices was relatively small as prices were relatively high each year end; however, at December 31, 2008 the lower commodity prices lowered our proved reserves by 13.8 MMBOE. These changes in quantities affect our DDA rate, and the combined effect of changes in quantities and commodity prices impacts our full cost ceiling test calculation. For example, we estimate that a 5% increase in our estimate of proved reserves quantities would have lowered our fourth quarter 2008 DDA rate from $13.72 per BOE to approximately $13.17 per BOE, and a 5% decrease in our proved reserve quantities would have increased our DDA rate to approximately $14.33 per BOE. Also, reserve quantities and their ultimate values are the primary factors in determining the borrowing base under our bank credit facility and are determined solely by our banks. Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation. We did not have any full cost pool ceiling test write downs in 2006 or 2007. However, during 2008, commodity prices were volatile, with oil NYMEX prices moving from $95.98 per Bbl at December 31, 2007 to $140.00 per Bbl at June 30, 2008 then down to $44.60 per Bbl at December 31, 2008. Likewise, natural gas NYMEX prices went from $7.48 per Mcf as of December 31, 2007 to $13.35 per Mcf at June 30, 2008 and down to $5.62 per Mcf as of December 31, 2008. Because of the 54% decrease in NYMEX oil price and 25% decrease in NYMEX natural gas price between year end 2007 and year end 2008, we recognized a full cost pool ceiling test write down during 2008 of $226.0 million, or $13.32 per BOE. Commodity prices have historically been volatile and are expected to be in the future. If oil and natural gas prices remain at these lower levels through March 31, 2009, or subsequent periods, we may be required to record additional write downs due to the full cost ceiling test in the first quarter of 2009, or in subsequent periods. The amount of any future write down is difficult to predict and will depend upon the oil and natural gas prices at the end of each period, the incremental proved reserves that might be added during each period and additional capital spent. There can also be significant questions as to whether reserves are sufficiently supported by technical evidence to be considered proven. In some cases our proven reserves are less than what we believe to exist because additional evidence, including production testing, is required in order to classify the reserves as proven. We have a corporate policy whereby we generally do not book proved undeveloped reserves unless the project has been committed to internally, which normally means it is scheduled within the subsequent three years (or at least the commencement of the project is scheduled in the case of longer term multi year projects such as waterfloods and tertiary recovery projects). Therefore, with regard to potential reserves, there is uncertainty as to whether the reserves should be included as proven or not. We also have a corporate policy whereby proved undeveloped reserves must be economic at long term historical prices, which have generally been significantly less than the year end prices used in our reserve report. This also can have the effect of eliminating certain projects being included in our estimates of proved reserves, which projects would otherwise be included if undeveloped reserves were determined to be economic solely based on current prices in a high price environment, as was the case during 2006 and 2007 year ends. (See Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization under Results of Operations above for further discussion.) All of these factors and the decisions made regarding these issues can have a significant effect on our proven reserves and thus on our DDA rate, full cost ceiling test calculation, borrowing base and financial statements. See 54 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations also discussion of requirements to book proven tertiary oil reserves at Results of Operations Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization. Tertiary Injection Costs Our tertiary operations are conducted in reservoirs that have already produced significant amounts of oil over many years; however, in accordance with the rules for recording proved reserves, we cannot recognize proved reserves associated with enhanced recovery techniques, such as CO2 injection, until there is a production response to the injected CO2 or, unless the field is analogous to an existing flood. Our costs associated with the CO2 we produce (or acquire) and inject are principally our costs of production, transportation and acquisition, and to pay royalties. Prior to January 1, 2008, we expensed currently all costs associated with injecting CO2 that we used in our tertiary recovery operations, even though some of these costs were incurred prior to any tertiary related oil production. Commencing January 1, 2008, we began capitalizing, as a development cost, injection costs in fields that are in their development stage, which means we have not yet seen incremental oil production due to the CO2 injections (i.e. a production response). These capitalized development costs will be included in our unevaluated property costs within our full cost pool if there are not already proved tertiary reserves in that field. After we see a production response to the CO2 injections (i.e. the production stage), injection costs will be expensed as incurred and any previously deferred unevaluated development costs will become subject to depletion upon recognition of proved tertiary reserves. Had the new method of accounting for tertiary injection costs been used in periods prior to January 1, 2008, the effect on our financial statements would have been immaterial for all periods presented. During 2008, we capitalized $10.4 million of tertiary injection costs associated with our tertiary projects that we would have previously expensed. Asset Retirement Obligations We have significant obligations related to the plugging and abandonment of our oil, natural gas and CO2 wells, the removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and land restoration. SFAS No. 143 requires that we estimate the future cost of this obligation, discount it to its present value, and record a corresponding asset and liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates, including the ultimate expected cost of the obligation, the expected future date of the required cash payment, and interest and inflation rates. Revisions to these estimates may be required based on changes to cost estimates, the timing of settlement, and changes in legal requirements. Any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis and an adjustment in our DDA expense in future periods. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our asset retirement obligations. Income Taxes We make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. Our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes, tax credits and, net operating loss carryforwards. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns. Further, we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets (primarily our enhanced oil recovery credits). If recovery is not likely, we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover, which would result in an increase to our income tax expense. As of December 31, 2008, we believe that all of our deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet will ultimately be recovered. If our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not more likely than not. A 1% increase in our effective tax rate would have increased our calculated income tax expense by approximately $6.2 million, $3.9 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning our income taxes. 55 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Contracts We enter into oil and natural gas derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with future oil and natural gas production. These contracts have historically consisted of options, in the form of price floors or collars, and fixed price swaps. We do not designate these derivative commodity contracts as hedge instruments for accounting purposes under SFAS No. 133. This means that any changes in the future fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the balance to earnings. While we may experience more volatility in our net income than if we were to apply hedge accounting treatment as permitted by SFAS No. 133, we believe that for us the benefits associated with applying hedge accounting do not outweigh the cost, time and effort to comply with hedge accounting. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized expense (income) of ($257.6) million, $39.1 million and ($25.1) million, respectively, related to changes in the fair market value of our derivative contracts. Stock Compensation Plans SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment requires that we recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the financial statements. We estimate the fair value of stock option or stock appreciation right (SAR) awards on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option valuation model requires the input of somewhat subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and expected term. Other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the Black Scholes model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of the Companys stock. The risk free interest rates used are the U.S. Treasury yield for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant. Our dividend yield is zero, as Denbury does not pay a dividend. We utilize historical experience in arriving at our assumptions for volatility and expected term inputs. We recognize the stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. The expense we recognize is net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate our forfeiture rate based on prior experience and true it up for actual results as the awards vest. As of December 31, 2008, there was $12.5 million of total compensation cost to be recognized in future periods related to non vested stock options and SARs. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires us to make other estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reliable, and believe that the ultimate actual results will not differ significantly from those reported; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and such risks and uncertainties could cause the actual results to differ materially from our estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Business Combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2008), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. We do not anticipate the adoption of SFAS 141(R) will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations, absent any material business combinations. Noncontrolling Interests. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parents ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. This statement is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. Since we currently do not have any noncontrolling interests, SFAS No. 160 does not presently have any impact on us. 56 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 161 requires entities that utilize derivative instruments to provide qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using such instruments, as well as any details of credit risk related contingent features contained within derivatives. SFAS No. 161 also requires entities to disclose additional information about the amounts and location of derivatives located within the financial statements, how the provisions of SFAS No. 133 have been applied, and the impact that hedges have on an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. As its only requirement is to enhance disclosures, SFAS No. 161 will not have a significant impact on us. Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting. On December 31, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted major revisions to its rules governing oil and gas company reporting requirements. These include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves, and that allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors. The current rules limit disclosure to only proved reserves. The new disclosure requirements also require companies that have an audit performed of their reserves to report the independence and qualifications of the auditor of the reserve estimates, and to file reports when a third party reserve engineer is relied upon to prepare reserve estimates. The new rules also require that oil and gas reserves be reported and the full cost ceiling value calculated using an average price based upon the prior 12 month period. The new oil and gas reporting requirements are effective for annual reports on Forms 10 K for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009, with early adoption not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the new rules may have on our financial condition or results of operations. Forward Looking Information The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements found in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are forward looking statements, as that term is defined in Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be or may concern, among other things, forecasted capital expenditures, drilling activity or methods, acquisition plans and proposals and dispositions, development activities, cost savings, capital budgets, production rates and volumes or forecasts thereof, hydrocarbon reserve quantities and values, CO2 reserves, potential reserves from tertiary operations, hydrocarbon prices, pricing or cost assumptions based on current and projected oil and gas prices, liquidity, cash flows, availability of capital, borrowing capacity, regulatory matters, mark to market values, competition, long term forecasts of production, finding costs, rates of return, estimated costs, or changes in costs, future capital expenditures and overall economics and other variables surrounding our operations and future plans. Such forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as plan, estimate, expect, predict, anticipate, projected, should, assume, believe, target or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Such forward looking information is based upon managements current plans, expectations, estimates and assumptions and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect current plans, anticipated actions, the timing of such actions and the Companys financial condition and results of operations. As a consequence, actual results may differ materially from expectations, estimates or assumptions expressed in or implied by any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are: fluctuations of the prices received or demand for the Companys oil and natural gas; inaccurate cost estimates; availability of and fluctuations in the prices of goods and services; the uncertainty of drilling results and reserve estimates; operating hazards; disruption of operations and damages from hurricanes or tropical storms; acquisition risks; requirements for capital or its availability; conditions in the financial and credit markets; general economic conditions; competition and government regulations; and unexpected delays, as well as the risks and uncertainties inherent in oil and gas drilling and production activities or which are otherwise discussed in this annual report, including, without limitation, the portions referenced above, and the uncertainties set forth from time to time in the Companys other public reports, filings and public statements. This Annual Report is not deemed to be soliciting material or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934. 57 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
