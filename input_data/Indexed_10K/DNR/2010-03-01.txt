Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Our discussion and analysis includes forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with Risk Factors under Item 1A of this report, along with Forward Looking Information at the end of this section for information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than our forward looking statements. The following discussion and analysis does not include information regarding results of operations and financial condition of Encore, which is contained in Encores Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2009, filed by Encore with the SEC on February 25, 2010. Overview We are a growing independent oil and natural gas company engaged in acquisition, development and exploration activities in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. We are the largest oil and natural gas producer in Mississippi, own the largest carbon dioxide (CO2) reserves east of the Mississippi River used for tertiary oil recovery, and hold significant operating acreage in properties onshore in Louisiana, Alabama and Southeast Texas. Our goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling, and proven engineering extraction processes, with our most significant emphasis relating to tertiary recovery operations. Our corporate headquarters are in Plano, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), and we have four primary field offices located in Laurel, Mississippi; Jackson, Mississippi; Little Creek, Mississippi; and Alvin, Texas. During 2009, we entered into several strategic transactions to expand our primary business of CO2 tertiary operations, as follows: purchased Hastings Field in southeast Texas in February; purchased Conroe Field in the same area in December; on October 31st agreed to acquire Encore Acquisition Company, subject to approval of each companys shareholders on March 9, 2010; divested non strategic operations in the Barnett Shale; and entered into an agreement to sell our interests in the General Partner of Genesis Energy, L.P. and subsequently closed this transaction in February 2010. Each of these transactions, which are further discussed below, supports our strategic emphasis on further developing and expanding our CO2 tertiary operations and should provide future growth in our CO2 tertiary operations for many years to come. In addition, during 2009 we invested approximately $538 million in our Green Pipeline, which when finished will transport CO2 from the end of our NEJD Pipeline, in Louisiana, to our tertiary floods in southeast Texas. 2009 Operating Highlights. We recognized a net loss of $75.2 million during 2009, or ($0.30) per common share, compared to net income of $388.4 million, or $1.59 per common share earned during 2008. The reduction in net income between the two years is primarily due to lower oil and natural gas commodity prices and non cash expense of $383.0 million ($237.4 million after tax) in 2009 due to the changes in fair value of our commodity derivative contracts. In 2008, we recorded a non cash gain of $257.6 million ($159.7 million after tax) on the fair value changes in our commodity derivative contracts, which was primarily offset by a $226.0 million ($140.1 million after tax) full cost ceiling test write down at December 31, 2008. Oil and natural gas prices continued to be volatile during 2009, but generally trended upward during the year, as compared to the latter part of 2008 when oil and natural gas prices dropped significantly from their highs in mid 2008. Our average revenue per BOE, excluding the impact of oil and natural gas derivative contracts, was $49.16 per BOE in 2009, as compared to $79.42 per BOE in 2008, a 38% decrease between the two periods. Although our production increased between 2008 and 2009, the significant drop in commodity prices resulted in a 36% decrease in our oil and natural gas revenues during 2009 as compared to 2008. During 2009, our oil and natural gas production averaged 48,299 BOE/d, a 4% increase over the average production for 2008; however, our continuing production excluding the production from our Barnett Shale 39 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations properties that were sold in 2009 increased 15%. Our largest production increases were attributable to our tertiary oil production and Hastings Field, which we acquired in February 2009, partially offset by (a) the sale of our Barnett Shale natural gas properties; and (b) expected declines in our Mississippi non tertiary production primarily due to lower Selma Chalk natural gas production as a result of limited drilling activity in 2009, and to a lesser extent due to lower non tertiary Heidelberg oil production as additional areas of that field were shut in in order to expand the tertiary flooding to those areas. See Results of Operations Operating Results Production for more information. Tertiary oil production averaged 24,343 BOE/d during 2009, representing a 26% increase over our tertiary oil production during 2008. We had strong production increases during 2009 from several of our existing tertiary oil fields, and had initial production response from CO2 injections at Heidelberg Field during the second quarter of 2009 and at Cranfield Field during the first quarter of 2009. See Results of Operations CO2 Operations for more information. Cash settlements received on our commodity derivative contracts during 2009 were $146.7 million, compared to payments of $57.5 million made during 2008. During 2009, we had a non cash fair value charge on our derivative contracts of $383.0 million, compared to a non cash fair value gain of $257.6 million in 2008. Coupled together, our total adjustments on derivative contracts resulted in a net change between 2008 and 2009 of $436.3 million of additional expense in 2009. Our lease operating expenses increased 6% between 2008 and 2009, primarily due to our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations, increasing utility and electrical costs to operate our fields, and increasing lease payments for certain equipment in our tertiary operating facilities. General and administrative expenses increased significantly from 2008 levels due to increased compensation and personnel related costs, incentive compensation awards for certain members of management of Genesis, $10.0 million paid under a Founders Retirement Agreement, and acquisition related expenses associated with the Encore merger agreement. Interest expense also increased during 2009, due primarily to the February issuance of $420 million of 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 and the pipeline dropdown transactions with Genesis, which were completed mid 2008, offset in part by increasing interest capitalization related to our CO2 pipelines under construction. Definitive Merger Agreement to Acquire Encore Acquisition Company. On November 1, 2009, Denbury and Encore announced that we had entered into a definitive merger agreement providing for Encore to merge with and into Denbury, in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $4.5 billion at that time, including the assumption of debt and the value of the general partner units and limited partner units held by Encore in Encore MLP. The combined company will continue to be known as Denbury Resources Inc. and will be headquartered in Plano, Texas. The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both Denbury and Encore. The Merger Agreement contemplates a merger whereby Denbury and Encore have agreed to combine their businesses such that Encore will be merged with and into Denbury, with Denbury surviving the Merger. The Merger is subject to the stockholders of each of Denbury and Encore approving the Merger, including approval by Denburys stockholders of the issuance of Denbury common stock to be used as Merger consideration. Each company has scheduled a special stockholder meeting on March 9, 2010, for stockholders to vote on the merger. Under the agreement, Encore stockholders will receive $50.00 per share for each share of Encore common stock, comprised of $15.00 in cash and $35.00 in Denbury common stock, subject to both an election feature and a collar mechanism on the stock portion of the consideration as set forth in more detail below. Merger Agreement In calculating the exchange ratio range for the collar mechanism, the Denbury common stock was initially valued at $15.10 per share. The collar mechanism is limited to a 12% upward or downward movement in the Denbury share price. The final number of Denbury shares to be issued will be adjusted based on the volume weighted average price of Denbury common stock on the NYSE for the 20 day trading period ending on the second day prior to closing. Based on this mechanism, if Denbury stock trades between $13.29 and $16.91, the Encore stockholders will receive between 2.0698 and 2.6336 shares of Denbury common stock for each of their shares of Encore common stock, but not higher or lower than these share amounts if Denbury common stock trades outside this range. If Denbury common stock trades outside of this range, the value of the shares of Denbury received will 40 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations represent either more or less than $35 per share. Based on the number of shares of Encore common stock outstanding as of February 3, 2010, we would issue to Encore stockholders between 115 million and 146 million shares of our common stock in the Merger, which will represent an increase in our aggregate shares outstanding of between 44% and 56%. The Merger Agreement contains customary covenants by each party to the Merger Agreement and consummation of the Merger is subject to customary conditions. The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights for both us and Encore, including, among others, if the Merger has not occurred on or before May 31, 2010 with termination fees in varying amounts payable by us or by Encore based upon specified reasons for termination. See Business Definitive Merger Agreement to Acquire Encore Acquisition Company. Financing of the Merger We received a financing commitment from J.P. Morgan, subject to customary conditions, to underwrite a new $1.6 billion senior secured revolving credit facility. We have been advised by the co arrangers of this new senior secured revolving credit facility, J.P. Morgan and Bank of America, N.A. that the syndication phase is complete, and documentation for this facility is being prepared. Subject to final documentation and satisfaction of closing conditions, we anticipate finalizing this facility prior to the Denbury and Encore stockholder meetings. The newly committed financing, coupled with the funds from our recent subordinated debt offering (see next paragraph), will be used to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration (inclusive of payments due to Encore stock option holders), repay amounts outstanding under our existing $750 million revolving credit facility, which had $125 million outstanding as of February 15, 2010, potentially retire and replace a portion of up to $825 million of Encores senior subordinated notes that are outstanding, all of which have a change of control put option at 101% of par value, repay amounts outstanding under Encores existing revolving credit facility which had $155 million outstanding as of February 15, 2010, pay Encores severance costs, pay transaction fees and expenses and provide additional liquidity. The aggregate commitment of the senior secured lenders is a $1.6 billion facility with a term of four years. The new facility is expected to be on substantially the same terms as our existing facility, conformed to current market conditions. We also received a financing commitment from J.P. Morgan for a $1.25 billion unsecured bridge loan facility; however, this bridge loan facility has been terminated and will not be utilized to fund the Merger as we have instead issued $1 billion of 8.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020. On February 10, 2010, we sold $1 billion of 8.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 at 100% of par in a public offering. The net proceeds from the notes offering were placed in escrow pending the closing of the Merger, subject to mandatory redemption of the notes if the Merger does not close, and partial redemption of the notes to the extent that three series of Encore outstanding senior subordinated notes are not repurchased. Upon the closing of the Merger, $400 million of the escrowed proceeds will be released to us to finance a portion of the Merger consideration, and the remaining escrowed proceeds will be used to fund repurchases of up to $600 million principal amount of three series of Encores outstanding senior subordinated notes (or newly issued 8.25% senior notes to the extent not issued to repurchase Encore notes). On February 8, 2010, we initiated a tender offer for these Encore subordinated notes, the closing of which is subject to the closing of the Merger. Sale of Interests in General Partner of Genesis Energy, L.P. On February 5, 2010, Denbury and one of its subsidiaries sold all of the subsidiarys interests in Genesis Energy, LLC, the general partner of Genesis Energy, L.P., or Genesis, to an affiliate of Quintana Capital Group L.P., for net proceeds of approximately $82 million (including amounts related to Genesis management incentive compensation and other selling costs). This sale gives the buyer control of Genesis general partner. The sale of Denburys interest in the general partner does not include the sale of its approximate 10% ownership of Genesis outstanding common units, which Denbury currently still owns and for which a resale registration statement was filed in January 2010. Conroe Field Acquisition. On December 18, 2009, we purchased from Wapiti Energy, LLC, Wapiti Operating, LLC and Wapiti Gathering, LLC (collectively, Wapiti), a Houston based privately owned company, oil and natural gas assets in the Conroe Field for total consideration of $422.9 million (after preliminary purchase price adjustments), consisting of $254.2 million in cash and 11,620,000 shares of Denbury common stock, which for the purpose of estimated fair value under FASC Business Combinations topic, we utilized the closing stock price on that date of $14.52 per share resulting in a total value of $168.7 million. We also exchanged cash for approximately $15.6 million of escrow account deposits reserved for plugging and abandonment. We have internally estimated 41 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations that the Conroe Field interests have significant estimated net reserve potential from CO2 tertiary recovery, the largest EOR potential of our Gulf Coast oil fields. The acquired Conroe Field interests have estimated proved conventional reserves of approximately 18.5 MMBbls at December 31, 2009, nearly all of which are proved developed. The Conroe Field assets are currently producing around 2,500 BOE/d net to our acquired interest. We have recorded the acquisition of Conroe Field in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards CodificationTM (FASC) Business Combinations topic, which became effective for acquisitions after December 31, 2008. Based on these new rules, we have allocated $304.3 million of the $438.5 million adjusted purchase price (includes escrow deposits) to proved properties, $93.6 million to unevaluated properties, approximately $15.6 million to other assets, $5.7 million to asset retirement obligations and the net remaining $30.7 million to goodwill. See further discussion on this acquisition in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sale of Barnett Shale Natural Gas Assets. In May 2009, we entered into an agreement to sell 60% of our Barnett Shale assets to Talon Oil and Gas LLC (Talon), a privately held company, for $270 million (before closing adjustments). On June 30, 2009, we completed approximately three quarters of the sale, and closed the remaining portion of the sale on July 15, 2009. Net proceeds were $259.8 million (after closing adjustments, and net of $8.1 million paid to Talon for natural gas swaps transferred in the sale). We did not record a gain or loss on the sale in accordance with the full cost method of accounting. On December 30, 2009, we sold our remaining 40% interest in our Barnett Shale natural gas assets to Talon for $210 million in cash, subject to closing adjustments. The proceeds of the sale were used to reduce outstanding bank debt. The sale was structured as a deferred like kind exchange in conjunction with Denburys purchase of Conroe Field that closed on December 18, 2009. Mid Year Management Changes. On June 30, 2009, under a management succession plan adopted by our Board of Directors and announced on February 5, 2009, Gareth Roberts, the Companys founder, relinquished his position as President and CEO and became Co Chairman of the Board of Directors and assumed a non officer role as the Companys Chief Strategist. Phil Rykhoek, previously Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, became Chief Executive Officer; Tracy Evans, previously Senior Vice President Reservoir Engineering, became President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Allen, previously Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, became Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In connection with Mr. Roberts retirement as CEO and President of the Company, Mr. Roberts and the Company entered into a Founders Retirement Agreement (the Agreement). Under this Agreement, Mr. Roberts received $3.65 million in cash and the Company issued to him $6.35 million of the Companys 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016. As part of the Agreement, there are restrictions that prohibit Mr. Roberts from trading these notes for two years, and he has entered into a non compete arrangement with the Company through 2013. Mr. Roberts will continue to provide services to the Company as Co Chairman of the Board of Directors and in a non officer role as Chief Strategist. Purchase of Hastings Field. On February 2, 2009, we closed the acquisition of Hastings Field located near Houston, Texas, for approximately $201 million in cash. Hastings Field is a significant potential tertiary oil flood that we plan to flood with CO2 delivered from Jackson Dome using our Green Pipeline, which is currently under construction. We originally entered into an agreement in November 2006 with a subsidiary of Venoco, Inc., that gave us the option to purchase its interest in the Hastings Field. As consideration for the purchase option, we made total payments of $50 million which makes our aggregate purchase price $251 million. The seller retained a 2% override and reversionary interest of approximately 25% following payout, as defined in the purchase agreement. We plan to commence flooding the field with CO2 beginning in 2011, after completion of our Green Pipeline and construction of field recycling facilities. Under the purchase agreement, we are required to make net capital expenditures in this field totaling $179 million over the next five years, including our first obligation of $26.8 million during 2010, and are committed to begin CO2 injections averaging 50 MMcf/d by the fourth quarter of 2012. Production from this field averaged 1,956 BOE/d during 2009, all of which was non tertiary production. At December 31, 2009, the Hastings Field had proved reserves of 8.9 MMBbls. We have recorded the acquisition of Hastings Field in accordance with FASC Business Combinations topic, which became effective for acquisitions after December 31, 2008. Based on these new rules, we have allocated 42 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations $107.6 million of the $246.8 million adjusted purchase price to proved properties, approximately $2.4 million to land, oilfield equipment and other related assets, $2.0 million to asset retirement obligations and the net remaining $138.8 million to goodwill. See further discussion regarding this acquisition in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. February 2009 Subordinated Debt Issuance. On February 13, 2009, we issued $420 million of 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the Notes). The Notes were sold to the public at 92.816% of par, plus accrued interest from February 13, 2009, which equates to an effective yield to maturity of approximately 11.25% (before offering expenses). Interest on the Notes will be paid on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The Notes will mature on March 1, 2016. We used the net proceeds from the offering of approximately $381.4 million to repay most of the then outstanding debt on our bank credit facility. We issued an additional $6.35 million of Notes to Mr. Roberts on June 30, 2009 (see Mid Year Management Changes above). Capital Resources and Liquidity General During 2009, we took several steps to ensure that we had adequate capital resources and liquidity in order to fund our capital expenditure program and to complete two strategic acquisitions, the Hastings Field and the Conroe Field. Those steps included the issuance of $420 million of 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes in February 2009, the sale of 60% of our Barnett Shale assets in mid 2009, and the sale of the remaining 40% of our Barnett Shale assets during December 2009. We used the $381.4 million net proceeds from the February 2009 Notes issuance to repay the majority of our then outstanding bank debt, and we did the same with the proceeds from our December 2009 Barnett Shale sale, freeing up our credit line for future capital needs. Denbury Stand Alone We currently estimate our 2010 capital spending will be approximately $650 million, excluding capitalized interest and net of equipment leases, and any expenditures related to the Encore acquisition. Our current 2010 capital budget includes approximately $74 million to be spent in the Jackson Dome area, $159 million to be spent on our CO2 pipelines and approximately $365 million allocated for tertiary oil field expenditures. This estimate also assumes that we fund approximately $50 million of budgeted equipment purchases with operating leases, which is dependent upon securing acceptable financing. If we do not enter into a total of $50 million of operating leases during 2010, our net capital expenditures would increase accordingly, and we would anticipate funding those additional capital expenditures under our bank credit line. We did not enter into as many operating leases during 2009 as we had anticipated, leasing approximately $49 million of equipment out of a projected total of $100 million, which resulted in a corresponding net increase in capital expenditures and bank debt. Potentially, during 2010 we could lease all or a portion of this equipment. Based on oil and natural gas commodity futures prices as of late February 2010 and our current 2010 production forecasts, our stand alone 2010 capital budget is expected to be $150 million to $250 million greater than our anticipated cash flow from operations on a stand alone basis. We plan to fund this shortfall with cash generated from the sale of our general partnership interest in Genesis (see Sale of Interests in General Partner of Genesis Energy, L.P. above), the anticipated sale of our limited partnership units in Genesis Energy, L.P., and the remainder from borrowings under our bank facility. As of February 15, 2010, we had $125 million of bank debt outstanding on our $750 million committed bank facility, leaving us significant incremental borrowing capacity to fund any shortfall. Combined Company Post Denbury/Encore Merger Assuming the successful completion of the Encore acquisition in early March 2010, our currently planned 2010 capital expenditure budget for the combined companies would increase to $1 billion. Currently, this incremental $350 million of capital expenditures is budgeted to be spent as follows: (1) approximately $142 million to drill or participate in drilling or refracing of 55 to 75 wells in the Bakken area of North Dakota; (2) approximately $99 million to drill and complete 6 to 8 operated wells and participate in 20 to 25 non operated wells in the Haynesville and other East Texas fields; (3) approximately $35 million on Encores Rocky Mountain legacy oil fields; and (4) approximately $74 million on drilling and completion activities in Encores Permian Basin and Mid Continent region. Based on oil and gas commodity prices as of late February 2010 and our current estimated production forecasts on a combined basis for all of 2010, and before any asset sales, our 2010 combined capital budget is expected to be $150 million to $250 million greater than our anticipated combined cash flow from operations, assuming a full year of operations. 43 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations As discussed above in Overview Definitive Merger Agreement to Acquire Encore Acquisition Company, the primary source of cash for the proposed acquisition of Encore would be a new $1.6 billion bank credit facility, which would replace our existing facility, and $1 billion of recently issued 8.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020. We structured the financing of the acquisition to provide $600 million to $700 million of availability on our new $1.6 billion bank credit facility upon closing the transaction; this would provide a level of liquidity similar to that available to us prior to the transaction, and a portion of those funds would be available for the expanded capital expenditures discussed above. In addition, during 2010 we plan to sell between $500 million and $1 billion of oil and gas properties to cover capital expenditures in excess of cash flow from operations during 2010, to reduce debt levels, and to provide additional liquidity. During 2009, we also entered into oil and natural gas commodity derivative contracts through 2011 in order to protect our future cash flows. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding pricing and volumes for these commodity derivative contracts. We continually monitor our capital spending and anticipated cash flows and believe that we can adjust our capital spending up or down depending on cash flows; however, any such reduction in capital spending could reduce our anticipated production levels in future years. For 2010, we have contracted for certain capital expenditures, including construction of most of the Green Pipeline already in progress and two drilling rigs, and therefore we cannot eliminate all of our capital commitments without penalties (refer to Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Commitments and Obligations for further information regarding these commitments). As part of our semi annual bank review, on October 1, 2009, our bank borrowing base and commitment amounts were left unchanged at $900 million and $750 million, respectively. The borrowing base represents the amount that can be borrowed from a credit standpoint while the commitment amount is the amount the banks have committed to fund pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement. As a result of the sale of our remaining Barnett Shale properties in December 2009, the banks performed another redetermination of our borrowing base and left the commitment amount unchanged at $750 million. If for some reason the Merger is not completed, we anticipate this credit line will be sufficient for our 2010 plans, and do not expect our bank credit line to be reduced by our banks unless commodity prices were to decrease significantly from current levels. However, assuming the closing of the Merger, this credit facility will be replaced with the newly committed $1.6 billion four year revolving credit facility discussed above in Overview Definitive Merger Agreement to Acquire Encore Acquisition Company. Capital Expenditure Summary. The following table of capital expenditures includes accrued capital for each period. Our cash expenditures were $76.0 million higher in the 2009 period, $59.2 million lower in the 2008 period and $0.4 million higher in the 2007 period than the amounts listed below due to the increase (decrease) in our capital accruals in those periods. For the 2009 period, oil and natural gas property acquisitions include $168.7 million of Denbury common stock issued in the purchase of Conroe Field, representing 11,620,000 common shares valued at the closing stock price of $14.52 per share on the date of acquisition, and approximately $169.5 million of the combined acquisition cost of Hastings Field and Conroe Field which was assigned to goodwill as determined under the FASC Business Combinations topic. 44 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

Our 2008 capital expenditures were funded with $774.5 million of cash flow from operations, $225 million from the drop down of CO2 pipelines to Genesis, and $51.7 million from property sales proceeds. Our 2007 capital expenditures were funded with $570.2 million of cash flow from operations, $150.0 million from the April 2007 issuance of subordinated debt, $135.8 million from property sales proceeds, and $16.0 million of net bank borrowings. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Commitments and Obligations. At December 31, 2009, our dollar denominated payment obligations that are not on our balance sheet include our operating leases, which at year end 2009 totaled $162.2 million (including $147.8 million of original equipment costs) relating primarily to the lease financing of certain equipment for CO2 recycling facilities at our tertiary oil fields. We also have several leases relating to office space and other minor equipment leases. At December 31, 2009, we had a total of $10.5 million of letters of credit outstanding under our bank credit agreement. Additionally, we have dollar denominated obligations that are not currently recorded on our balance sheet relating to various obligations for development and exploratory expenditures that arise from our normal capital expenditure program or from other transactions common to our industry. In addition, in order to recover our undeveloped proved reserves, we must also fund the associated future development costs forecasted in our proved reserve reports. For a further discussion of our future development costs and proved reserves, see the table of our contractual obligations below. On February 2, 2009, we closed our $201 million purchase of Hastings Field. Under the agreement, we are required to make aggregate cumulative capital expenditures in this field of approximately $179 million over the next five years cumulating as follows: $26.8 million by December 31, 2010, $71.5 million by December 31, 2011, $107.2 million by December 31, 2012, $142.9 million by December 31, 2013, and $178.7 million by December 31, 2014. If we fail to spend the required amounts by the due dates, we are required to make a cash payment equal to 10% of the cumulative shortfall at each applicable date. During 2009, we made capital expenditures related to CO2 45 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations flood development at Hastings totaling $1.7 million. Further, we are committed to injecting at least an average of 50 MMcf/d of CO2 (total of purchased and recycled) in the West Hastings Unit for the 90 day period prior to January 1, 2013. If such injections do not occur, we must either (1) relinquish our rights to initiate (or continue) tertiary operations and reassign to Venoco all assets previously purchased for the value of such assets at that time based upon the discounted value of the fields proved reserves using a 20% discount rate, or (2) make an additional payment of $20 million in January 2013, less any payments made for failure to meet the capital spending requirements as of December 31, 2012, and a $30 million payment for each subsequent year (less amounts paid for capital expenditure shortfalls) until the CO2 injection rate in the Hastings Field equals or exceeds the minimum required injection rate. We currently anticipate that we will be able to meet the requirements under this agreement. We currently have long term commitments to purchase CO2 from eight proposed gasification plants; four are in the Gulf Coast region and four are in the Midwest region (Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky). The Midwest plants are not only conditioned on the specific plants being constructed, but also upon Denbury contracting additional volumes of CO2 for purchase in the general area of the proposed plants that would provide an acceptable economic rate of return on the CO2 pipeline. If all of these plants were to be built, these CO2 sources are currently anticipated to provide us with aggregate CO2 volumes of 1.2 Bcf/d to 1.9 Bcf/d. Due to the current economic conditions, the earliest we would expect any plant to be completed and providing CO2 would be 2014, and there is some doubt as to whether they will be constructed at all. Several of these plants are seeking funds from government sources, which if achieved, could increase the probability that the plants are ultimately constructed. The base price of CO2 per Mcf from these CO2 sources varies by plant and location, but is generally higher than our most recent all in cost of CO2 from our natural source (Jackson Dome) using current oil prices. Prices for CO2 delivered from these projects are expected to be competitive with the cost of our natural CO2 after adjusting for our estimates of future prices for our share of potential carbon emissions reduction credits. If all eight plants are built, the aggregate purchase obligation for this CO2 would be around $280 million per year, assuming a $70 per barrel oil price, before any potential savings from our share of carbon emissions reduction credits. All of the contracts have price adjustments that fluctuate based on the price of oil. Construction has not yet commenced on any of these plants, and their construction is contingent on the satisfactory resolution of various issues, including financing. While it is likely that not every plant currently under contract will be constructed, there are several other plants under consideration that could provide CO2 to us that would either supplement or replace some of the CO2 volumes from the eight proposed plants for which we currently have CO2 purchase contracts. We are having ongoing discussions with several of these other potential sources. As discussed above under Overview Definitive Merger Agreement to Acquire Encore Acquisition Company, the Encore Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Denbury and Encore, including, among others, if the Merger is not completed by May 31, 2010. In the event of a termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, Encore may be required to pay Denbury a termination fee of either $60 million or $120 million, or Denbury may be required to pay Encore a termination fee of either $60 million, $120 million or $300 million, in each case depending on the circumstances of the termination. In addition, fee letters executed in connection with the financing commitment from JP Morgan require Denbury to pay up to approximately $48 million in fees if the Merger is not consummated and the loans do not close. A summary of our obligations at December 31, 2009, is presented in the following table. Contingent termination fees in connection with the Merger are discussed above. This table does not include the $1 billion of 8.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 issued in February 2010, the $1.6 billion newly committed bank revolving credit agreement, or any contractual obligations of Encore. 46 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

This table assumes that our long term debt is held until maturity. (b) Represents the minimum estimated fees payable to JP Morgan for financing commitments related to the proposed acquisition of Encore if the Encore Merger does not close. If the Merger closes, these fees would be increased to approximately $95 million. (c) Represents estimated future cash payments under a long term transportation service agreement for the Free State Pipeline, and future minimum cash payments in a 20 year financing lease for the NEJD pipeline system. Both transactions with Genesis were entered into in 2008 and are being accounted for as financing leases. The payment required for the Free State Pipeline is variable based upon the amount of the CO2 we ship through the pipeline and the commitment amounts disclosed above for that financing lease are computed based upon our internal forecasts. Approximately $308 million of these payments represent interest. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Represents future minimum cash commitments of $4.7 million to Genesis under capital leases in place at December 31, 2009, primarily for transportation of crude oil and CO2, and $2.6 million for office space and rental equipment. Approximately $1.4 million of these payments represents interest. (e) Represents future cash commitments under contracts in place as of December 31, 2009, primarily for pipe, pipeline construction contracts, drilling rig services and well related costs. As is common in our industry, we commit to make certain expenditures on a regular basis as part of our ongoing development and exploration program. These commitments generally relate to projects that occur during the subsequent several months and are usually part of our normal operating expenses or part of our capital budget, which for 2010 is currently set at $650 million, exclusive of acquisitions and capitalized interest. In certain cases we have the ability to terminate contracts for equipment in which case we would only be liable for the cost incurred by the vendor up to that point; however, as we currently do not anticipate cancelling those contracts these amounts include our estimated payments under those contracts. We also have recurring expenditures for such things as accounting, engineering and legal fees, software maintenance, subscriptions, and other overhead type items. Normally these expenditures do not change materially on an aggregate basis from year to year and are part of our general and administrative expenses. We have not attempted to estimate the amounts of these types of recurring expenditures in this table as most could be quickly cancelled with regard to any specific vendor, even though the expense itself may be required for ongoing normal operations of the Company. (f) Represents the estimated future payments under our oil and natural gas derivative contracts based on the futures market prices as of December 31, 2009. These amounts will change as oil and natural gas commodity prices change. The estimated fair market value of our oil and natural gas commodity derivatives at December 31, 2009 was a $128.7 million net liability. See further discussion of our derivative contracts and their market price sensitivities in Market Risk Management below in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (g) Represents projected capital costs as scheduled in our December 31, 2009 proved reserve report that are necessary in order to recover our proved oil and natural gas reserves. These are not contractual commitments and are net of any other capital obligations shown under Contractual Obligations in the table above. (h) Represents projected capital costs as scheduled in our December 31, 2009 proved reserve report that are necessary in order to recover our proved CO2 reserves from our CO2 source wells used to produce CO2 for our tertiary operations. These are not contractual commitments and are net of any other capital obligations shown above. (i) Represents the estimated future asset retirement obligations on an undiscounted basis. The present discounted asset retirement obligation is $54.3 million, as determined under the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations topic of the FASC, and is further discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long term contracts require us to deliver CO2 to our industrial CO2 customers at various contracted prices, plus we have a CO2 delivery obligation to Genesis pursuant to three volumetric production payments (VPPs) (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Based upon the maximum amounts deliverable as stated in the industrial contracts and the volumetric production payments, we estimate that we may be obligated to deliver up to 433 Bcf of CO2 to these customers over the next 18 years; however, since the group as a whole has historically taken less CO2 than the maximum allowed in their contracts, based on the current level of deliveries, we project that our commitment would likely be reduced to approximately 165 Bcf. The maximum volume required in any given year 47 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is approximately 136 MMcf/d, although based on our current level of deliveries this would likely be reduced to approximately 66 MMcf/d. Given the size of our proved CO2 reserves at December 31, 2009 (approximately 6.3 Tcf before deducting approximately 127.1 Bcf for the three VPPs), our current production capabilities and our projected levels of CO2 usage for our own tertiary flooding program, we believe that we will be able to meet these delivery obligations. Results of Operations CO2 Operations Overview. Since we acquired our first carbon dioxide tertiary flood in Mississippi in 1999, we have gradually increased our emphasis on these types of operations. During this time, we have learned a considerable amount about tertiary operations and working with carbon dioxide. Our tertiary operations have grown to the point that approximately 65% of our December 31, 2009 proved reserves are proved tertiary oil reserves, almost 65% of our forecasted 2010 production is expected to come from tertiary oil operations (on a BOE basis), and almost all of our 2010 capital expenditures are related to our current or future tertiary operations. We particularly like this play as (i) it has a lower risk as we are working with oil fields that have significant historical production and data, (ii) it provides a reasonable rate of return at relatively low oil prices (we estimate our economic break even before corporate overhead and expenses on these projects at current oil prices is in the range of the mid thirties, depending on the specific field and area), and (iii) we have virtually no competition for this type of activity in our geographic area. Generally, from East Texas to Florida, there are no known significant natural sources of CO2 in the Gulf Coast area except our own, and these large volumes of CO2 that we own drive the play. In addition, we are pursuing anthropogenic (man made) sources of CO2 to use in our tertiary operations, which we believe will not only help us recover additional oil, but will provide an economical way to sequester CO2. We have acquired several old oil fields in our areas of operations with potential for tertiary recovery and plan to acquire additional fields, and we are continuing to expand our CO2 pipeline infrastructure to transport CO2. We talk about our tertiary operations by labeling operating areas or groups of fields as Phases. Phase 1 is in Southwest Mississippi and includes several fields along our 183 mile NEJD CO2 Pipeline that we acquired in 2001. The current tertiary fields in this area are Little Creek, Mallalieu, McComb, Brookhaven and Lockhart Crossing. Phase 2, which began with the early 2006 completion of the Free State CO2 Pipeline to East Mississippi, includes Eucutta, Soso, Martinville and Heidelberg Fields. Tinsley Field, which is located northwest of Jackson, Mississippi, and was acquired in January 2006, is our Phase 3 and is serviced by that portion of the Delta CO2 Pipeline completed in January 2008. Phase 4 includes Cranfield and Lake St. John Fields, two fields near the Mississippi/Louisiana border located west of the Phase I fields, and Phase 5 is Delhi Field, a Louisiana field we acquired in 2006, located southwest of Tinsley Field. Flooding in Phase 5 began in November 2009 upon completion of the Delta CO2 Pipeline from Tinsley to Delhi. Our first tertiary oil response from Delhi Field is expected near mid 2010. Citronelle Field in Southwest Alabama, another field acquired in 2006, is our Phase 6, which will require an extension to the Free State CO2 Pipeline or another pipeline depending on the ultimate CO2 source for this field, the timing of which is uncertain at this time. Our last three currently existing phases will require completion of our proposed Green Pipeline, a 320 mile CO2 pipeline that will run from Southern Louisiana to near Houston, Texas, and is scheduled for completion in 2010. Hastings Field, a field we purchased in February 2009 (see Commitments and Contingencies), is our Phase 7, the Seabreeze Complex, acquired in 2007, will be our Phase 8 and Conroe Field, a field we purchased in December 2009 (see Overview Conroe Field Acquisition) will be our Phase 9. We anticipate initiating CO2 injections at Oyster Bayou Field (Phase 8) mid 2010 and at Hastings Field (Phase 7) late 2010 or early 2011. CO2 Resources. Since we acquired the Jackson Dome CO2 source field located near Jackson, Mississippi, in 2001, we have continued to develop the field and have increased the proven CO2 reserves from approximately 800 Bcf at the time of the acquisition to approximately 6.3 Tcf as of December 31, 2009. During 2009, we drilled one additional CO2 source well, and we increased our CO2 reserves by approximately 1 Tcf, more than offsetting the 249 Bcf of CO2 produced during the year. The estimate of 6.3 Tcf of proved CO2 reserves is based on 100% ownership of the CO2 reserves, of which Denburys net revenue interest ownership is approximately 5.0 Tcf. Both reserve estimates are included in the evaluation of proven CO2 reserves prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton. In 48 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discussing the available CO2 reserves, we make reference to the gross amount of proved reserves, as this is the amount that is available for Denburys tertiary recovery programs, industrial users, and volumetric production payments with Genesis, as Denbury is responsible for distributing the entire CO2 production stream for all of these uses. We currently estimate that it will take approximately 2.2 Tcf of CO2 to develop and produce the proved tertiary recovery reserves we have recorded at December 31, 2009, in Phases 1 4. Today, we own every known producing CO2 well in the region, providing us a significant strategic advantage in the acquisition of other properties in Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas that could be further exploited through tertiary recovery. As of February 22, 2010, we estimate that we are capable of producing approximately 1 Bcf/d of CO2, approximately 9 times the rate that we were capable of producing at the time of our initial acquisition in 2001. We continue to drill additional CO2 wells, with three more wells planned for 2010 in order to further increase our proved CO2 reserves and production capacity. Our drilling activity at Jackson Dome will continue beyond 2010 as our current forecasts for the existing nine phases suggest that we will need approximately 1.4 Bcf/d of CO2 production by 2017. In addition to using CO2 for our tertiary operations, we sell CO2 to third party industrial users under long term contracts. Most of these industrial contracts have been sold to Genesis along with the sale of volumetric production payments for the CO2. Our average daily CO2 production during 2007, 2008 and 2009 was approximately 493 MMcf/d, 637 MMcf/d and 683 MMcf/d, respectively, of which approximately 81% in 2007, 86% in 2008 and 87% in 2009 was used in our tertiary recovery operations, with the balance delivered to Genesis under the volumetric production payments or sold to third party industrial users. During February 2010, our CO2 production averaged 800 MMcf/d. We spent approximately $0.17 per Mcf in operating expenses to produce our CO2 during 2009, less than our 2008 average of $0.22 per Mcf and our 2007 average of $0.21 per Mcf, with the decrease due primarily to decreased CO2 royalty expense as a result of lower oil prices. Our CO2 costs peaked at $0.27 per Mcf in the second quarter of 2008, corresponding to the peak in oil prices, but decreased during the fourth quarter of 2008 to an average of approximately $0.15 per Mcf as a result of the decline in oil prices. Our estimated total cost per thousand cubic feet of CO2 during 2009 was approximately $0.25 per Mcf, after inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense related to the CO2 production, as compared to approximately $0.30 per Mcf during 2008 and $0.29 per Mcf during 2007. During 2009, we announced that we had initiated a comprehensive feasibility study of a possible long term CO2 pipeline project that would connect proposed gasification plants in the Midwest to the Companys existing CO2 pipeline infrastructure in Mississippi or Louisiana. Two of the proposed plants are in the term sheet negotiation phase of a U.S. Department of Energy Loan Guarantee Program (see Off Balance Sheet Obligations Commitments and Obligations) which still require successful finalization of negotiations with the Department of Energy (DOE) to receive such guarantees. The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity provided financial assistance for the feasibility study for the Illinois portion of the pipeline. The feasibility study was undertaken to determine the most likely pipeline route, the estimated costs of constructing such a pipeline, and review regulatory, legal and permitting requirements. Our current preliminary estimates suggest this would be a 500 to 700 mile pipeline system with a preliminary cost estimate of approximately $1.0 billion, based on the cost of other pipelines we have recently built or have under construction. We have completed the initial feasibility study of this Midwest pipeline, and are evaluating market conditions, potential financing opportunities and construction of the proposed gasification projects. It is currently uncertain whether or not we will build such a pipeline, but this future decision will be highly dependent upon whether or not the proposed gasification plants will be constructed and the economic feasibility of the overall project. A third proposed gasification plant to be built along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, for which Denbury has a CO2 purchase contract, was also selected by the loan guarantee program. The Company plans to commence a pipeline study for this proposed plant, which would likely be a 110 mile pipeline that connects to the existing Free State Pipeline. In addition to our natural source of CO2 and the proposed gasification plants discussed above (see Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Commitments and Obligations), we continue to have ongoing discussions with owners of existing plants of various types that emit CO2 which we may be able to purchase. In order to capture such volumes, 49 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations we (or the plant owner) would need to install additional equipment, which includes at a minimum, compression and dehydration facilities. Most of these existing plants emit relatively small volumes of CO2, generally less than the proposed gasification plants, but such volumes may still be attractive if the source is located near our Green Pipeline. The capture of CO2 could also be influenced by potential federal legislation, which could impose economic penalties for the emission of CO2. We believe that we are a likely purchaser of CO2 produced in our area of operations because of the scale of our tertiary operations, our CO2 pipeline infrastructure, and our large natural source of CO2 (Jackson Dome), which can act as a swing CO2 source to balance CO2 supply and demand. Overview of Tertiary Economics. When we began our tertiary operations several years ago, they were generally economic at oil prices below $20 per Bbl, although the economics varied by field. Our costs have escalated during the last few years due to general cost inflation in the industry and higher oil prices, and we estimate that our current break even, before corporate overhead and interest, is in the mid thirties per barrel if oil prices remain at their current level (approximately $70 per barrel). Our inception to date finding and development costs (including future development and abandonment costs but excluding expenditures on fields without proven reserves) for our tertiary oil fields through December 31, 2009, are approximately $12.68 per BOE. Currently, we forecast that most of these costs will average less than $10 per BOE over the life of each field, depending on the state of a particular field at the time we begin operations, the amount of potential oil, the proximity to a pipeline or other facilities, and other factors. The finding and development costs to date do not include additional probable reserves in fields with current proved reserves. Our operating costs for tertiary operations are highly dependent on commodity prices and could range from $15 per BOE to $25 per BOE over the life of each field, again depending on the field itself. While these economic factors have wide ranges, our rate of return from these operations has generally been better than our rate of return on traditional oil and gas operations, and thus our tertiary operations have become our single most important focus area. While it is extremely difficult to accurately forecast future production, we do believe that our tertiary recovery operations provide significant long term production growth potential at reasonable rates of return, with relatively low risk, and thus will be the backbone of our Companys growth for the foreseeable future. Although we believe that our plans and projections are reasonable and achievable, there could be delays or unforeseen problems in the future that could delay or affect the economics of our overall tertiary development program. We believe that such delays or price effects, if any, should only be temporary. Financial Statement Impact of CO2 Operations. Our increasing emphasis on CO2 tertiary recovery projects has significantly impacted, and will continue to impact, our financial results and certain operating statistics. First, there is a significant delay between the initial capital expenditures on these fields and the resulting production increases, as we must build facilities, and often a CO2 pipeline to the field before CO2 flooding can commence, and it usually takes six to 12 months before the field responds to the injection of CO2 (i.e., oil production commences). Further, we may spend significant amounts of capital before we can recognize any proven reserves from fields we flood (see Analysis of CO2 Tertiary Recovery Operating Activities below). Even after a field has proven reserves, there will usually be significant amounts of additional capital required to fully develop the field. Second, tertiary projects may be more expensive to operate than other oil fields because of the cost of injecting and recycling the CO2 (primarily due to the significant energy requirements to re compress the CO2 back into a near liquid state for re injection purposes). Since a significant portion of our operating costs vary along with commodity and electrical prices, these costs are highly variable and will increase in a high commodity price environment and decrease in a low price environment. As an example (as discussed above), during 2009 the cost of our CO2 varied from $0.13 per Mcf to $0.21 per Mcf. Most of our CO2 operating costs are allocated to our tertiary oil fields and recorded as lease operating expenses (following the commencement of tertiary oil production) at the time the CO2 is injected, and these costs have historically represented over 25% of the total operating costs for a tertiary operation. Since we expense all of the operating costs to produce and inject our CO2 (following the commencement of tertiary oil production), the operating costs per barrel will be higher at the inception of CO2 injection projects because of minimal related oil production at that time. Analysis of CO2 Tertiary Recovery Operating Activities. We currently have tertiary operations ongoing at all Phase 1 fields, at Soso, Martinville, Eucutta and Heidelberg Fields in Phase 2, Tinsley Field in Phase 3, Cranfield Field in Phase 4 and Delhi Field in Phase 5. We project that our oil production from our CO2 operations will increase substantially over the next several years as we continue to expand this program by adding additional projects and 50 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations phases. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 134.5 MMBbls of proved oil reserves related to tertiary operations (45.2 MMBbls in Phase 1, 44.6 MMBbls in Phase 2, 33.9 MMBbls in Phase 3 and 10.8 MMBbls in Phase 4) representing about 65% of our total corporate proved reserves, and have identified and estimate significant additional oil potential in other fields that we own in this region. We added 17.6 MMBbls of tertiary related proved oil reserves during 2009, primarily initial proven tertiary oil reserves at Cranfield Field in Phase 4, plus additional reserves at Tinsley, Heidelberg and Eucutta Fields. In order to recognize proved tertiary oil reserves, we must either have an oil production response to the CO2 injections or the field must be analogous to an existing tertiary flood. The magnitude of proven reserves that we can book in any given year will depend on our progress with new floods and the timing of the production response. Our average annual oil production from our CO2 tertiary recovery activities has increased during the last few years, from 3,970 Bbls/d in 2002 to 24,343 Bbls/d during 2009 (26,307 Bbls/d during the fourth quarter of 2009). Tertiary oil production represented approximately 66% of our total corporate oil production during 2009 and approximately 50% of our total corporate production of both oil and natural gas during the same period on a BOE basis. We expect that this tertiary related oil production will continue to increase, although the increases are not always predictable or consistent. While we may have temporary fluctuation in oil production related to tertiary operations, this usually does not indicate any issue with the proved and potential oil reserves recoverable with CO2, because the historical correlation between oil production and CO2 injections remains high. A detailed discussion of each of our tertiary oil fields and the development of each is included on pages 11 14 under Our Tertiary Oil Fields with Proved Tertiary Reserves. Following is a chart with our tertiary oil production by field for 2007, 2008 and 2009, and by quarter for 2009.

Tertiary oil production during the fourth quarter of 2009 averaged 26,307 Bbls/d, a 20% increase over the fourth quarter 2008 levels, and an 8% sequential increase from third quarter 2009 levels. These year over year increases are the result of production growth in response to continued expansion of the tertiary floods in our Tinsley, Soso, Eucutta and Brookhaven Fields, and to initial 51 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations production response from Cranfield and Heidelberg Fields. We had our first production response from Cranfield Field during the first quarter of 2009 and our first response from Heidelberg Field in the second quarter of 2009, a little earlier than anticipated. Tinsley field has been one of our top performing tertiary oil fields, and production there is expected to increase as we continue to expand the flood. The declines at Mallalieu Field during the second and third quarters of 2009 were partially due to CO2 recycle volumes exceeding the plant capacity, which limited production volumes. We have expanded the capacity of the facility, which expansion capacity became operational early in the fourth quarter of 2009. Although we received an initial increase in production following completion of the facility, we anticipate that production at Mallalieu Field will begin to decline again in the near future. The Delhi pipeline is complete, and we initiated CO2 injections at Delhi Field (Phase 5) during November 2009. We currently anticipate tertiary production response at Delhi Field around mid year 2010. During 2009, operating costs for our tertiary properties averaged $21.67 per Bbl, lower than the prior years average of $23.57 per Bbl. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the operating costs on our tertiary properties averaged $22.03 per Bbl as compared to $21.86 per Bbl in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $23.14 per Bbl during the third quarter of 2009. Our per barrel costs in 2009 are lower than in 2008 due primarily to the reduced cost of CO2 in the current year period. On a per barrel basis, our cost of CO2 decreased by $1.99 per Bbl, from $5.95 per Bbl in 2008 to $3.96 per Bbl in 2009, primarily due to the reduction in oil prices to which our CO2 costs are partially tied. Our single highest cost for our tertiary operations is our cost for fuel and utilities, which averaged $5.76 per Bbl in 2009, $5.39 per Bbl in 2008 and $4.71 per Bbl in 2007, which has increased on a per barrel basis due to continued expansion of our tertiary floods. For any specific field, we expect our tertiary lease operating expense per BOE to be high initially, then decrease as production increases, ultimately leveling off until production begins to decline in the latter life of the field, when lease operating expense per BOE will again increase. Through December 31, 2009, we have invested a total of $1.8 billion in tertiary fields (including allocated acquisition costs and amounts assigned to Goodwill) and have only $225.7 million in unrecovered net cash flow (revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures). Of this total invested amount, approximately $487.4 million (27%) was spent on fields which have yet to have appreciable proved reserves at December 31, 2009 (i.e., fields for which significant incremental proved reserves are anticipated during 2010 and beyond). The proved oil reserves in our CO2 fields have a PV 10 Value of $2.3 billion, using the calendar 2009 first day of the month 12 month unweighted average NYMEX pricing of $61.18 per Bbl. These amounts do not include the capital costs or related depreciation and amortization of our CO2 producing properties, but do include CO2 source field lease operating costs and transportation costs. CO2 Source Field and Tertiary Oil Field Related Capital Budget for 2010. Our current capital spending plans for 2010 include approximately $74 million to be spent in the Jackson Dome area with the intent to add CO2 reserves and deliverability for future operations, approximately $365 million to be spent in development of our tertiary floods, and approximately $159 million to be spent for our CO2 pipelines, making our combined CO2 related expenditures over 90% of our $650 million 2010 capital budget. Operating Results As summarized in the Overview section above, and discussed in further detail below, our operating results increased from 2007 to 2008, but decreased from 2008 to 2009. The primary factors impacting our operating results were fluctuating commodity prices, changes in the fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts, and increases and decreases in production, which are all explained in more detail below. Certain of our operating results and statistics for each of the last three years are included in the following table. 52 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

The increase from 2008 to 2009 is due primarily to a 26% increase in tertiary oil production and to the acquisition of Hastings Field, partially offset by the sale of our Barnett Shale properties and to decreases in our Mississippi non CO2 floods. Excluding production from the Barnett Shale properties sold during 2009, production would have averaged 38,760 BOE/d during 2009 and 33,643 BOE/d during 2008, a 15% increase year to year. Our production increase between 2007 and 2008 was due to a 31% increase in tertiary oil production and production increases in the Barnett Shale, partially offset by the sale of our Louisiana natural gas properties and declines in our Mississippi non CO2 floods. The increase in our tertiary oil production is discussed above under Results of Operations CO2 Operations. The acquisition of Hastings Field in February 2009 added 1,956 BOE/d during 2009 to our Texas area production. As discussed previously, we sold 60% of our interests in the Barnett Shale during June and July 2009, and sold our remaining 40% interest in these properties during December 2009. Production in the Mississippi non tertiary operations decreased each of the last two years. Production in this area decreased 5% from 2007 to 2008, and further decreased 16% from 2008 to 2009. Most of this decrease is due to the expected gradual decline in Heidelberg Field due to depletion, although to a greater extent in 2009 due to the development of the Heidelberg CO2 flood, which resulted in production being shut in while portions of the field were converted to tertiary operations. When production commences from these CO2 floods, these volumes are reported as tertiary production for Heidelberg Field. Also, production is lower in 2009 due to no drilling activity in the Selma Chalk. Our drilling activity in Sharon Field (natural gas) in the latter part of 2008 helped offset the declines in the first quarter of 2009, but production there has declined each of the last three quarters of 2009, as we did not drill any additional wells in 2009. Our production during 2009 was 77% oil as compared to 68% during 2008 and 63% during 2007. This increase is due to the sale of our Louisiana natural gas assets during December 2007 and February 2008, the sale of our Barnett Shale properties during 2009, the acquisition of Hastings Field during February 2009, and to the increase in our tertiary operations each year. Pro forma for the sale of the Barnett assets and the Conroe acquisition, fourth quarter 2009 production would have been 91% oil. Oil and Natural Gas Revenues: Fluctuating commodity prices resulted in an increase in our oil and natural gas revenues between 2007 and 2008, but a decline between 2008 and 2009. Our increasing production added to the revenue increase between 2007 and 2008, and partially offset the revenue decrease from commodity prices between 2008 and 2009. These changes in revenues, excluding any impact of our derivative contracts, are reflected in the following table. 54 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

Likewise, our oil NYMEX differential widened during 2008 as compared to 2007, due to the overall increase in oil prices, with a peak in our differential during the second quarter of 2008, corresponding with the peak in oil prices. Our oil NYMEX differential was also positively impacted during 2009 due to reduced natural gas liquids production as a result of the sale of our Barnett Shale properties, which historically have a significantly higher differential to NYMEX Our natural gas NYMEX differentials are generally caused by movement in the NYMEX natural gas prices during the month, as most of our natural gas is sold on an index price that is set near the first of each month. While the percentage change in NYMEX natural gas differentials can be quite large, these differentials are very seldom more than a dollar above or below NYMEX prices. Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Contracts: The following table summarizes the impact our oil and natural gas derivative contracts had on our operating results for 2009, 2008 and 2007. 55 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

Because we do not utilize hedge accounting for our commodity derivative contracts, the changes in fair value of these contracts, as outlined above, are recognized currently in our income statement. Production Expenses: Our lease operating expenses have increased each year on both a per BOE basis and in absolute dollars primarily as a result of (i) our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations and additional tertiary fields moving into the productive phase (see discussion of those expenses under CO2 Operations above), (ii) the acquisition of Hastings Field in February 2009, which has a higher operating cost per BOE than most of our other properties, (iii) increased personnel and related costs, (iv) higher electrical costs to operate our properties due primarily to the expansion of our tertiary operations, (v) increasing lease payments due to incremental leasing of certain equipment in our tertiary operating facilities, and (vi) on a per BOE basis for 2009, the mid year sale of our Barnett Shale natural gas properties, as these properties had a lower per unit operating cost. Company wide lease operating expense per BOE averaged $18.50 per BOE, $18.13 per BOE and $14.34 per BOE during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. On a pro forma basis, after adjusting our operating results to remove the Barnett Shale production and operating expenses, Company wide lease operating expenses would have been $21.94 per BOE during 2009, $23.02 per BOE during 2008 and $17.07 per BOE during 2007. Our tertiary operating costs, which have historically been higher than our company wide operating costs, averaged $21.67 per BOE during 2009, $23.57 per BOE during 2008 and $19.77 per BOE during 2007 (see Results of Operations CO2 Operations for a more detailed discussion). As our tertiary operations become a larger percentage of our total operations, we expect that our operating costs on a per BOE basis will become closer to our tertiary operating costs, or higher as much of our conventional oil production, which is in decline, is at a higher per barrel cost than our tertiary operations. Costs of electricity and utilities to operate our properties have increased due primarily to the expansion of our tertiary operations. We expect our tertiary operating costs to partially correlate with oil prices, as the price we pay for CO2 is partially tied to oil prices. 56 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Production taxes and marketing expenses generally change in proportion to commodity prices and production volumes, and as such, decreased 33% between 2008 and 2009, correlating with the 36% decrease in total revenues between the two years and increased between 2007 and 2008 as a result of higher commodity prices. Transportation and plant processing fees were approximately $3.6 million lower in 2009 than 2008 primarily due to the sale of Barnett Shale properties in mid 2009, and were $8.4 million higher in 2008 than 2007 due to incremental Barnett Shale production and plant processing fees in 2008. General and Administrative Expenses During the last three years, general and administrative (GA) expenses have increased on both a gross basis and on a per BOE basis as outlined in the following table: Year Ended December 31, In thousands, except per BOE data and employees 2009 2008 2007 Gross cash GA expense $ 143,886 $ 121,209 $ 103,334 Employee stock based compensation 24,322 16,243 12,185 Founders retirement 10,000 Incentive compensation for Genesis management 14,212 Acquisition expenses 8,921 527 State franchise taxes 4,703 3,415 2,915 Operator labor and overhead recovery charges (76,044 ) (68,556 ) (59,145 ) Capitalized exploration and development costs (13,905 ) (12,464 ) (10,317 ) Net GA expense $ 116,095 $ 60,374 $ 48,972 GA per BOE: Net cash GA expense $ 3.27 $ 2.58 $ 2.30 Net stock based compensation 1.16 0.75 0.56 Founders retirement 0.57 Incentive compensation for Genesis management 0.81 Acquisition expenses 0.51 0.03 State franchise tax 0.27 0.20 0.18 Net GA expense $ 6.59 $ 3.56 $ 3.04 Employees as of December 31 830 797 686 Gross cash GA expenses increased $22.7 million, or 19% between 2008 and 2009, and $17.9 million, or 17%, between 2007 and 2008. The increases are primarily due to higher compensation and personnel related costs caused by an increase in the number of employees and higher wages, which we consider necessary in order to remain competitive in our industry. During 2008, we increased our employee count by 16%, and we further increased our employee count 4% during 2009, although our employee count was higher for part of 2009 before the sale of a portion of our Barnett Shale properties in mid 2009. Stock compensation expense reflected in gross GA was $24.3 million during 2009, $16.2 million during 2008 and $12.2 million during 2007, due primarily to the increase in employees and changes in the mix of compensation awarded to employees. As discussed above in Overview Mid Year Management Changes, we also expensed $10.0 million in the second quarter of 2009 related to a Founders Retirement Agreement for Gareth Roberts, as he retired as CEO and President of the Company on June 30, 2009. Also adding to the increase in net GA expense for 2009 was a charge relating to incentive compensation awards for the management of Genesis of $14.2 million. As incentive compensation for Genesis management, our former subsidiary which is the general partner of Genesis Energy, LP, awarded management the right to earn an interest in the incentive distributions we receive. These awards were subject to vesting over four years and achieving future levels of cash available before reserves on a per unit basis, among other conditions. As discussed above under Overview Sale of Interests in General Partner of Genesis Energy, L.P., Denbury sold its interest in the general partner of Genesis on February 5, 2010. As such, the change in 57 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations control provision of each members compensation agreement was triggered and the awards were settled for $14.9 million in cash in February 2010. See also Note 15, Subsequent Events to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these incentive compensation awards and the sale of our interest in the Genesis general partner. In addition to the increased compensation and other personnel related costs discussed above, an $8.4 million increase in acquisition related expenses also contributed to the increase in net GA expense between 2008 and 2009. FASC Business Combinations topic requires that all transaction related costs (legal, accounting, due diligence, etc.) be expensed as incurred. As such, Denbury has recognized a total of $8.9 million of GA expense in 2009 related primarily to transaction costs associated with the Encore acquisition. The increase in gross GA expense in each of the last three years was offset in part by an increase in operator overhead recovery charges. Our well operating agreements allow us, when we are the operator, to charge a well with a specified overhead rate during the drilling phase and also to charge a monthly fixed overhead rate for each producing well. As a result of additional operated wells from acquisitions, additional tertiary operations, drilling activity during the past year, and increased compensation expense, the amount we recovered as operator labor and overhead charges increased by 11% between 2008 and 2009, and 16% between 2007 and 2008. Capitalized exploration and development costs also increased each year, primarily due to additional personnel and increased compensation costs. The net effect of the increases in gross GA expenses, operator overhead recoveries and capitalized exploration costs was a 92% increase in net GA expense between 2008 and 2009, and a 23% increase in net GA expense between 2007 and 2008. On a per BOE basis, net GA expense also increased each year, but at a lower percentage rate due to increased production, with an 85% increase in GA per BOE in 2009 as compared 2008, and a 17% increase in 2008 as compared to 2007. Interest and Financing Expenses Year Ended December 31, In thousands, except per BOE data and interest rates 2009 2008 2007 Cash interest expense $ 108,629 $ 59,955 $ 49,205 Non cash interest expense 7,397 1,802 2,010 Less: Capitalized interest (68,596 ) (29,161 ) (20,385 ) Interest expense $ 47,430 $ 32,596 $ 30,830 Interest income and other $ 2,362 $ 4,834 $ 6,642 Net cash interest expense and other income per BOE (1) $ 2.14 $ 1.59 $ 1.43 Average debt outstanding $ 1,265,142 $ 735,288 $ 672,376 Average interest rate (2) 8.6 % 8.2 % 7.3 % (1) Cash interest expense less capitalized interest less interest and other income on BOE basis. (2) Includes commitment fees but excludes debt issue costs and amortization of discount and premium. Interest expense increased $14.8 million, or 46%, between 2009 and 2008 and $1.8 million, or 6%, between 2007 and 2008. The increase in interest expense between 2008 and 2009 is due primarily to the February 2009 issuance of $420 million of 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016, and to a full year of interest expense recognized during 2009 on the pipeline dropdown transactions with Genesis, as compared to only seven months of interest recognized on the dropdowns during 2008. This increase in interest expense between 2008 and 2009 was largely offset by a $39.4 million increase in capitalized interest, primarily relating to interest capitalized on our Green Pipeline currently under construction. The increase in interest expense between 2007 and 2008 was due primarily to the pipeline dropdown transactions with Genesis mid 2008, which were recorded as capital leases. The increase in our average debt outstanding in 2009 as compared to 2008 is due the issuance of $420 million Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016, the pipeline dropdown transactions with Genesis, and to increased bank borrowings, primarily to fund our acquisitions. 58 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

Our DDA rate for oil and natural gas properties on a per BOE basis increased slightly between 2008 and 2009 and increased approximately 5% between 2007 and 2008, due primarily to capital spending and increasing costs. Our proved reserves increased from 194.7 MMBOE as of December 31, 2007, to 250.5 MMBOE as of December 31, 2008, and decreased to 207.5 MMBOE as of December 31, 2009, due primarily to the sale of our Barnett Shale properties during 2009. During 2009, we added approximately 48.8 MMBOE of proved reserves (before netting out 2009 production and property sales). The most significant additions were approximately 17.6 MMBOE related to our tertiary operations, 18.4 MMBOE related to the acquisition of Conroe Field, and 9.6 MMBOE related to the acquisition of Hastings Field. In the second quarter of 2009, we booked approximately 10.9 million barrels of incremental oil reserves related to our tertiary operations at Cranfield Field, as a result of the oil production response to the CO2 injections in that field. Correspondingly, we moved approximately $82.4 million from unevaluated properties to the full cost pool relating to Cranfield Field, representing the acquisition costs and development expenditures incurred on the field prior to recognizing proved reserves Our DDA rate for our CO2 and other fixed assets increased approximately 16% between 2008 and 2009, as a result of the Heidelberg CO2 pipeline being placed into service during 2008, expansion of our corporate offices during 2008, and field office expansion during 2009. At December 31, 2009, we had $779.1 million of costs related to CO2 pipelines under construction. These costs were not being depreciated at December 31, 2009. Depreciation of these pipelines will commence as each segment of pipeline is placed into service. Our DDA rate for our CO2 and other fixed assets increased in 2008 as compared to 2007, due primarily to the Heidelberg CO2 pipeline being placed into service during 2008, drilling costs for additional CO2 wells, and the expansion of our corporate office space in 2008. As part of the requirements of the FASB guidance under the Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations topic of the FASC, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred, discounted to its present value using our credit adjusted risk free interest rate, with a corresponding capitalized amount. The liability is accreted each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. On an undiscounted basis, we estimated our retirement obligations at December 31, 2007 to be $100.6 million ($41.3 million present value), with an estimated salvage value of $67.3 million, and as of December 31, 2008, we estimated our retirement obligations to be $106.4 million ($45.1 million present value), with an estimated salvage value of $76.4 million, the increase related to 2008 activity and higher cost estimates due to the inflation in our industry, partially offset by a decrease in our obligation of approximately $9.5 million, ($9.3 million present value) related to the sale of most of our Louisiana natural gas properties in late 2007 and early 2008. As of December 31, 2009, we estimated our retirement obligations to be $134.5 million ($54.3 million present value), with 59 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations an estimated salvage value of $81.4 million. The increase in our asset retirement obligations during 2009 was due to the acquisition of the Hastings and Conroe Fields, partially offset by the disposition of our Barnett Shale assets. DDA is calculated on the increase in retirement obligations recorded as incremental oil and natural gas and CO2 properties, net of its estimated salvage value. We also include the accretion of discount on the asset retirement obligation in our DDA expense. Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation. As a result of depressed oil and natural gas prices at December 31, 2008, we recorded our first full cost ceiling test write down in a decade, resulting in expense of $226.0 million or $13.32 per BOE at December 31, 2008. The SEC adopted major revisions to its rules governing oil and gas company reporting requirements which were effective for us beginning on December 31, 2009. Under these new rules, the full cost ceiling value will be calculated using a 12 month average price based on the first day of every month during the period. We did not have a ceiling test write down December 31, 2009. However, if oil prices were to decrease significantly in subsequent periods, we may be required to record additional write downs under the full cost pool ceiling test in the future. The possibility and amount of any future write down is difficult to predict, and will depend upon oil and natural gas prices, the incremental proved reserves that may be added each period, revisions to previous estimates of reserves and future capital expenditures, and additional capital spent. Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, Amounts in thousands, except per BOE amounts and tax rates 2009 2008 2007 Current income tax expense $ 4,611 $ 40,812 $ 30,074 Deferred income tax expense (benefit) (51,644 ) 195,020 110,193 Total income tax expense (benefit) $ (47,033 ) $ 235,832 $ 140,267 Average income tax expense (benefit) per BOE $ (2.67 ) $ 13.90 $ 8.71 Effective tax rate 38.5 % 37.8 % 35.7 % Total net deferred tax liability $ (469,195 ) $ (522,234 ) $ (334,662 ) Our income tax provision for each of the last three years has been based on an estimated statutory rate of approximately 38%. Our effective tax rate has generally been slightly lower than our estimated statutory rate due to the impact of certain items such as our domestic production activities deduction, offset in part by compensation arising from certain equity compensation that cannot be deducted for tax purposes in the same manner as book expense. Our 2009 effective tax rate was slightly higher, however, as compared to our statutory rate due to the recognition of net tax benefits related to the sale of our Barnett Shale assets. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the current income tax expense represents our anticipated alternative minimum cash taxes that we cannot offset with enhanced oil recovery credits. As of December 31, 2009, we had an estimated $39 million of enhanced oil recovery credits to carry forward that can be utilized to reduce our current income taxes during 2010 or future years. These enhanced oil recovery credits do not begin to expire until 2024. Since the ability to earn additional enhanced oil recovery credits is based upon the level of oil prices, we would not currently expect to earn additional enhanced oil recovery credits unless oil prices were to decrease significantly from current levels. In the second quarter of 2008, we obtained approval from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to change our method of tax accounting for certain assets used in our tertiary oilfield recovery operations. Although the overall effects of this accounting change are under audit, we expect to receive tax refunds of approximately $10.6 million for tax years through 2007, along with other deferred tax benefits, and in the second quarter of 2008 we reduced our current income tax expense by approximately $19 million to adjust for the impact of this change through the first six months of 2008. The reduction in current income tax expense has been offset by a corresponding increase in deferred income tax expense of approximately the same amount. Although this change is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys overall tax rate, it is anticipated that it could defer the amount of cash taxes the Company might otherwise pay over the next several years. The current administration in Washington D.C. is attempting to remove many tax incentives for the oil and gas industry. Those items that would have the most significant impact on us would include the loss of the domestic manufacturing deduction as well as the repeal of the 60 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations immediate expensing of intangible drilling costs and tertiary injectant costs. It is uncertain whether or not the current administration will be successful in changing the laws, but if they were successful, it would likely increase the amount of cash taxes that we pay. Per BOE Data The following table summarizes our cash flow, DDA and results of operations on a per BOE basis for the comparative periods. Each of the individual components is discussed above. Year Ended December 31, Per BOE data 2009 2008 2007 Oil and natural gas revenues $ 49.16 $ 79.42 $ 59.17 Gain (loss) on settlements of derivative contracts 8.32 (3.40 ) 1.27 Lease operating expenses (18.50 ) (18.13 ) (14.34 ) Production taxes and marketing expenses (2.41 ) (3.76 ) (3.05 ) Production netback 36.57 54.13 43.05 Non tertiary CO2 operating margin 0.50 0.57 0.58 General and administrative expenses (6.59 ) (3.56 ) (3.04 ) Net cash interest expense and other income (2.14 ) (1.59 ) (1.43 ) Abandoned acquisition costs (1.80 ) Current income taxes and other 2.30 (1.78 ) (1.37 ) Changes in assets and liabilities relating to operations (0.54 ) (0.31 ) (2.38 ) Cash flow from operations 30.10 45.66 35.41 DDA (13.52 ) (13.08 ) (12.17 ) Write down of oil and natural gas properties (13.32 ) Deferred income taxes 2.93 (11.50 ) (6.84 ) Non cash commodity derivative adjustments (21.72 ) 15.19 (2.43 ) Changes in assets and liabilities and other non cash items (2.05 ) (0.05 ) 1.75 Net income (loss) $ (4.26 ) $ 22.90 $ 15.72 Market Risk Management Debt We finance some of our acquisitions and other expenditures with fixed and variable rate debt. These debt agreements expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We had $125 million of bank debt outstanding as of December 31, 2009. The carrying value of our bank debt is approximately fair value based on the fact that it is subject to short term floating interest rates that approximate the rates available to us for those periods. We adjusted the estimated fair value measurements of our bank debt at December 31, 2009, for estimated nonperformance risk. This estimated nonperformance risk totaled approximately $2.5 million and was determined utilizing industry credit default swaps. None of our existing debt has any triggers or covenants regarding our debt ratings with rating agencies, although under the NEJD financing lease with Genesis (see Note 3, Related Party Transactions Genesis to our Consolidated Balance Sheets) in the event of significant downgrades of our corporate credit rating by the rating agencies, Genesis can require certain credit enhancements from us, and possibly other remedies under the lease. The fair value of the subordinated debt is based on quoted market prices. The following table presents the carrying and fair values of our debt, along with average interest rates at December 31, 2009. 61 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. These contracts have consisted of price floors, collars and fixed price swaps. The production that we hedge has varied from year to year depending on our levels of debt and financial strength and expectation of future commodity prices. In early 2009, we began to employ a strategy to hedge a portion of our production looking out 12 to 15 months from each quarter, as we believe it is important to protect our future cash flow to provide a level of assurance for our capital spending in those future periods in light of current worldwide economic uncertainties. However, as a result of our plan to acquire Encore and the potentially higher debt levels necessary to finance that merger, we entered into costless collars in early November 2009, to hedge a significant portion of our production through 2011. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding our derivative contracts. All of the mark to market valuations used for our oil and natural gas derivatives are provided by external sources and are based on prices that are actively quoted. We manage and control market and counterparty credit risk through established internal control procedures that are reviewed on an ongoing basis. We attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies, monitoring procedures and diversification. All of our derivative contracts are with parties that are lenders under our Senior Bank Loan. We have included an estimate of nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts. We have measured nonperformance risk based upon credit default swaps or credit spreads. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts was reduced by $0.8 million and $3.7 million, respectively, for estimated nonperformance risk. For accounting purposes, we do not apply hedge accounting to our oil and natural gas derivative contracts. This means that any changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion to earnings. Information regarding our current derivative contract positions and results of our historical derivative activity is included in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2009, our derivative contracts were recorded at their fair value, which was a net liability of approximately $128.7 million, a significant change from the $249.7 million fair value asset recorded at December 31, 2008. This change is primarily related to the expiration of oil derivative contracts during 2009, and to the oil and natural gas futures prices as of December 31, 2009, in relation to the new commodity derivative contracts we entered into during 2009 for 2010 and 2011. Commodity Derivative Sensitivity Analysis Based on NYMEX crude oil and natural gas futures prices as of December 31, 2009, and assuming both a 10% increase and decrease thereon, we would expect to make or receive payments on our crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts as seen in the following table: 62 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Crude Oil Natural Gas Derivative Derivative Contracts Contracts Receipt/ Receipt/ In thousands (Payment) (Payment) Based on: NYMEX futures prices as of December 31, 2009 $ (85,193 ) $ (2,813 ) 10% increase in prices (148,189 ) (17,310 ) 10% decrease in prices (45,653 ) 11,692 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we select certain accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments regarding the application of those policies. Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements. Full Cost Method of Accounting, Depletion and Depreciation and Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Businesses involved in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. We apply the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Another acceptable method of accounting for oil and gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting. In general, the primary differences between the two methods are related to the capitalization of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment. Under the full cost method, all geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool, whereas under the successful efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred. In the assessment of impairment of oil and gas properties, the successful efforts method follows the FASB guidance under the, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets topic of the FASC, under which the net book value of assets is measured for impairment against the undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method, the full cost pool (net book value of oil and gas properties) is measured against future cash flows discounted at 10% using the average first day of the month oil and natural gas price for each month during the 12 month period ended as of each quarterly reporting period. The financial results for a given period could be substantially different depending on the method of accounting that an oil and gas entity applies. Further, we do not designate our oil and natural gas derivative contracts as hedge instruments for accounting purposes under the FASC hedge accounting topic, and as a result, these contracts are not considered in the full cost ceiling test. We make significant estimates at the end of each period related to accruals for oil and gas revenues, production, capitalized costs and operating expenses. We calculate these estimates with our best available data, which includes, among other things, production reports, price posting, information compiled from daily drilling reports and other internal tracking devices, and analysis of historical results and trends. While management is not aware of any required revisions to its estimates, there will likely be future adjustments resulting from such things as changes in ownership interests, payouts, joint venture audits, re allocations by the purchaser/pipeline, or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and natural gas industry, many of which will require retroactive application. These types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated or determined and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs. Under full cost accounting, the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom used to perform the full cost ceiling test have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to 63 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible, including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare the report, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statement disclosures. Over the last four years, Denburys annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately 1.9% of the previous years estimates and have been both positive and negative. Changes in commodity prices also affect our reserve quantities. Between 2006 and 2007, the change to reserve quantities related to commodity prices was relatively small as prices were relatively high each year end; however, at December 31, 2008, the lower commodity prices lowered our proved reserves by 13.8 MMBOE. Between 2008 and 2009, commodity prices increased, resulting in an increase in our proved reserves of 4.2 MMBOE. These changes in quantities affect our DDA rate, and the combined effect of changes in quantities and commodity prices impacts our full cost ceiling test calculation. For example, we estimate that a 5% increase in our estimate of proved reserves quantities would have lowered our fourth quarter 2009 DDA rate from $14.77 per BOE to approximately $14.19 per BOE, and a 5% decrease in our proved reserve quantities would have increased our DDA rate to approximately $15.42 per BOE. Also, reserve quantities and their ultimate values are the primary factors in determining the borrowing base under our bank credit facility and are determined solely by our banks. Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation. We did not have a full cost pool ceiling test write down in 2007 or 2009. However, during 2008, commodity prices were volatile, with oil NYMEX prices moving from $95.98 per Bbl at December 31, 2007, to $140.00 per Bbl at June 30, 2008, then down to $44.60 per Bbl at December 31, 2008. Likewise, natural gas NYMEX prices went from $7.48 per Mcf as of December 31, 2007, to $13.35 per Mcf at June 30, 2008, and down to $5.62 per Mcf as of December 31, 2008. Because of the 54% decrease in NYMEX oil price and 25% decrease in NYMEX natural gas price between year end 2007 and year end 2008, we recognized a full cost pool ceiling test write down during 2008 of $226.0 million, or $13.32 per BOE. Commodity prices increased throughout 2009, ending the year with NYMEX oil prices at $79.36 per barrel, and NYMEX natural gas prices at $5.57 per Mcf. Commodity prices have historically been volatile and are expected to be in the future. If oil and natural gas should again decrease, we may be required to record additional write downs due to the full cost ceiling test. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, the full cost accounting rules require the use of the average first day of the month oil and natural gas price for each month during the 12 month period ended as of each quarterly reporting period. The amount of any future write down is difficult to predict and will depend upon the oil and natural gas prices utilized in the ceiling test, the incremental proved reserves that might be added during each period and additional capital spent. Tertiary Injection Costs Our tertiary operations are conducted in reservoirs that have already produced significant amounts of oil over many years; however, in accordance with the rules for recording proved reserves, we cannot recognize proved reserves associated with enhanced recovery techniques such as CO2 injection, until there is a production response to the injected CO2, or unless the field is analogous to an existing flood. Our costs associated with the CO2 we produce (or acquire) and inject are principally our costs of production, transportation and acquisition, and to pay royalties. Prior to January 1, 2008, we expensed currently all costs associated with injecting CO2 that we used in our tertiary recovery operations, even though some of these costs were incurred prior to any tertiary related oil production. Commencing January 1, 2008, we began capitalizing, as a development cost, injection costs in fields that are in their development stage, which means we have not yet seen incremental oil production due to the CO2 injections (i.e., a production response). These capitalized development costs will be included in our unevaluated property costs if there are not already proved tertiary reserves in that field. After we see a production response to the CO2 injections (i.e., the production stage), injection costs will be expensed as incurred and any previously deferred unevaluated development costs will become subject to depletion upon recognition of proved tertiary reserves. Had the new method of accounting for tertiary injection costs been used in periods prior to January 1, 2008, the effect on our financial statements would have been immaterial for all periods presented. During 2008 and 2009, we capitalized $10.4 million and $8.0 million, respectively, of tertiary injection costs associated with our tertiary projects that we would have previously expensed. 64 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Income Taxes We make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. Our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes, tax credits, and net operating loss carryforwards. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns. Further, we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets (primarily our enhanced oil recovery credits and state loss carryforwards). If recovery is not likely, we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover, which would result in an increase to our income tax expense. As of December 31, 2009, we believe that all of our deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet will ultimately be recovered. If our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not likely. A 1% increase in our effective tax rate would have increased our calculated income tax expense (benefit) by approximately $(1.2) million, $6.2 million, and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and see Income Taxes above for further information concerning our income taxes. Fair Value Estimates The FASC defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. It does not require us to make any new fair value measurements, but rather establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy, as they represent observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the reporting date, while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority, as they represent unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures regarding our recurring fair value measurements. Significant uses of fair value measurements include: allocation of the purchase price paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in those acquisitions, assessment of impairment of long lived assets, assessment of impairment of goodwill, and recorded value of derivative instruments. Acquisitions Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. FASC Business Combinations topic defines the acquisition date as the date on which the acquirer obtains control of the acquiree, which is usually a date different than the date the economics of the acquisition are established between the acquirer and the acquiree. FASC Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (often referred to as the exit price). A fair value measurement is based on the assumptions of market participants and not those of the reporting entity. Therefore, entity specific intentions do not impact the measurement of fair value unless those assumptions are consistent with market participant views. 65 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values involving property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. This is even more difficult due to the nature of our core business, enhanced oil recovery operations. In order to appropriately apply the FASC standard, we must estimate what value a third party market participant would place on the acquired property. This is extremely difficult as we are one of few industry entities that perform EOR operations and in our current operating area, the Gulf Coast, we are the only entity that we know of that currently has a significant source of CO2 available to them. Therefore, it is very subjective as to what value another entity would place on the potential barrels recoverable with CO2, which impacts our allocation of the purchase price to goodwill, unevaluated properties and proved properties. Although we find that this standard is difficult to apply in our circumstance, we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third party consultants for assistance. The fair values used to allocate the purchase price of an acquisition are often estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method, which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. Impairment Assessment of Goodwill We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of oil or natural gas, a full cost ceiling write down of oil and natural gas properties, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, significant changes in the expected timing of production, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment. The pending Merger, if approved, will likely result in a significant increase to our existing goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Denbury applies SEC full cost accounting rules, under which the acquisition cost of oil and gas properties is recognized on a cost center basis (country), of which Denbury has only one cost center (United States). Goodwill is assigned to this single reporting unit. Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing for impairment of our goodwill is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. A significant amount of judgment is involved performing these fair value estimates for goodwill since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include projections of future oil and natural gas prices, projections of estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, projections of future rates of production, timing and amount of future development and operating costs, projected availability and cost of CO2, projected recovery factors of tertiary reserves, and risk adjusted discount rates. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from those projections. Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Contracts We enter into oil and natural gas derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with future oil and natural gas production. These contracts have historically consisted of options, in the form of price floors or collars, and fixed price swaps. We do not designate these derivative commodity contracts as hedge instruments for accounting purposes under the FASC hedge accounting topic. This means that any changes in the future fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the balance to earnings. While we may experience more volatility in our net income than if we were to apply hedge accounting treatment as permitted by the FASC hedge accounting topic, we believe that for us the benefits associated with applying hedge accounting do not outweigh the cost, time and effort to comply with hedge accounting. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized expense (income) of $383.0 million, $(257.6) million, and $39.1 million, respectively, related to non cash changes in the fair market value of our derivative contracts. 66 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Stock Compensation Plans The FASB guidance under the Share Based Payment topic of the FASC, requires that we recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the financial statements. We estimate the fair value of stock option or stock appreciation right (SAR) awards on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option valuation model requires the input of somewhat subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and expected term. Other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the Black Scholes model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of the Companys stock. The risk free interest rates used are the U.S. Treasury yield for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant. Our dividend yield is zero, as Denbury does not pay a dividend. We utilize historical experience in arriving at our assumptions for volatility and expected term inputs. We recognize the stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. The expense we recognize is net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate our forfeiture rate based on prior experience and true it up for actual results as the awards vest. As of December 31, 2009, there was $18.8 million of total compensation cost to be recognized in future periods related to non vested stock options and SARs. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years. Asset Retirement Obligations We have significant obligations related to the plugging and abandonment of our oil, natural gas and CO2 wells, the removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and land restoration. The FASC asset retirement topic requires that we estimate the future cost of this obligation, discount it to its present value, and record a corresponding asset and liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates, including the ultimate expected cost of the obligation, the expected future date of the required cash payment, and interest and inflation rates. Revisions to these estimates may be required based on changes to cost estimates, the timing of settlement, and changes in legal requirements. Any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis and an adjustment in our DDA expense in future periods. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our asset retirement obligations. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires us to make other estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reliable, and believe that the ultimate actual results will not differ significantly from those reported; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and such risks and uncertainties could cause the actual results to differ materially from our estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Transfers of Financial Assets. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance related to the accounting for transfers of financial assets. The guidance removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE) from FASC topic, Transfers and Servicing, creates a new unit of account definition that must be met for transfers of portions of financial assets to be eligible for sale accounting, clarifies the de recognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale, changes the amount of recognized gains or losses on the transfer of financial assets accounted for as a sale when beneficial interests are received by the transferor and introduces new disclosure requirements. The new guidance is effective for us beginning January 1, 2010. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance to eliminate the exemption in the Consolidation topic of the FASC for QSPEs, introduce a new approach for determining who should consolidate a variable interest entity and change the requirement as to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a variable interest entity. We adopted the standard on January 1, 2010. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 67 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Fair Value Disclosures. In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance in the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the FASC to enhance disclosures surrounding the transfers of assets in and out of level 1 and level 2, to present more detail surrounding asset activity for level 3 assets and to clarify existing disclosure requirements. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2010, and will not have any impact on our financial position or statement of operations. Forward Looking Information The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements found in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are forward looking statements, as that term is defined in Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, and are subject to the impact of the Merger with Encore on the results of operations and financial condition of the combined company. Such forward looking statements may be or may concern, among other things, forecasted capital expenditures, drilling activity or methods, acquisition plans and proposals and dispositions, development activities, cost savings, capital budgets, production rates and volumes or forecasts thereof, hydrocarbon reserve quantities and values, CO2 reserves, potential reserves from tertiary operations, hydrocarbon prices, pricing or cost assumptions based on current and projected oil and gas prices, liquidity, cash flows, availability of capital, borrowing capacity, regulatory matters, mark to market values, competition, long term forecasts of production, finding costs, rates of return, estimated costs, or changes in costs, future capital expenditures and overall economics and other variables surrounding our operations and future plans. Such forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as plan, estimate, expect, predict, anticipate, projected, should, assume, believe, target or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Such forward looking information is based upon managements current plans, expectations, estimates and assumptions and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect current plans, anticipated actions, the timing of such actions and the Companys financial condition and results of operations. As a consequence, actual results may differ materially from expectations, estimates or assumptions expressed in or implied by any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are: fluctuations of the prices received or demand for the Companys oil and natural gas; unexpected difficulties in integrating the operations of Denbury and Encore; effects of our indebtedness; success of our risk management techniques; inaccurate cost estimates; availability of and fluctuations in the prices of goods and services; the uncertainty of drilling results and reserve estimates; operating hazards; disruption of operations and damages from hurricanes or tropical storms; acquisition risks; requirements for capital or its availability; conditions in the financial and credit markets; general economic conditions; competition and government regulations; and unexpected delays, as well as the risks and uncertainties inherent in oil and gas drilling and production activities or which are otherwise discussed in this annual report, including, without limitation, the portions referenced above, and the uncertainties set forth from time to time in the Companys other public reports, filings and public statements. 68 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
