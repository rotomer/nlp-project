Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Our discussion and analysis includes forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with Risk Factors under Item 1A of this report, along with Forward Looking Information at the end of this section for information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than our forward looking statements. Overview We are a growing independent oil and natural gas company. We are the largest oil and natural gas producer in both Mississippi and Montana, own the largest CO2 reserves used for tertiary oil recovery east of the Mississippi River, and hold significant operating acreage in the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast regions. Our goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction practices, with the most significant emphasis on our CO2 tertiary recovery operations. During 2010, we completed several strategic initiatives and achieved several milestones: Acquired Encore Acquisition Company (Encore), which established a new core area in the Rocky Mountain region; Sold non strategic legacy Encore properties and our interests in Encore Energy Partners LP (ENP) to reduce debt, which increased in conjunction with the Encore acquisition; Completed construction of our 325 mile Green Pipeline and commenced injecting CO2 transported by that pipeline into our Oyster Bayou and Hastings Fields in southeast Texas; Acquired an interest in the Riley Ridge Federal Unit (Riley Ridge) in Wyoming, a property that contains natural gas, helium and significant volumes of CO2 potentially available for use in our proposed future tertiary operations in the Rocky Mountain region; Commenced tertiary production at Delhi Field and recognized proved reserves of 29.5 MMBbls at that field; Increased our proved reserves in our Bakken play by 33.4 MMBOE to 46.7 MMBOE; Increased our proved CO2 reserves by 27% to 8.0 Tcf; and Sold our interests in Genesis Energy, L.P. (Genesis) and recognized a gain on the sale of $101.5 million. 2010 Operating Highlights. The acquisition of Encore in March 2010 (Encore Merger) has had a significant impact on nearly every aspect of our business, including oil and natural gas production, revenues and operating expenses, which is more fully discussed throughout the analysis below. Encores results were included in Denburys results beginning from the March 9, 2010, acquisition date. We recognized net income of $271.7 million during 2010, or $0.73 per common share, compared to a net loss of $75.2 million, or $0.30 per common share during 2009. Although the Encore Merger had a significant impact on our 2010 revenues and operating expenses, when evaluating the change in net income between the two years a couple of items stand out: (1) a $436.0 million pre tax ($270.3 million after tax) increase in our income due to non cash fair value changes in our commodity derivative contracts, and (2) a $101.5 million pre tax ($62.9 million after tax) gain on sale of our interests in Genesis in 2010. In 2010, NYMEX oil and natural gas prices averaged $79.51 per Bbl and $4.40 per MMbtu, respectively, higher than average prices of $61.96 per Bbl and $4.17 per MMBtu during 2009. However, as oil comprises a majority of our production volumes, our average revenue per BOE, excluding the impact of oil and natural gas derivative contracts, was $67.37 per BOE in 2010, as compared to $49.16 per BOE in 2009, a 37% increase between the two periods. During 2010, our oil and natural gas production averaged 72,927 BOE/d, a 51% increase over average production for 2009. Our continuing production, which in 2009 excludes the production from our Barnett Shale properties, which were sold in 2009, and which in 2010 excludes our non strategic legacy Encore and ENP properties, which were sold in 2010, increased 20,513 BOE/d (53%), from 38,760 BOE/d in 2009 to 59,273 BOE/d in 2010. This increase was due primarily to production from the properties acquired in the Encore Merger (15,500 BOE/d) and 34 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations an increase in our tertiary production (4,719 BOE/d). On a pro forma basis, our continuing production adjusted to include continuing production from the Encore properties for the whole year beginning January 1, 2010, instead of the March 9, 2010, acquisition date, Denburys continuing pro forma production (62,558 BOE/d ) would have increased 61% rather than 53% over continuing production in 2009. See Results of Operations Operating Results Production for more information. Tertiary oil production averaged 29,062 BOE/d during 2010, representing a 19% increase over our tertiary oil production during 2009. We had strong production increases during 2010 from several of our existing tertiary oil fields, and had initial production response from CO2 injections at Delhi Field during the second quarter of 2010. See Results of Operations CO2 Operations for more information. Cash payments on our commodity derivative contracts during 2010 were $31.6 million, compared to $146.7 million received during 2009. During 2010, we had a non cash fair value gain on our derivative contracts of $53.0 million, compared to a non cash fair value loss of $383.0 million in 2009. Coupled together, our total adjustments on our commodity derivative contracts reflected a net swing between 2009 and 2010 of $257.6 million of additional pretax income in 2010 ($159.7 million after tax). Our lease operating expenses increased 49% ($160.8 million) between 2009 and 2010 on an absolute basis, but decreased 1% on a per BOE basis. The increase on an absolute basis is primarily attributable to the properties acquired in the Encore Merger and further expansion of our tertiary operations, partially offset by the 2009 sale of our Barnett Shale properties. The decrease on a per BOE basis is primarily due to the Encore Merger, as the assets acquired have a lower production cost per BOE than Denburys legacy assets, of which the majority are CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR). General and administrative expenses totaled $139.7 million during 2010, a 30% increase from 2009 levels, due primarily to incremental administrative expense incurred as a result of the Encore Merger. In addition, during 2010 we incurred $92.3 million of transaction costs associated with the Encore Merger, primarily associated with employee severance and third party fees. Encore Merger related fees are included in our income statement under the caption Transaction costs and other related to the Encore Merger. Interest expense also increased during 2010, primarily due to our issuance of $1.0 billion of senior subordinated notes due 2020 in February 2010, debt assumed in the Encore Merger, and slightly less interest capitalization. Merger with Encore Acquisition Company. On March 9, 2010, we acquired Encore pursuant to the Encore Merger Agreement entered into with Encore on October 31, 2009. The Encore Merger Agreement provided for a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $4.8 billion at the acquisition date, including the assumption of Encore debt and the value of the noncontrolling interest in ENP. Under the Encore Merger Agreement, Encore was merged with and into Denbury, with Denbury surviving the Encore Merger. The Encore Merger was consummated on March 9, 2010. In the Encore Merger, we issued approximately 135.2 million shares of our common stock and paid approximately $833.9 million in cash to Encore stockholders. The Denbury shares issued to Encore stockholders represented approximately 34% of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately after the Encore Merger. The total fair value of the Denbury common stock issued to Encore stockholders pursuant to the Encore Merger was approximately $2.1 billion based upon our closing price of $15.43 per share on March 9, 2010. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Encore Merger was financed through a combination of $1.0 billion of 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020, (the 2020 Notes), which we issued on February 10, 2010, a new $1.6 billion revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) entered into on March 9, 2010, and the assumption of Encores remaining outstanding senior subordinated notes. We structured the financing of the Encore Merger to provide $600 million to $700 million of availability under the new bank facility upon closing the transaction in order to provide a level of liquidity similar to our liquidity prior to the Encore Merger. Pursuant to our intent to divest non strategic legacy Encore properties, properties in the Permian Basin, Mid continent area and East Texas Basin (collectively, the Southern Assets) and in the Cleveland Sand Play were sold during the second and third quarters of 2010. During the 35 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations fourth quarter of 2010, we sold our legacy Encore Haynesville and East Texas natural gas properties and sold our ownership interests in ENP. Aggregate proceeds from these 2010 transactions included approximately $1.5 billion in cash and 3,137,255 common units of Vanguard Natural Resources LLP (Vanguard) (NYSE:VNR) as part of the ENP sale. At December 31, 2010, the Vanguard common units had a value of approximately $93 million. In addition, Vanguard assumed $234 million of ENP bank debt. Proceeds were used to reduce our bank debt during 2010, which increased as a result of the Encore Merger, and provide additional liquidity which we plan to use to fund a portion of our capital spending in 2011 and repay up to $125 million of our senior subordinated notes in early 2011 (see Capital Resources and Liquidity below). For all Encore legacy properties disposed of during 2010, we reduced our full cost pool by the amount of the net proceeds and did not record a gain or loss on the sale in accordance with the full cost method of accounting. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these transactions. Completion of Green Pipeline. The Green Pipeline is a 325 mile CO2 pipeline that runs from Southern Louisiana to near Houston, Texas. In June 2010, we placed the first 267 miles of the Green Pipeline from Southern Louisiana to our Oyster Bayou Field in Southeast Texas in service, and we began CO2 injections at Oyster Bayou Field. During December 2010, we placed the remaining portion of the Green Pipeline from Oyster Bayou Field to Hastings Field in service, and we began CO2 injections at Hastings Field. The Green Pipeline is also expected to service other tertiary operations along the Gulf Coast. Acquisition of reserves in Rocky Mountain region at Riley Ridge. In October 2010, we acquired a 42.5% non operated working interest in the Riley Ridge Federal Unit (Riley Ridge), located in southwestern Wyoming, together with approximately 33% of the CO2 mineral rights in an additional 28,000 acres adjoining Riley Ridge in which we own a non operating interest, for consideration of $132.3 million after preliminary closing adjustments. Riley Ridge has proved and probable natural gas, helium and CO2 reserves. The first production of natural gas and helium from Riley Ridge is expected to occur in late 2011 after the operator completes construction of the processing facilities to separate the natural gas and helium. The net development costs to our interest were approximately $9 million during 2010, are expected to be approximately $42 million in 2011, and are primarily associated with constructing the processing facilities that will separate the natural gas and helium. Any potential tertiary oil production using the CO2 from Riley Ridge is contingent on the development of facilities to separate the CO2 from the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) along with a pipeline framework and significant capital expenditures. The full well stream at Riley Ridge is expected to contain approximately 68% CO2, 19% natural gas, 12% H2S and 1% helium and other gases. Currently, the operator plans to re inject the CO2 and H2S; however, we have the right to separate and take the CO2 and re inject the H2S. At this time, we are evaluating other potential CO2 sources in the region, and therefore, we have not committed to a definitive timetable for utilization of the Riley Ridge CO2 reserves in our tertiary oil fields in the Rocky Mountain region. Sale of Interests in Genesis. In February 2010, we sold our interest in Genesis Energy, LLC, the general partner of Genesis Energy, L.P., for net proceeds of approximately $84 million, after giving effect to the change of control provision of the incentive compensation agreement with Genesis management, which was triggered and under which we paid a total of $14.9 million comprised of deferred compensation of $1.9 million and a change of control redemption of $13.0 million. In February 2010, we recognized general and administrative expense of $1.1 million associated with the $14.9 million payment. The remainder of the payment had been previously accrued in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2009. In March 2010, we sold all of our Genesis common units in a secondary public offering for net proceeds of approximately $79 million. As a result, we no longer hold any interest in Genesis. We recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $101.5 million ($63.0 million after tax) on these dispositions. February 2011 Debt Issuance and Tender Offer On February 3, 2011, we commenced cash tender offers to purchase any and all of our outstanding $225 million in principal amount of our 7% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 (2013 Notes) and $300 million in principal amount of our 7% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (2015 Notes). On February 16, 2011, the early consent date, we accepted for purchase $169.5 million in principal of the 2013 36 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Notes at 100.625% of par and $220.9 million in principal of the 2015 Notes at 104.125% of par. The tender offers will expire on March 3, 2011. The tenders accepted for repurchase on February 16, 2011 were primarily funded with $393 million in net proceeds from our February 17, 2011 issuance of $400 million of 63/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021 (2021 Notes). The 2021 Notes, which carry a coupon rate of 6.375%, were sold at par. On February 17, 2011, we called for redemption all of the remaining outstanding 2013 and 2015 Notes and will fund the remaining repurchases with cash on hand. The net impact of these refinancing transactions is expected to result in the utilization of approximately $147 million of cash on hand including $125 million for the repurchase of the principal amount of the 2013 Notes and 2015 Notes, $14 million in premiums on the notes and $8 million of fees and expenses. Capital Resources and Liquidity In order to facilitate the financing of the Encore Merger and to retire approximately $600 million of Encores subordinated debt, in early 2010 we entered into a new $1.6 billion, four year bank facility and issued $1.0 billion in 81/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020. During 2010, in order to reduce the bank debt incurred to acquire Encore, we sold non strategic properties that were included in the Encore Merger as well as our ownership interests in ENP. In the aggregate, these transactions generated approximately $1.5 billion of cash and $93 million of Vanguard common units, which provided adequate cash to repay all of our credit facility as of December 31, 2010, fund our acquisition of Riley Ridge, and leave us with $381.9 million of cash and $93 million of Vanguard common units at December 31, 2010, more than ample liquidity to cover our 2011 planned capital expenditures in excess of anticipated cash flow (see further discussion below). In early February 2011, in conjunction with refinancing a portion of our senior subordinated notes, we made tender offers to purchase our $225 million of 7% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013, at 100.625% of par, and our $300 million of 7% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015, at 104.125% of par. To partially fund these repurchases, we issued $400 million of 6% Senior Subordinated Notes due August 2021. We estimate that we will utilize approximately $147 million of cash on hand including $125 million for the repurchase of the principal amount of the 2013 Notes and 2015 Notes, $14 million of premiums on these notes and $8 million of fees and expenses. See February 2011 Debt Issuance and Tender Offer above. We estimate our 2011 capital spending will be approximately $1.2 billion, net of equipment leases and including approximately $100 million for capitalized interest and startup costs associated with new tertiary floods. Our current 2011 capital budget includes the following: $420 million allocated for tertiary oil field expenditures, $300 million for development of our Bakken properties, $219 million for pipeline construction and maintenance, $71 million to be spent in the Jackson Dome area, $100 million of capitalized interest and startup costs, and $90 million in all other areas. This estimate of our 2011 capital spending assumes that we fund approximately $60 million of budgeted equipment purchases with operating leases, which is dependent upon securing acceptable financing. If we do not enter into a total of $60 million of operating leases during 2011, our net capital expenditures would increase accordingly, and we would anticipate funding those additional capital expenditures with our available cash or borrowings under our bank credit facility. Based on oil and natural gas commodity futures prices as of late February 2011 and our current 2011 production forecasts, our 2011 capital budget is expected to be $100 million to $200 million greater than our anticipated cash flow from operations. We plan to fund this shortfall with cash on hand at December 31, 2010 and, if necessary, borrowings under our bank facility. Also, we could potentially monetize the Vanguard common units we hold; however, registration rights regarding those units do not become available to us until August 2011. As of February 25, 2011, we had $130 million of bank debt outstanding on our $1.6 billion bank facility and estimated cash of $422 million, leaving us significant liquidity to fund any shortfall. To help protect our cash flows in case commodity prices were to decrease significantly from the levels of futures strip prices near the end of February 2011, we currently have oil and natural gas derivative commodity contracts in place through mid 2012 covering approximately 80 85% of our anticipated 2011 oil and natural gas production and 75 80% of our anticipated 37 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations first half 2012 oil and natural gas production. We are primarily dependent on oil prices, as approximately 90% of our continuing production (excluding production from properties sold) is oil, and most of our oil contracts are costless collars with a NYMEX floor price of $70 per barrel. See Note 9, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding pricing and volumes of our commodity derivative contracts. We continually monitor our capital spending and anticipated cash flows and believe that we can adjust our capital spending up or down depending on cash flows; however, any such reduction in capital spending could reduce our anticipated production levels in future years. For 2011, we have contracted for certain capital expenditures and therefore we cannot eliminate all of our capital commitments without penalties (refer to Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Commitments and Obligations for further information regarding these commitments). As part of our semi annual bank review, on November 1, 2010, our borrowing base for our bank credit facility was reaffirmed at $1.6 billion. Our next borrowing base re determination is scheduled for May 1, 2011 and we currently do not anticipate any reduction in our borrowing base as part of our next re determination. Capital Expenditure Summary for 2010. The following table of capital expenditures includes accrued capital for each period.

Net cash used to acquire Encore was approximately $815 million, which was funded with incremental debt as discussed above in Overview Merger with Encore Acquisition Company. Our 2009 capital expenditures were funded with $530.6 million of cash flow from operations, $516.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties, $381.4 million in net proceeds from the February issuance of senior subordinated debt, $168.7 million from the issuance of 11,620,000 shares of our common stock in the acquisition of Conroe Field and $50.0 million in net bank borrowings. Our 2008 capital expenditures were funded with $774.5 million of cash flow from operations, $225 million from the drop down of CO2 pipelines to Genesis and $51.7 million from the sale of oil and natural gas properties. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Commitments and Obligations. At December 31, 2010, our largest contractual payment obligation that is not on our balance sheet relates to our operating leases, which at year end 2010 totaled $237.2 million, relating primarily to the lease financing of certain equipment for CO2 recycling facilities at our tertiary oil fields. We also have several leases relating to office space and other minor equipment leases. At December 31, 2010, we had a total of $10.9 million of letters of credit outstanding under our bank credit agreement. Additionally, we have obligations that are not currently recorded on our balance sheet relating to various obligations for development and exploratory expenditures that arise from our normal capital expenditure program or from other transactions common to our industry. In addition, in order to recover our undeveloped proved reserves, we must also fund the associated future development costs forecasted in our proved reserve reports and asset retirement obligations. For a further discussion of our future development costs and proved reserves, see the contractual obligations table below. 39 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Included in our obligations for development and exploratory expenditures are those related to our February 2009 purchase of Hastings Field. Under the agreement, we are required to make aggregate cumulative capital expenditures in this field of approximately $179 million cumulating as follows: $26.8 million by December 31, 2010, $71.5 million by December 31, 2011, $107.2 million by December 31, 2012, $142.9 million by December 31, 2013, and $178.7 million by December 31, 2014. If we fail to spend the required amounts by the due dates, we are required to make a cash payment equal to 10% of the cumulative shortfall at each applicable date. Further, we are committed to inject an average of at least 50 MMcf/d of CO2 (total of purchased and recycled) in the West Hastings Unit for the 90 day period prior to January 1, 2013. If such injections do not occur, we must either (1) relinquish our rights to initiate (or continue) tertiary operations and reassign to Venoco all assets previously purchased for the value of such assets at that time based upon the discounted value of the fields proved reserves using a 20% discount rate, or (2) make an additional payment of $20 million in January 2013, less any payments made for failure to meet the capital spending requirements as of December 31, 2012, and a $30 million payment for each subsequent year (less amounts paid for capital expenditure shortfalls) until the CO2 injection rate in the Hastings Field equals or exceeds the minimum required injection rate. As of December 31, 2010, we are, and believe we will continue to be, compliant with both of these commitments. We have entered into long term contracts to purchase man made CO2 from nine proposed plants that will emit large volumes of CO2, four of which are in the Gulf Coast region, four in the Midwest region (Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky) and one in the Rocky Mountain region. The Midwest purchases are conditioned on both the specific plant being constructed and Denbury contracting enough volumes of CO2 for purchase in the general area of our proposed Midwest pipeline system, such that an acceptable economic rate of return on the CO2 pipeline will be achieved. At the present time, two of the Midwest facilities have been unable to meet a critical contractual obligation and thus Denbury is evaluating these two projects to determine if we should extend the time for the facility to meet the contractual obligation. If all nine of these plants were to be built, these CO2 sources are currently anticipated to provide us with aggregate CO2 volumes of 1.2 Bcf/d to 2.0 Bcf/d, although the earliest source of this man made CO2 is not expected to be available to us until 2014. Although these plants have all been delayed due to economic conditions, over the last six to nine months several of the projects appear to be making progress, but there is still some doubt as to whether they will be constructed at all. Several of these plants are in negotiations for federal support through grants and loan guarantees, which if secured, could increase the possibility that certain plants will be ultimately constructed. The base price of CO2 per Mcf from these CO2 sources varies by plant and location, but is generally higher than our most recent all in cost of CO2 from our Jackson Dome using current oil prices. Prices for CO2 delivered from these projects are expected to be competitive with the cost of our natural CO2 after adjusting for our share of potential carbon emissions reduction credits using estimated futures prices of carbon emissions reduction credits. If all nine plants are built, the aggregate purchase obligation for this CO2 would be around $320 million per year, assuming an $85 per barrel NYMEX oil price, before any potential savings from our share of carbon emissions reduction credits. All of the contracts have price adjustments that fluctuate based on the price of oil. Construction has not yet commenced on any of these plants, and their construction is contingent on the satisfactory resolution of various issues, including financing. While it is likely that not every plant currently under contract will be constructed, there are other plants under consideration that could provide CO2 to us that would either supplement or replace some of the CO2 volumes from the nine proposed plants for which we currently have CO2 output purchase contracts. We have ongoing discussions with several of these other potential sources. We are subject to audits for sales and use taxes and severance taxes in the various states in which we operate, and from time to time receive assessments for potential taxes that we may owe. We have received a $14.9 million assessment from the Mississippi taxing authority for use tax, penalties and interest covering the 2004 2007 period, which has been appealed. We do not believe the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse impact on the Company. 40 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

This table assumes that our long term debt is held until maturity. During February 2011, we repurchased a portion of our 2013 Notes and 2015 Notes and issued $400 million in additional senior subordinated notes. See Note 15, Subsequent Events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (b) Represents estimated future cash payments under a long term transportation service agreement for the Free State Pipeline, and future minimum cash payments in a 20 year financing lease for the NEJD pipeline system. Both transactions with Genesis were entered into in 2008 and are being accounted for as financing leases. The payment required for the Free State Pipeline is variable based upon the amount of the CO2 we ship through the pipeline and the commitment amounts disclosed above for that financing lease are computed based upon our internal forecasts. Approximately $290 million of these payments represent interest. See Note 5, Notes Payable and Long Term Indebtedness, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (c) Represents future minimum cash commitments of $3.5 million to Genesis under capital leases in place at December 31, 2010, primarily for transportation of crude oil and CO2, and $4.5 million for office space and rental equipment. Approximately $1.2 million of these payments represents interest. (d) Represents future cash commitments under contracts in place as of December 31, 2010, primarily for pipe, pipeline construction contracts, drilling rig services and well related costs. As is common in our industry, we commit to make certain expenditures on a regular basis as part of our ongoing development and exploration program. These commitments generally relate to projects that occur during the subsequent several months and are usually part of our normal operating expenses or part of our capital budget, which for 2011 is currently set at $1.2 billion, exclusive of acquisitions. In certain cases we have the ability to terminate contracts for equipment in which case we would be liable only for the cost incurred by the vendor up to that point; however, as we currently do not anticipate cancelling those contracts these amounts include our estimated payments under those contracts. We also have recurring expenditures for such things as accounting, engineering and legal fees; software maintenance; subscriptions; and other overhead type items. Normally these expenditures do not change materially on an aggregate basis from year to year and are part of our general and administrative expenses. We have not attempted to estimate the amounts of these types of recurring expenditures in this table as most could be quickly cancelled with regard to any specific vendor, even though the expense itself may be required for ongoing normal operations of the Company. (e) Represents the estimated future payments under our oil and natural gas derivative contracts based on the futures market prices as of December 31, 2010. These amounts will change as oil and natural gas commodity prices change. The estimated fair market value of our oil and natural gas commodity derivatives at December 31, 2010, was a $44 million net liability. See further discussion of our derivative contracts and their market price sensitivities in Market Risk Management below in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in Note 9, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (f) Represents projected capital costs as scheduled in our December 31, 2010 proved reserve report that are necessary in order to recover our proved oil and natural gas reserves. These are not contractual commitments and are net of any other capital obligations shown under Contractual Obligations in the table above. (g) Represents projected capital costs as scheduled in our December 31, 2010 proved reserve report that are necessary in order to recover our proved CO2 reserves from our CO2 source wells used to produce CO2 for our tertiary operations. These are not contractual commitments and are net of any other capital obligations shown above. (h) Represents the estimated future asset retirement obligations on an undiscounted basis. The present discounted asset retirement obligation is $85.7 million, as determined under the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations topic of the FASC, and is further discussed in Note 3, Asset Retirement Obligations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long term contracts require us to deliver CO2 to our industrial CO2 customers at various contracted prices, plus we have a CO2 delivery obligation to Genesis pursuant to three volumetric production payments (VPPs). Based upon the maximum amounts deliverable as stated in the industrial contracts and the volumetric production payments, we estimate that we may be obligated to deliver up to 382 Bcf of CO2 to these customers over the next 17 years; however, since the group as a whole has historically taken less CO2 than the maximum allowed in their contracts, based on the current level of deliveries, we project that our commitment would likely be reduced to approximately 194 Bcf. The maximum volume required in any given year is approximately 136 MMcf/d. Given the size of our Jackson Dome proved CO2 reserves at December 31, 2010 (approximately 7.1 Tcf before deducting approximately 100.2 Bcf for the three VPPs), our current production capabilities and our projected levels of CO2 usage for our own tertiary flooding program, we believe that we will be able to meet these delivery obligations. Concurrent with our purchase of an interest in the Riley Ridge Field, we became party to a long term helium supply agreement whereby the 41 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations participants in the Riley Ridge Field will supply helium to a purchaser for a period of 20 years beginning at the earlier of the start up of the Riley Ridge plant or December 31, 2011. The agreement provides for annual delivery of 200 MMcf for the first two years and 400 MMcf for the remaining term of the contract. If the guaranteed quantity of helium is not supplied, the suppliers will compensate the purchaser for the amount of the shortfall in an amount not to exceed $8.0 million per year, of which the Companys share would be $3.4 million. The start up of the Riley Ridge plant is expected to occur in late 2011. Results of Operations CO2 Operations Overview. Since we acquired our first CO2 tertiary flood in Mississippi in 1999, we have gradually increased our emphasis on these types of operations. During this time, we have learned a considerable amount about tertiary operations and working with CO2 and we have continued to expand our CO2 resources and acquire oil fields throughout the Gulf Coast region that have the potential to produce significant amounts of oil from CO2 injection. In March 2010 we acquired Encore for the primary purpose of expanding our tertiary operations to a new core area in the Rocky Mountain region, and our acquisition of an interest in Riley Ridge later in 2010 further supports this strategy as it potentially provides us a large source of CO2. Although our development of tertiary operations in this new area is just beginning, we believe there are sufficient potential sources of CO2 in this area to provide us the opportunity to utilize CO2 injection and to potentially recover significant amounts of incremental oil from old oil fields in this area. Our tertiary operations have grown to the point that approximately 41% of our December 31, 2010 proved oil and natural gas reserves are proved tertiary oil reserves and almost 49% of our forecasted 2011 oil and natural gas production is expected to come from tertiary oil operations (on a BOE basis). We particularly like this play as (1) it has a lower risk as we are working with oil fields that have significant historical production and data, (2) it provides a reasonable rate of return at relatively low oil prices (we estimate that our economic break even point on a per barrel basis before corporate overhead and expenses on these projects at current oil prices is in the mid to upper $30 per barrel range, depending on the specific field and area), and (3) we have limited competition for this type of activity in our geographic regions. Our Gulf Coast region is more fully developed, as we have been conducting tertiary recovery in this area for over 11 years. Since we are just beginning our tertiary operations in the Rocky Mountain region, we have significantly fewer oil fields, CO2 sources and CO2 pipelines in this region, although we are pursuing the addition of all three. In the Gulf Coast region, we own the only known significant natural resource of CO2 in the area, and these large volumes of CO2 drive the play. In addition to the sources of CO2 we currently have, we are pursuing anthropogenic (man made) sources of CO2 to use in our tertiary operations, which we believe will not only help us recover additional oil, but will provide an economical way to sequester CO2. We have acquired several old oil fields in our areas of operations with potential for tertiary recovery, and plan to acquire additional fields. We are continuing to expand our CO2 pipeline infrastructure to transport CO2. We refer to our Gulf Coast tertiary operations by labeling our operating areas or groups of fields as Phases: Phase 1 is in southwest Mississippi and includes several fields along our 183 mile NEJD CO2 Pipeline that we acquired in 2001. The current tertiary fields in this area are Little Creek, Mallalieu, McComb, Brookhaven and Lockhart Crossing; Phase 2, which began with the early 2006 completion of the Free State CO2 Pipeline to east Mississippi, currently includes Eucutta, Soso, Martinville and Heidelberg Fields; Phase 3, which includes Tinsley Field, is located northwest of Jackson, Mississippi, was acquired in January 2006, and is serviced by that portion of the Delta CO2 Pipeline completed in January 2008; Phase 4 includes Cranfield and Lake St. John Fields, two fields near the Mississippi/Louisiana border located west of the Phase 1 fields; Phase 5 is Delhi Field, a Louisiana field we acquired in 2006, located southwest of Tinsley Field. Our first tertiary oil response from Delhi Field occurred during early 2010; 42 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Phase 6 is Citronelle Field in southwest Alabama, another field acquired in 2006, which will require an extension to the Free State CO2 Pipeline or another pipeline depending on the ultimate CO2 source for this field, the timing of which is uncertain at this time; Phase 7 is Hastings Field in southeast Texas, a field we purchased in February 2009, where we commenced CO2 injections during December 2010 in conjunction with placing the final leg of the Green Pipeline into service; Phase 8 is Seabreeze Complex in southeast Texas, acquired in 2007, where we initiated CO2 injections at Oyster Bayou Field in June 2010; and Phase 9 is Conroe Field, a field we purchased in December 2009, which will require construction of an additional CO2 pipeline to connect the field to the Green Pipeline in southeast Texas. In the Rocky Mountain region, we have two fields that we acquired in the Encore Merger that we plan to flood with CO2, Bell Creek Field and Cedar Creek Anticline. We must first build a pipeline to these fields; we plan to begin construction in 2011. We plan to begin injection of CO2 at Bell Creek Field in late 2012 or early 2013. See further discussion regarding our tertiary operations in Item 1, Business Oil and Natural Gas Operations Rocky Mountain Region Future Tertiary Properties without Proved Tertiary Reserves or Tertiary Production at December 31, 2010. CO2 Resources. Since we acquired the Jackson Dome CO2 source located near Jackson, Mississippi, in 2001, we have continued to develop the area and have increased the proven CO2 reserves from approximately 800 Bcf at the time of the acquisition to approximately 7.1 Tcf as of December 31, 2010. During 2010, we drilled three additional CO2 source wells, and we increased our CO2 reserves by approximately 1.0 Tcf, more than offsetting the 311.1 Bcf of CO2 produced during the year. The estimate of 7.1 Tcf of proved Gulf Coast CO2 reserves is based on 100% ownership of the CO2 reserves, of which our net revenue interest ownership is approximately 5.6 Tcf. Both reserve estimates are included in the evaluation of proven CO2 reserves prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton. In discussing the available CO2 reserves, we make reference to the gross amount of proved reserves, as this is the amount that is available for our tertiary recovery programs, industrial users, and volumetric production payments with Genesis, as we are responsible for distributing the entire CO2 production stream for all of these uses. We currently estimate that it will take approximately 2.5 Tcf of CO2 to develop and produce the proved tertiary oil recovery reserves we have recorded at December 31, 2010, in Phases 1 5. Today, we own every known producing CO2 well in the Gulf Coast region, providing us a significant strategic advantage in the acquisition of other properties in Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas that could be further exploited through tertiary recovery. As of February 28, 2011, we estimate that we are capable of producing and transporting approximately 1.1 Bcf/d of CO2, approximately 10 times the rate that we were capable of producing at the time of our initial acquisition in 2001. We continue to drill additional CO2 wells, with four more wells planned for 2011 in order to further increase our proved CO2 reserves and production capacity. Our drilling activity at Jackson Dome will continue beyond 2011, as our current forecasts for the existing nine phases suggest that we will need approximately 1.5 Bcf/d of CO2 production by 2017. In addition to using CO2 for our Gulf Coast tertiary operations, we sell CO2 to third party industrial users under long term contracts. Most of these industrial contracts have been sold to Genesis along with the sale of volumetric production payments for the CO2. Our average daily CO2 production during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately 852 MMcf/d, 683 MMcf/d and 637 MMcf/d, respectively, of which approximately 87% in 2010, 87% in 2009 and 86% in 2008 was used in our tertiary recovery operations, with the balance delivered to Genesis under the volumetric production payments or sold to third party industrial users. Our cost to produce, transport and pay royalties for the CO2 we utilize in our tertiary floods was approximately $0.22 per Mcf in 2010, as compared to our 2009 average cost of $0.17 per Mcf, and 2008 average cost of $0.22 per Mcf. The changes in our cost of CO2 are primarily directly attributable to changes in oil prices, as the royalty we pay is directly tied to oil prices. Our CO2 costs gradually increased throughout 2010 from $0.20 per Mcf in the first quarter to $0.24 per Mcf in the fourth quarter of 2010, corresponding to the increase in oil prices. Our estimated total cost per thousand cubic feet of CO2 during 2010 was approximately $0.30 per Mcf, after inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense related to the CO2 production, as compared to approximately $0.25 per Mcf during 2009 and $0.30 per Mcf during 2008. 43 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In addition to our natural source of CO2 and the proposed gasification plants discussed above (see Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Commitments and Obligations), we continue to have ongoing discussions with owners of existing plants of various types that emit CO2 that we may be able to purchase. In order to capture such volumes, we (or the plant owner) would need to install additional equipment, which includes at a minimum, compression and dehydration facilities. Most of these existing plants emit relatively small volumes of CO2, generally less than the proposed gasification plants, but such volumes may still be attractive if the source is located near our Green Pipeline or planned Greencore Pipeline. The capture of CO2 could also be influenced by potential federal legislation, which could impose economic penalties for the emission of CO2. We believe that we are a likely purchaser of CO2 produced in our areas of operation because of the scale of our tertiary operations, our CO2 pipeline infrastructure, and our large natural sources of CO2, which can act as a swing CO2 source to balance CO2 supply and demand. Overview of Tertiary Economics. When we began our Gulf Coast tertiary operations several years ago, they were generally economic at oil prices below $20 per Bbl, although the economics varied by field. Our costs have escalated during the last few years due to general cost inflation in the industry and higher oil prices, and we estimate that our current break even for our Gulf Coast operations, before corporate overhead and interest, is in the mid to upper $30 per barrel range if oil prices remain at their current level (approximately $85 $90 per barrel). Our inception to date finding and development costs (including future development and abandonment costs but excluding expenditures on fields without proven reserves) for our Gulf Coast tertiary oil fields through December 31, 2010, are approximately $13.05 per BOE. Currently, we forecast that finding and development costs will average less than $10 per BOE over the life of each field, excluding pipeline infrastructure, and less than $12 per BOE over the life of each field, including pipeline infrasructure, depending on the state of a particular field at the time we begin operations, the amount of potential oil, the proximity to a pipeline or other facilities, and other factors. Our finding and development costs to date do not include additional probable reserves in fields with current proved reserves. Our operating costs for our Gulf Coast tertiary operations are highly dependent on commodity prices and could range from $20 per BOE to $25 per BOE over the life of each field, again depending on the field itself. Although we have yet to commence tertiary operations in our Rocky Mountain region, it is our expectation that our tertiary operating costs, including the cost of CO2 resources, will be higher than our tertiary operating costs in the Gulf Coast region. The primary factor contributing to this increase is that while our current source for CO2 in the Gulf Coast region is a natural source completely operated and controlled by us, potential sources of CO2 in the Rocky Mountain region will require some degree of processing and may involve joint operations or purchase agreements with third parties, all of which will contribute to higher costs. However, pipeline construction costs in the Rocky Mountain region are anticipated to be lower than those incurred in the Gulf Coast region due to differing geographic and regulatory factors. While these economic factors have wide ranges, our rate of return from these operations has generally been higher than our rate of return on traditional oil and gas operations, and thus our tertiary operations have become our single most important area of focus. While it is difficult to accurately forecast future production, we do believe our tertiary recovery operations provide significant long term production growth potential at reasonable rates of return, with relatively low risk, and thus will be the backbone of our growth for the foreseeable future. Although we believe that our plans and projections are reasonable and achievable, there could be delays or unforeseen problems in the future that could delay or affect the economics of our overall tertiary development program. We believe that such delays or price effects, if any, should only be temporary. Financial Statement Impact of CO2 Operations. Our increasing emphasis on CO2 tertiary recovery projects has significantly impacted, and will continue to impact, our financial results and certain operating statistics. First, there is a significant delay between the initial capital expenditures on these fields and the resulting production increases. We must build facilities, and often a CO2 pipeline to the field, before CO2 flooding can commence, and it usually takes six to twelve months before the field responds to the injection of CO2 (i.e., oil production commences). Further, we may spend significant amounts of capital before we can recognize any proven reserves from fields we flood (see 44 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Analysis of CO2 Tertiary Recovery Operating Activities below). Even after a field has proven reserves, there will usually be significant amounts of additional capital required to fully develop the field. However, on an overall basis, future development costs of our tertiary operations tend to be lower than those in conventional oil operations. Second, tertiary projects may be more expensive to operate than other oil fields because of the cost of injecting and recycling the CO2 (primarily due to the significant energy requirements to re compress the CO2 back into a near liquid state for re injection purposes). The costs of our CO2 and the electricity required to recycle and inject this CO2 comprise almost half of our typical tertiary operating expenses, and since these costs vary along with commodity and electrical prices, they are highly variable and will increase in a high commodity price environment and decrease in a low price environment. As an example (as discussed above), during 2010 the cost of our CO2 varied from $0.20 per Mcf to $0.24 per Mcf. Most of our CO2 operating costs are allocated to our tertiary oil fields and recorded as lease operating expenses (following the commencement of tertiary oil production) at the time the CO2 is injected, and these costs have historically represented over 25% of the total operating costs for our tertiary operations. Since we expense all of the operating costs to produce and inject our CO2 (following the commencement of tertiary oil production), the operating costs per barrel will be higher at the inception of CO2 injection projects because of minimal related oil production at that time. Analysis of CO2 Tertiary Recovery Operating Activities. In our Gulf Coast region, we currently have tertiary operations ongoing at all planned Phase 1 fields; at Soso, Martinville, Eucutta and Heidelberg Fields in Phase 2; Tinsley Field in Phase 3; Cranfield Field in Phase 4; Delhi Field in Phase 5; Hastings Field in Phase 7; and Oyster Bayou Field in Phase 8. We project that our oil production from our CO2 operations will increase substantially over the next several years as we continue to expand this program by adding projects and phases. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 163.3 MMBbls of proved oil reserves related to tertiary operations (42.7 MMBbls in Phase 1, 49.2 MMBbls in Phase 2, 33.8 MMBbls in Phase 3, 8.2 MMBbls in Phase 4, and 29.4 MMBbles in Phase 5), representing about 41% of our total corporate proved reserves, and have identified and estimate significant additional oil potential in other fields that we own in this region. We added 39.4 MMBbls of tertiary related proved oil reserves during 2010, primarily initial proven tertiary oil reserves at Delhi Field in Phase 5. In order to recognize proved tertiary oil reserves, we must either have an oil production response to the CO2 injections or the field must be analogous to an existing tertiary flood. The magnitude of proven reserves that we can book in any given year will depend on our progress with new floods and the timing of the production response from new floods and the performance of our existing floods. Our average annual oil production from our CO2 tertiary recovery activities has increased over time, from 3,970 Bbls/d in 2002 to 29,062 Bbls/d during 2010 (31,139 Bbls/d during the fourth quarter of 2010). Tertiary oil production represented approximately 54% of our continuing oil production during 2010 and approximately 49% of our continuing production of both oil and natural gas during the same period on a BOE basis. We expect that this tertiary related oil production will continue to increase, although the increases are not always predictable or consistent. While we may have temporary fluctuations in oil production related to tertiary operations, this usually does not indicate any issue with the proved and potential oil reserves recoverable with CO2. A detailed discussion of each of our tertiary oil fields and the development of each is included in Item 1. Business. The following chart shows our tertiary oil production by field by quarter for 2010 and for the years ending December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: 45 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

Tertiary oil production during the fourth quarter of 2010 averaged 31,139 Bbls/d, an 18% increase over the fourth quarter 2009 levels, and a 5% sequential increase from third quarter 2010 levels. These year over year increases are the result of production growth in response to continued expansion of the tertiary floods in our Tinsley, Heidelberg, Cranfield, and Lockhart Crossing Fields, and to initial production response from Delhi Field during 2010. Offsetting these production gains were declines in our Mallalieu and Eucutta Fields, production from which has most likely peaked and will most likely continue to decline. With the Green Pipeline complete, we initiated CO2 injections at Oyster Bayou Field (Phase 8) and Hastings Fields (Phase 7) during June 2010 and December 2010, respectively. We currently anticipate tertiary production responses at both Hastings and Oyster Bayou Fields in late 2011 or early 2012, depending on the date of completion of our CO2 recycle facilities at those fields. We recently received the regulatory approvals required to commence construction of the CO2 recycling facilities at Hastings and Oyster Bayou Fields, which we had been waiting on for several months, and we expect to begin construction of these facilities in the first quarter of 2011. During 2010, operating costs for our tertiary properties averaged $22.21 per Bbl, higher than the prior years average of $21.67 per Bbl. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the operating costs on our tertiary properties averaged $22.26 per Bbl as compared to $22.03 per Bbl in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $22.54 per Bbl during the third quarter of 2010. Our per barrel costs in 2010 are higher than in 2009 due primarily to the higher cost of CO2 during this period. On a per barrel basis, our cost of CO2 increased by $1.09 per Bbl, from $3.96 per Bbl in 2009 to $5.05 per Bbl in 2010, primarily due to the increase in oil prices to which our CO2 costs are partially tied. Our single highest cost for our tertiary operations is our cost for fuel and utilities, which averaged $5.93 per Bbl in 2010, $5.76 per Bbl in 2009 and $5.39 per Bbl in 2008, which has increased on a per barrel basis due to continued expansion of our tertiary floods. For any specific field, we expect our tertiary lease operating expense per BOE to be high initially and then decrease as production increases, ultimately leveling off until production begins to decline in the later life of the field, when lease operating expense per BOE will again increase. Through December 31, 2010, we have invested a total of $2.2 billion in tertiary fields in our Gulf Coast region (including allocated acquisition costs and amounts assigned to goodwill) and have only $5.7 million in unrecovered net cash flow (revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures). Of this total invested amount, approximately $416.0 million (19%) was spent on fields that have yet to have appreciable proved reserves at December 31, 2010 (i.e., fields for which significant incremental proved reserves are anticipated during 2011 and beyond). The proved oil reserves in our tertiary oil fields have a PV 10 Value of $4.2 billion, using the calendar 2010 first day of the month 12 month unweighted average NYMEX pricing of $79.43 per Bbl. These amounts do not include the capital costs or related depreciation and amortization of our CO2 producing properties, but do include CO2 source field lease operating costs and transportation costs. Excluding the Green Pipeline, which currently does not have any proved tertiary revenue associated with it, we have invested a total of $821.6 million in CO2 assets in the Gulf Coast region. 46 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations CO2 Source Field and Tertiary Oil Field Related Capital Budget for 2011. Our current capital spending plans for 2011, net of capitalized interest, include approximately $71 million to be spent in the Jackson Dome area, with the intent to add CO2 reserves and deliverability for future operations, approximately $420 million to be spent in development of our tertiary floods, and approximately $219 million to be spent for our CO2 pipelines, making our combined CO2 related expenditures approximately 65% of our $1.2 billion 2011 capital budget. Operating Results As summarized in the Overview section above, and discussed in further detail below, our operating results decreased from 2008 to 2009, but increased from 2009 to 2010. The operating results for Encore and ENP from March 9, 2010 through December 31, 2010 are included in these results. As we controlled the general partner of ENP until we sold our ownership interests in ENP on December 31, 2010, the operating results of ENP are consolidated with our results of operations, even though we only owned approximately 46% of ENPs common units. The primary factors impacting our operating results were the Encore Merger in 2010, fluctuating commodity prices, changes in the fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts, increases and decreases in production, and the gain on our sale of our interests in Genesis in 2010, which are all explained in more detail below.

(2) Represents pro forma production assuming we had reported the production from the Encore Merger between January 1, 2010, and March 8, 2010. (3) Includes production of Encore and ENP from the March 9, 2010 acquisition date through December 31, 2010, or in the case of non strategic assets disposed, through the date the asset was sold. As outlined in the above table, total production increased 24,628 BOE/d (51%) between 2009 and 2010, and 1,956 BOE/d (4%) between 2008 and 2009. The increase from 2009 to 2010 is due primarily to the additional production from the properties acquired in the Encore Merger, a 19% increase in tertiary oil production, and a full year of production from the Conroe Field acquisition, which closed in December 2009. Offsetting these increases are the Barnett Shale dispositions in 2009. Excluding production from the Barnett Shale properties sold during 2009 and production attributable to the non strategic legacy Encore and ENP properties sold during 2010, production would have averaged 59,273 BOE/d during 2010 and 38,760 BOE/d during 2009, a 53% increase year to year. Assuming a full year of production for the 49 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations acquired Encore properties, our continuing pro forma production (62,558 BOE/d) would have increased 61% rather than 53% over continuing production in 2009. Our production increase between 2008 and 2009 was primarily due to a 26% increase in tertiary oil production and to the February 2009 acquisition of Hastings Field, partially offset by the sale of our Barnett Shale properties and decreases in our Mississippi non CO2 floods. The increase in our tertiary oil production is discussed above under Results of Operations CO2 Operations. The acquisition of Encore in March 2010 added 29,154 BOE/d to our 2010 production. Excluding the non strategic legacy Encore and ENP properties sold during 2010, continuing production attributable to Encore averaged 15,500 BOE/d during 2010. Non tertiary production in the Heidelberg Field decreased in each of the last three years. Production in this area decreased 19% from 2008 to 2009, and further decreased 22% from 2009 to 2010. Most of this decrease is due to depletion and the development of the Heidelberg CO2 flood, which resulted in production being shut in while portions of the field were converted to tertiary operations. When production commences from these CO2 floods, these volumes produced from the CO2 floods will be reported as tertiary oil production for Heidelberg Field. Our production at CCA averaged 9,328 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2010, a decrease of 5% as compared to third quarter 2010 levels due in part to natural production declines. Production from our Bakken properties averaged 5,193 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 12% as compared to third quarter 2010 production levels. The production increases in the Bakken during 2010 are due to the on going drilling and hydraulic fracturing in this area. Overall production for the fourth quarter of 2010 decreased from third quarter 2010 levels due to the sale of the Haynesville and East Texas natural gas properties in early December 2010. The sale of our ownership interests in ENP during December 2010 will further reduce our overall production for the first quarter of 2011. Our production during 2010 was 82% oil as compared to 77% during 2009 and 68% during 2008. These increases are due to the sale of our natural gas rich Barnett Shale properties in the second half of 2009, the acquisition of interests in the oil rich Hastings Field in February 2009, the acquisition of interests in the oil rich Conroe Field in December 2009, and the increase in our tertiary operations, partially offset by the non strategic natural gas properties that we acquired in the Encore Merger and subsequently sold during 2010. Pro forma for the sales of Haynesville and East Texas properties and our interests in ENP, fourth quarter 2010 production would have been 92% oil. 50 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Oil and Natural Gas Revenues Fluctuating commodity prices resulted in a decline in our oil and natural gas revenue between 2008 and 2009, but resulted in a sharp increase between 2009 and 2010. Our increasing production partially offset the revenue decrease from commodity prices between 2008 and 2009 and added to the revenue increase between 2009 and 2010. These changes in revenues, excluding any impact of our derivative contracts, are reflected in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Percentage Percentage Increase Increase Increase Increase in in (Decrease) in (Decrease) in In thousands Revenues Revenues Revenues Revenues Change in revenues due to: Increase in production $ 441,959 51 % $ 53,051 4 % Increase (decrease) in commodity prices 484,624 56 % (533,352 ) (40 %) Total increase (decrease) in revenues $ 926,583 107 % $ (480,301 ) (36 %) Excluding any impact of our derivative contracts, our net realized commodity prices and NYMEX differentials were as follows during 2010, 2009 and 2008: Year ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net Realized Prices: Oil price per Bbl $ 75.97 $ 57.75 $ 92.73 Natural gas price per Mcf 4.63 3.54 8.56 Price per BOE 67.37 49.16 79.42 NYMEX Differentials: Oil per Bbl $ (3.54 ) $ (4.21 ) $ (7.02 ) Natural gas per Mcf 0.23 (0.63 ) (0.33 ) Our Company wide oil NYMEX differential improved during 2010 over our differential in 2009 primarily due to the 2009 sale of our Barnett Shale properties, where the NGL price was significantly below NYMEX oil prices, partially offset by the Rocky Mountain properties we acquired in the Encore Merger which tend to have higher oil differentials than our historical corporate average. Our oil NYMEX differential improved during 2009 over our differential in 2008 primarily due to the overall decrease in oil prices during 2009 and to a lesser extent due to the Barnett Shale properties sold during the year. Our natural gas NYMEX differentials are generally caused by movement in the NYMEX natural gas prices during the month, as most of our natural gas is sold on an index price that is set near the first of each month. While the percentage change in NYMEX natural gas differentials can be quite large, these differentials are very seldom more than a dollar above or below NYMEX prices. 51 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

Changes in commodity prices and the expiration of contracts cause fluctuations in the estimated fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts. Because we do not utilize hedge accounting for our commodity derivative contracts, the changes in fair value of these contracts, as outlined above, are recognized currently in our statements of operations. Production Expenses Lease operating expenses increased by 49% between 2010 and 2009, and by 6% between 2009 and 2008. The increases between 2010 and 2009 were primarily a result of the properties added from the Encore Merger on March 9, 2010, our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations and incremental expense from the acquisition of Conroe Field in December 2009. Although our lease operating expenses increased in absolute dollars between 2009 and 2010, our lease operating expenses on a per BOE basis actually decreased from $18.50 in 2009 to $18.29 in 2010, due primarily to the fact that the properties acquired in the Encore Merger generally had a lower cost per BOE than Denburys legacy properties, offset in part by the sale of our Barnett Shale natural gas assets in 2009, which had a very low cost per BOE. Our lease operating expense per BOE increased from $18.13 in 2008 to $18.50 in 2009 due primarily to the sale of our Barnett Shale assets in 2009, and the acquisition of Hastings Field in February 2009, which had a higher cost per BOE than most of Denburys properties. On a pro forma basis, after adjusting our operating results to remove the production and operating expenses related to ENP and the legacy Encore and Barnett Shale properties sold, Company wide lease operating expenses would have been higher, or $20.32 per BOE during 2010, $21.94 per BOE during 2009 and $23.02 per BOE during 2008. The higher BOE costs are due to those properties sold being 52 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations natural gas properties, which carry a lower per BOE operating cost. Our tertiary operating costs, which have historically been higher than our Company wide operating costs, averaged $22.21 per BOE during 2010, $21.67 per BOE during 2009 and $23.57 per BOE during 2008 (see Results of Operations CO2 Operations for a more detailed discussion). As our tertiary operations become a larger percentage of our total operations, we expect that our operating costs on a per BOE basis will become closer to our tertiary operating costs. Costs of electricity and utilities to operate our properties have increased due primarily to the expansion of our tertiary operations. We expect our tertiary operating costs to partially correlate with oil prices, as the price we pay for CO2 is partially tied to oil prices. Production taxes and marketing expenses generally change in proportion to commodity prices and production volumes, assuming the areas of production are consistent. In 2010, with the acquisition of Encore, our production expanded into several new states in which we had not previously operated. Also, many of those states have higher production tax rates than our historical areas of operation. As such, our production taxes increased 204% between 2009 and 2010, despite our production and revenues increasing less than that percentage. In addition, a portion of Denburys legacy production was taxed at reduced rates (primarily tertiary oil production in Mississippi and Barnett Shale properties), which also contributed to the large increase in production taxes between the two years. The decrease in production taxes between 2008 and 2009 was primarily due to the decrease in commodity prices in 2009 compared to 2008. Marketing, transportation and plant processing fees in 2010 were approximately $26.8 million, 59% higher than 2009 levels due to the addition of properties in other operating areas acquired in the Encore Merger, and were $3.6 million lower in 2009 than 2008 primarily due to the sale of Barnett Shale properties in mid 2009. General and Administrative Expenses During the last three years, general and administrative (GA) expenses have increased on a gross basis but have fluctuated on a per BOE basis as outlined in the following table: Year Ended December 31, In thousands, except per BOE data and employees 2010 2009 2008 Gross cash GA expense $ 232,163 $ 143,886 $ 121,209 Gross stock based compensation 33,926 24,322 16,243 Founders retirement compensation 10,000 Incentive compensation for Genesis management 1,149 14,212 Acquisition expenses, excluding Encore 823 454 527 State franchise taxes 3,855 4,703 3,415 Operator labor and overhead recovery charges (112,160 ) (76,044 ) (68,556 ) Capitalized exploration and development costs (20,074 ) (13,905 ) (12,464 ) Net GA expense $ 139,682 $ 107,628 $ 60,374 GA per BOE: Net cash GA expense $ 3.98 $ 3.27 $ 2.58 Net stock based compensation 1.06 1.16 0.75 Founders retirement compensation 0.57 Incentive compensation for Genesis management 0.04 0.81 Acquisition expenses, excluding Encore 0.03 0.03 0.03 State franchise taxes 0.14 0.27 0.20 Net GA expense $ 5.25 $ 6.11 $ 3.56 Employees as of December 31 1,195 830 797 Gross cash GA expenses increased $88.3 million, or 61%, between 2009 and 2010, and $22.7 million, or 19%, between 2008 and 2009. The increase in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to the Encore Merger, including higher compensation and personnel related costs associated with a 44% increase in the number of employees between the respective year ends, although the employee count during the year 53 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations was even higher as certain Encore legacy employees were performing transition work. In addition, we continued to increase wages as we consider this necessary in order to remain competitive in our industry. Additional third party fees plus office operating expenses attributable to the legacy Encore and new Denbury headquarters office leases, both required due to the Encore Merger, contributed to higher cash GA expense during 2010. During 2009 we increased our employee count by 4% over 2008 levels, although our employee count was higher for part of 2009 before the sale of a portion of our Barnett Shale properties in mid 2009. Stock compensation expense reflected in gross GA expense was $33.9 million during 2010, $24.3 million during 2009 and $16.2 million during 2008, due primarily to the increase in employees and changes in the mix of compensation awarded to employees. The increase in personnel related costs in 2010 was partially offset by the absence during 2010 of the nonrecurring charge associated with the Founders Retirement Agreement for Gareth Roberts, as he retired as CEO and President of the Company on June 30, 2009 and a $13.1 million decrease in charges relating to incentive compensation awards for the management of Genesis. The change of control provision of the Genesis management compensation agreement was triggered concurrent with our sale of Genesis in the first quarter of 2010 with $1.1 million of this being recognized as expense during February 2010 and $14.2 million in 2009. The increase in gross GA expense in each of the last three years was offset in part by an increase in operator overhead recovery charges. Our well operating agreements allow us, when we are the operator, to charge a well with a specified overhead rate during the drilling phase and also to charge a monthly fixed overhead rate for each producing well. As a result of additional operated wells from the Encore Merger and other acquisitions, additional tertiary operations, increased drilling activity, and increased compensation expense, the amount we recovered as operator labor and overhead charges increased by 47% between 2009 and 2010, and 11% between 2008 and 2009. Capitalized exploration and development costs also increased each year, primarily due to additional personnel and increased compensation costs. The net effect of the increases in gross GA expenses, operator overhead recoveries and capitalized exploration costs was a 30% increase in net GA expense between 2009 and 2010, and a 78% increase in net GA expense between 2008 and 2009. On a per BOE basis, net GA expense decreased 14% in 2010 compared to 2009 due to increased production and the lack of non recurring charges in 2009 related to Mr. Roberts and Genesis as discussed above, and increased 72% in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to higher personnel related costs discussed above. Interest and Financing Expenses Year Ended December 31, In thousands, except per BOE data and interest rates 2010 2009 2008 Cash interest expense $ 221,759 $ 108,629 $ 59,955 Non cash interest expense 21,169 7,397 1,802 Less: Capitalized interest (66,815 ) (68,596 ) (29,161 ) Interest expense $ 176,113 $ 47,430 $ 32,596 Interest income and other $ (7,758 ) $ (9,019 ) $ (10,188 ) Net cash interest expense and other income per BOE (1) $ 5.67 $ 2.14 $ 1.59 Average debt outstanding $ 2,736,634 $ 1,265,142 $ 735,288 Average interest rate (2) 8.1 % 8.6 % 8.2 % (1) Cash interest expense less capitalized interest less interest and other income on BOE basis. (2) Includes commitment fees but excludes debt issue costs and amortization of discount or premium. Interest expense increased $128.7 million, or 271%, between 2010 and 2009 and $14.8 million, or 46%, between 2008 and 2009. The increase in interest expense between 2009 and 2010 is due to the increase in our average debt outstanding to finance the Encore Merger which closed in March 2010, a portion of which was repaid during 2010 with proceeds from the asset sales discussed above in Overview Merger with Encore Acquisition Company. Interest capitalized during 2010 was comparable to the 2009 amount due to the continued construction of the Green Pipeline through most of the year. The increase in interest expense between 2008 and 2009 is due primarily to the increase in average debt outstanding, which increased primarily due to the February 2009 issuance of $420 million of 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 54 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations used to repay bank borrowings drawn for, among other things, the Hastings acquisition. The increase is also due to a full year of interest expense recognized during 2009 on the pipeline dropdown transactions with Genesis, compared to only seven months of interest recognized on the dropdowns during 2008. This increase in interest expense between 2008 and 2009 was largely offset by a $39.4 million increase in capitalized interest, primarily relating to interest capitalized on our Green Pipeline. Since the Green Pipeline was placed in service during 2010, interest capitalized should decrease in future periods. See Note 5, Notes Payable and Long Term Indebtedness, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our debt increases resulting from the Encore Merger.

Depletion of oil and natural gas properties increased on both a per BOE basis and in absolute dollars during 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the fact that the properties acquired in the Encore Merger were recorded at fair market value as required by the FASC Business Combinations topic, resulting in a higher rate than our historical DDA rate. In addition, the sale of our Barnett Shale assets in 2009 and acquisition of Conroe Field in late 2009 also increased our DDA rate. Depletion of oil and natural gas properties increased in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to capital spending and increasing costs. Our proved reserves increased to 398 MMBOE at December 31, 2010, from 207.5 MMBOE at December 31, 2009 and 250.5 MMBOE at December 31, 2008. During 2010, we added approximately 344.5 MMBOE of proved reserves (before netting out 2010 production and property sales), and net of property sales we added 217.0 MMBOE of proved reserves. The most significant additions were approximately 217.4 MMBOE from the acquisition of Encore (including 43.0 MMBOE associated with ENP), 39.4 MMBbls added in our tertiary oil operations, 33.4 MMBOE from the development of the Bakken properties, 32.3 MMBOE of natural gas reserves added through the acquisition of Riley Ridge, and 2.9 MMBOE related to commodity price revisions. Our tertiary oil reserves added during 2010 were primarily at Delhi Field (29.5 MMBbls). Correspondingly, we moved approximately $196.1 million from unevaluated properties to the full cost pool relating to Delhi Field, representing the acquisition costs and development expenditures incurred on the field prior to recognizing proved reserves. The decrease in our proved reserves from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 was primarily due to the sale of our Barnett Shale properties in 2009. 55 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Our DDA expense for our CO2 and other fixed assets increased in 2010 and 2009 due primarily to other fixed assets added in the Encore Merger. However, our DDA rate on a per BOE basis decreased approximately 10% between 2009 and 2010, as a result of increased oil and natural gas production volumes as a result of the Encore Merger and a result of the proved CO2 reserves added at Jackson Dome and Riley Ridge in 2010. Our DDA rate for our CO2 and other fixed assets increased approximately 16% between 2008 and 2009, as a result of the Heidelberg CO2 pipeline being placed into service during 2008, expansion of our corporate offices during 2008, and field office expansion during 2009. During the third quarter of 2010, we changed our method of accounting for CO2 properties and recorded a one time, non cash net reduction of $9.6 million ($6.0 million after tax) to DDA expense for the period, which reflects the cumulative impact of the revised accounting policy on our historical financials. See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this change. Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation. As a result of depressed oil and natural gas prices at December 31, 2008, we recorded our first full cost ceiling test write down in a decade, resulting in expense of $226.0 million or $13.32 per BOE at December 31, 2008. The SEC adopted major revisions to its rules governing oil and gas company reporting requirements which were effective beginning on December 31, 2009. Under these new rules, the full cost ceiling value is calculated using a 12 month average price based on the first day price of every month price during the period. We did not have a ceiling test write down during either 2009 or 2010. However, if oil prices were to decrease significantly in subsequent periods, we may be required to record additional write downs under the full cost pool ceiling test in the future. The possibility and amount of any future write down is difficult to predict, and will depend upon oil and natural gas prices, the incremental proved reserves that may be added each period, revisions to previous estimates of reserves and future capital expenditures, and additional capital spent. Encore Transaction and Other Costs The FASC Business Combinations topic requires that all transaction costs (advisory, legal, accounting, due diligence, integration, third party fees, etc.) be expensed as incurred. We recognized a total of $92.3 million of transaction and other costs during 2010 associated with the Encore Merger, including $43.8 million related to severance costs. Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, Amounts in thousands, except per BOE amounts and tax rates 2010 2009 2008 Current income tax expense $ 33,194 $ 4,611 $ 40,812 Deferred income tax expense (benefit) 160,349 (51,644 ) 195,020 Total income tax expense (benefit) $ 193,543 $ (47,033 ) $ 235,832 Average income tax expense (benefit) per BOE $ 7.27 $ (2.67 ) $ 13.90 Effective tax rate 40.4 % 38.5 % 37.8 % Total net deferred tax liability $ (1,520,538 ) $ (469,195 ) $ (522,234 ) Our income tax provision for each of the last three years has been based on an estimated statutory rate of approximately 38%. Our effective tax rate has generally been slightly lower than our estimated statutory rate due to the impact of certain items such as our domestic production activities deduction, offset in part by compensation arising from certain equity compensation that cannot be deducted for tax purposes in the same manner as book expense. Our 2010 effective tax rate was higher, however, compared to our statutory rate due to the recognition of additional net tax expense on the revaluation of our deferred taxes at the date of the Encore Merger and as a result of our legal entity restructuring at December 31, 2010. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the current income tax expense represents our anticipated alternative minimum cash taxes that we cannot offset with enhanced oil recovery credits, as well as state income taxes. The significant increase in our total net deferred tax liability in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to the Encore Merger, in which Encores net deferred tax liability and tax attributes carried over to us. During 2010, we were able to deduct approximately $1.0 billion of Section 193 (tertiary injectant) deductions 56 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (see following paragraph), primarily related to the Green Pipeline going into service, but these deductions were almost completely offset by gains related to the 2010 property sales. As of December 31, 2010, we had an estimated $39.8 million of enhanced oil recovery credits, including those of Encore, to carry forward that can be utilized to reduce our current income taxes during 2011 or future years. These enhanced oil recovery credits do not begin to expire until 2024. Since the ability to earn additional enhanced oil recovery credits is based upon the level of oil prices, we would not currently expect to earn additional enhanced oil recovery credits unless oil prices were to decrease significantly from current levels. In the third quarter of 2008, we obtained approval from the National Office of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to change our method of tax accounting for certain assets used in our tertiary oilfield recovery operations. As a result of the approved change in method of tax accounting, beginning with the 2007 tax year we began to deduct, rather than capitalize, such costs for tax purposes, and applied for tax refunds associated with such change for our 2004 and 2006 tax years. Notwithstanding its consent to our change in tax accounting in 2008, the IRS recently exercised its prerogative to challenge the tax accounting method we used. In late January 2011, we received a Technical Advice Memorandum (TAM) issued by the IRS National Office disapproving our method of accounting and revoking its consent to our change, on a prospective basis only, commencing January 1, 2011. Henceforth, beginning with the 2011 tax year, we will return to capitalizing and depreciating the costs of these assets for tax purposes. As a result of the prospective nature of the IRSs determination, there should be no change in our position with respect to the deductibility of these costs for 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. However, refund claims of $10.6 million for tax years through 2006 are pending and are subject to review by the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress. We are unable to assess the outcome of any such review, nor how that outcome may affect the other years covered by the TAM. The current administration in Washington D.C. is attempting to remove many tax incentives for the oil and gas industry. Those items that would have the most significant impact on us would include the loss of the domestic manufacturing deduction as well as the repeal of the immediate expensing of intangible drilling costs and tertiary injectant costs. It is uncertain whether or not the current administration will be successful in changing the laws, but if they were successful, it would likely increase the amount of cash taxes that we pay. Should cash taxes increase significantly, it could impact our forecasted 2011 capital expenditure budget. Per BOE Data The following table summarizes our cash flow, DDA and results of operations on a per BOE basis for the comparative periods. Each of the individual components is discussed above.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Management Debt We finance some of our acquisitions and other expenditures with fixed and variable rate debt. These debt agreements expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2010, we did not have any outstanding borrowings on our bank credit facility. None of our existing debt has any triggers or covenants regarding our debt ratings with rating agencies, although under the NEJD financing lease with Genesis, in the event of significant downgrades of our corporate credit rating by the rating agencies, Genesis can require certain credit enhancements from us, and possibly other remedies under the lease. The fair value of our senior subordinated debt is based on quoted market prices.

Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Contracts From time to time, we enter into various oil and natural gas derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. These contracts have consisted of price floors, collars and fixed price swaps. The production that we hedge has varied from year to year depending on our levels of debt and financial strength and expectation of future commodity prices. We currently employ a strategy to hedge a portion of our forecasted production 12 to 15 months in advance, as we believe it is important to protect our future cash flow for a short period of time in order to give us time to adjust to commodity price fluctuations, particularly since many of our expenditures have long lead times. See Note 9, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our commodity derivative contracts. All of the mark to market valuations used for our oil and natural gas derivatives are provided by external sources. We manage and control market and counterparty credit risk through established internal control procedures that are reviewed on an ongoing basis. We attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies, monitoring procedures, and diversification. All of our commodity derivative contracts are with parties that are lenders under our revolving credit agreement. We have included an estimate of nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts, which we have measured for nonperformance risk based upon credit default swaps or credit spreads. 58 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations For accounting purposes, we do not apply hedge accounting to our oil and natural gas derivative contracts. This means that any changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion to earnings. At December 31, 2010, our derivative contracts were recorded at their fair value, which was a net liability of approximately $44.0 million (excluding $26.7 million of deferred premiums that Denbury is obligated to pay for its derivative contracts, which payments are not subject to changes in commodity prices), a significant change from the $128.7 million net liability recorded at December 31, 2009. This change is primarily related to the expiration of oil derivative contracts during 2010, and to the oil and natural gas futures prices as of December 31, 2010, in relation to the new commodity derivative contracts we entered into during 2010 for future periods. Commodity Derivative Sensitivity Analysis Based on NYMEX crude oil and natural gas futures prices as of December 31, 2010, and assuming both a 10% increase and decrease thereon, we would expect to make or receive payments on our crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts as shown in the following table: Crude Oil Natural Gas Derivative Derivative Contracts Contracts Receipt/ Receipt/ In thousands (Payment) (Payment) Based on: NYMEX futures prices as of December 31, 2010 $ (7,304 ) $ 43,713 10% increase in prices (61,792 ) 32,395 10% decrease in prices (1,877 ) 55,047 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we select certain accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments regarding the application of those policies. Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements. Full Cost Method of Accounting, Depletion and Depreciation and Oil and Natural Gas Properties Businesses involved in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. We apply the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Another acceptable method of accounting for oil and gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting. In general, the primary differences between the two methods are related to the capitalization of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment. Under the full cost method, all geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool, whereas under the successful efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred. In the assessment of impairment of oil and gas properties, the successful efforts method follows the FASB guidance under the Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets topic of the FASC, under which the net book value of assets is measured for impairment against the undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method, the full cost pool (net book value of oil and gas properties) is measured against future cash flows discounted at 10% using the average first day of the month oil and natural gas price for each month during the 12 month period ended as of each quarterly reporting period. The financial results for a given period could be substantially different depending on the method of accounting that an oil and gas entity applies. Further, we do not designate our oil and natural gas derivative contracts as hedge instruments for accounting purposes under the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the FASC (see below), and as a result, these contracts are not considered in the full cost ceiling test. 59 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We make significant estimates at the end of each period related to accruals for oil and gas revenues, production, capitalized costs and operating expenses. We calculate these estimates with our best available data, which includes, among other things, production reports, price posting, information compiled from daily drilling reports and other internal tracking devices, and analysis of historical results and trends. While management is not aware of any required revisions to its estimates, there will likely be future adjustments resulting from such things as changes in ownership interests, payouts, joint venture audits, re allocations by the purchaser/pipeline, or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and natural gas industry, many of which will require retroactive application. These types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated or determined and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs. Under full cost accounting, the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom used to perform the full cost ceiling test have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible, including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare reported estimates, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statement disclosures. Over the last four years, Denburys annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately 1.4% of the previous years estimates and have been both positive and negative. Changes in commodity prices also affect our reserve quantities. Between 2008 and 2009, commodity prices increased, resulting in an increase in our proved reserves of 4.2 MMBOE. This trend continued between 2009 and 2010, resulting in an additional increase in our proved reserves of 2.9 MMBOE. These changes in quantities affect our DDA rate, and the combined effect of changes in quantities and commodity prices impacts our full cost ceiling test calculation. For example, we estimate that a 5% increase in our estimate of proved reserves quantities would have lowered our fourth quarter 2010 DDA rate from $15.87 per BOE to approximately $15.20 per BOE, and a 5% decrease in our proved reserve quantities would have increased our DDA rate to approximately $16.61 per BOE. Also, reserve quantities and their ultimate values, determined solely by our banks, are the primary factors in determining the borrowing base under our bank credit facility and in measuring certain covenants of our senior debt. Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation. The net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties are limited to the lower of unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling. The cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of (1) the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves before future abandonment costs (discounted at 10%), based on unescalated period end oil and natural gas prices during 2008 and for the first three quarters of 2009; and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, the average first day of the month oil and natural gas price for each month during the 12 month periods ended December 31, 2009 and 2010; (2) plus the cost of properties not being amortized; (3) plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, if any; (4) less related income tax effects. Our future net revenues from proved reserves are not reduced for development costs related to the cost of drilling for and developing CO2 reserves nor for those related to the cost of constructing CO2 pipelines, as those costs have already been incurred by the Company. Therefore, we include in the ceiling test, as a reduction of future net revenues, that portion of the Companys capitalized CO2 costs related to CO2 reserves and CO2 pipelines that we estimate will be consumed in the process of producing our proved oil and natural gas reserves. The fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts is not included in the ceiling test, as we do not designate these contracts as hedge instruments for accounting purposes. The cost center ceiling test is prepared quarterly. We did not have a full cost pool ceiling test write down in 2009 or 2010. However, during 2008, commodity prices were volatile, with oil NYMEX prices moving from $95.98 per Bbl at December 31, 2007, to $140.00 per Bbl at June 30, 2008, then down to $44.60 per Bbl at December 31, 2008. Likewise, natural gas NYMEX prices went from $7.48 per Mcf as of December 31, 2007, to $13.35 per Mcf at June 30, 2008, and down to $5.62 per Mcf as of December 31, 2008. Because of the 54% decrease in NYMEX oil price and 25% decrease in NYMEX 60 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations natural gas price between year end 2007 and year end 2008, we recognized a full cost pool ceiling test write down during 2008 of $226.0 million, or $13.32 per BOE. Commodity prices increased throughout 2009 and 2010, with NYMEX oil prices at $91.38 per barrel, and NYMEX natural gas prices at $4.41 per Mcf, at December 31, 2010. Commodity prices have historically been volatile and are expected to be in the future. If oil and natural gas should again decrease, we may be required to record additional write downs due to the full cost ceiling test. The amount of any future write down is difficult to predict and will depend upon the oil and natural gas prices utilized in the ceiling test, the incremental proved reserves that might be added during each period and additional capital spent. Tertiary Injection Costs Our tertiary operations are conducted in reservoirs that have already produced significant amounts of oil over many years; however, in accordance with the rules for recording proved reserves, we cannot recognize proved reserves associated with enhanced recovery techniques such as CO2 injection, until there is a production response to the injected CO2, or unless the field is analogous to an existing flood. Our costs associated with the CO2 we produce (or acquire) and inject are principally our costs of production, transportation and acquisition, and to pay royalties. We capitalize, as a development cost, injection costs in fields that are in their development stage, which means we have not yet seen incremental oil production due to the CO2 injections (i.e., a production response). These capitalized development costs will be included in our unevaluated property costs if there are not already proved tertiary reserves in that field. After we see a production response to the CO2 injections (i.e., the production stage), injection costs will be expensed as incurred and any previously deferred unevaluated development costs will become subject to depletion upon recognition of proved tertiary reserves. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we capitalized $20.5 million, $8.0 million and $10.4 million, respectively, of tertiary injection costs associated with our tertiary projects. Income Taxes We make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. Our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes, tax credits, and net operating loss carryforwards. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns. Further, we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets (primarily our enhanced oil recovery credits and state loss carryforwards). If recovery is not likely, we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover, which would result in an increase to our income tax expense. As of December 31, 2010, we believe that all of our deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet will ultimately be recovered. If our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not likely. A 1% increase in our effective tax rate would have increased our calculated income tax expense (benefit) by approximately $4.8 million, $(1.2) million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 6, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and see Income Taxes above for further information concerning our income taxes. Fair Value Estimates The FASC defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. It does not require us to make any new fair value measurements, but rather establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy, as they represent observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the reporting date, while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority, as they represent unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. See Note 10, Fair Value Measurements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures regarding our recurring fair value measurements. 61 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Significant uses of fair value measurements include: allocation of the purchase price paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in those acquisitions, assessment of impairment of long lived assets, assessment of impairment of goodwill, and recorded value of derivative instruments. Acquisitions Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The FASC Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (often referred to as the exit price). A fair value measurement is based on the assumptions of market participants and not those of the reporting entity. Therefore, entity specific intentions do not impact the measurement of fair value unless those assumptions are consistent with market participant views. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values involving long term tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and long term asset retirement obligations. The valuation of oil and natural gas properties is even more difficult due to the nature of our core business, enhanced oil recovery operations. In order to appropriately apply the FASC standard, we must estimate what value a third party market participant would place on the acquired property. It is very subjective as to what value another entity would place on the potential barrels recoverable with CO2, which impacts our allocation of the purchase price to goodwill, unevaluated properties and proved properties. Although we find that this standard is difficult to apply in our circumstance, we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third party consultants for assistance. The fair values used to allocate the purchase price of an acquisition are often estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method, which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. Impairment Assessment of Goodwill We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of oil or natural gas, a full cost ceiling write down of oil and natural gas properties, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, significant changes in the expected timing of production, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Denbury applies SEC full cost accounting rules, under which the acquisition cost of oil and gas properties is recognized on a cost center basis (country), of which Denbury has only one cost center (United States). Goodwill is assigned to this single reporting unit. Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing for impairment of our goodwill is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates for goodwill since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include projections of future oil and natural gas prices, projections of estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, projections of future rates of production, timing and amount of future development and operating costs, projected availability and cost of CO2, projected recovery factors of tertiary reserves, and risk adjusted discount rates. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information that we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from those projections. 62 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Contracts We enter into oil and natural gas derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with future oil and natural gas production. These contracts have historically consisted of options, in the form of price floors or collars, and fixed price swaps. We do not designate these derivative commodity contracts as hedge instruments for accounting purposes under the FASC Derivatives and Hedging topic. This means that any changes in the future fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the balance to earnings. While we may experience more volatility in our net income than if we were to apply hedge accounting treatment as permitted by the FASC Derivatives and Hedging topic, we believe that for us the benefits associated with applying hedge accounting do not outweigh the cost, time and effort to comply with hedge accounting. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized expense (income) of $(53.0) million, $383.0 million and $(257.6) million, respectively, related to non cash changes in the fair market value of our derivative contracts. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires us to make other estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reliable, and believe that the ultimate actual results will not differ significantly from those reported; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and such risks and uncertainties could cause the actual results to differ materially from our estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010 29, Business Combinations: Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations (ASU 2010 29), which amends the FASC Business Combinations topic. The update addresses diversity in the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations. If a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. We adopted ASU 2010 29 on January 1, 2011 and will apply the new standard to pro forma disclosures for acquisitions occurring after January 2, 2011. We have reviewed recently issued accounting standards that are not yet effective and have determined that none would have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward Looking Information The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements found in the sections entitled Business and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are forward looking statements, as that term is defined in Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be or may concern, among other things, forecasted capital expenditures, drilling activity or methods including the timing and location thereof, acquisition plans and proposals and dispositions, development activities, cost savings, capital budgets, production rates and volumes or forecasts thereof, hydrocarbon reserve quantities and values, CO2 reserves, potential reserves, percentages of recoverable original oil in place, hydrocarbon prices, pricing or cost assumptions based on current and projected oil and gas prices, liquidity, cash flows, availability of capital, borrowing capacity, regulatory matters, prospective legislation affecting the oil and gas industry, mark to market values, competition, long term forecasts of production, finding costs, rates of return, estimated costs, or changes in costs, future capital expenditures and overall economics and other variables surrounding our operations and future plans. Such forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as plan, estimate, expect, predict, anticipate, projected, should, assume, believe, target or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Such forward looking information is based upon managements current plans, expectations, estimates and assumptions and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect current plans, anticipated actions, the timing of such actions and the Companys financial condition and results of operations. As a consequence, actual results may differ materially from expectations, estimates or assumptions expressed in or implied by any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are: fluctuations of the prices received or demand for the Companys oil and natural gas; effects of our indebtedness; 63 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations success of our risk management techniques; inaccurate cost estimates; availability of and fluctuations in the prices of goods and services; the uncertainty of drilling results and reserve estimates; operating hazards; disruption of operations and damages from hurricanes or tropical storms; acquisition risks; requirements for capital or its availability; conditions in the financial and credit markets; general economic conditions; competition and government regulations; and unexpected delays, as well as the risks and uncertainties inherent in oil and gas drilling and production activities or which are otherwise discussed in this annual report, including, without limitation, the portions referenced above, and the uncertainties set forth from time to time in the Companys other public reports, filings and public statements. 64 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
