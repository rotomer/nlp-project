Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Our discussion and analysis includes forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with Risk Factors under Item 1A of this report, along with Forward Looking Information at the end of this section for information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than our forward looking statements. Overview We are a growing independent oil and natural gas company. We are the largest combined oil and natural gas producer in both Mississippi and Montana, own the largest CO2 reserves used for tertiary oil recovery east of the Mississippi River, and hold significant operating acreage in the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast regions. Our goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction practices, with the most significant emphasis on our CO2 tertiary recovery operations. We completed the acquisition of Encore on March 9, 2010 (the Encore Merger), and during the remainder of 2010 executed on our plan to divest non strategic Encore properties. The magnitude of the Encore acquisition and subsequent 2010 asset divestitures impacts the comparability of our 2010 and 2011 financial results in many ways, including oil and natural gas production, revenues and operating expenses. Our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2010 include the results of operations of Encore from the date of the acquisition through December 31, 2010, and were further impacted by our divestitures of non strategic Encore properties and our ownership interests in Encore Energy Partners (ENP) between May 2010 and December 31, 2010. 2011 Operating Highlights. We achieved record net income and cash flows from operations in 2011. We had net income of $573.3 million, or $1.45 per basic common share, during 2011, compared to net income of $271.7 million, or $0.73 per basic common share, during 2010. The increase between the two periods is primarily attributable to a $475.9 million increase in oil and natural gas revenues due to higher oil prices, partially offset by lower production as a result of assets sold in late 2010, and to a lesser extent due to an $87.9 million decrease in costs related to the Encore Merger. These increases to net income between 2010 and 2011 were offset by the absence in 2011 of a $101.5 million gain on the 2010 sale of Genesis Energy, LLC, and to a lesser extent were due to a $16.1 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt in 2011, certain asset impairment charges in 2011 related to our investment in Vanguard common units ($6.3 million), and the abandonment of our investment in certain CO2 properties ($16.6 million). Overall, our total expenses decreased by $57.4 million, from $1.44 billion in 2010 to $1.39 billion in 2011. Our cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion in 2011, compared to $855.8 million in 2010, the increase also primarily due to the increase in oil revenues. During 2011, our oil and natural gas production, which was 93% oil, averaged 65,660 BOE/d, compared to 72,927 BOE/d produced during 2010. The decrease in production is primarily attributable to the 2010 sales of non strategic legacy Encore assets and our ownership interests in ENP. See Results of Operations Operating Results Production for more information. Oil prices during 2011 were considerably higher than prices during 2010, with NYMEX oil prices averaging $95.08 per Bbl in 2011, compared to average NYMEX prices of $79.51 per Bbl in 2010. Oil revenues made up approximately 98% of our oil and natural gas revenues in 2011 as compared to approximately 93% in 2010. Our average price per barrel of oil, excluding the impact of derivative contracts, was $100.03 per barrel in 2011, as compared to $75.97 per barrel in 2010, a 32% increase between the two periods. Oil prices received in 2011 were positively impacted by the favorable price differential for crude oil sold under Louisiana Light Sweet (LLS) pricing. See Results of Operations Operating Results Oil and Natural Gas Revenues below for more information. August 2011 Acquisition of Remaining Working Interest in Riley Ridge. On August 1, 2011, we acquired the remaining 57.5% working interest that we did not already own in the Riley Ridge Federal Unit (Riley Ridge), the remaining 57.5% interest in the associated Riley Ridge gas plant, along with interests in certain surrounding acreage. The purchase price after closing adjustments was $214.8 million. Riley Ridge not only contains significant natural gas and helium, but is strategic to our tertiary oil field development in the Rocky Mountain region as it provides a significant long term source of CO2 that we plan to use in our tertiary floods. We currently expect the gas plant to be operational with the first production of natural gas and helium during the second quarter of 2012. The CO2 will be re injected into the reservoir until we have completed an additional separation facility and a CO2 pipeline to the field, which is expected to be completed in 2016. As of December 31, 2011, Riley Ridge and minor surrounding acreage contained net proved reserves of 415 Bcf of natural gas and 2.2 Tcf of CO2 reserves. The CO2 reserve estimates are based on the gross working interest of the CO2 reserves, of which Denburys net revenue interest is approximately 1.6 Tcf. The helium reserves at Riley Ridge are owned by the U.S. government; however, we have the rights to produce and sell the helium reserves on behalf of the government in exchange for a fee. As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that Riley Ridge contains proved helium reserves of 12.0 Bcf, net of fees to be remitted to the U.S. government. 34 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Addition of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves. We added 88.0 MMBOE of estimated proved reserves during 2011, including 48.2 MMBOE from the development of Bakken properties, 237 Bcf (39.5 MMBOE) of natural gas reserves from the Riley Ridge acquisition completed in August 2011, which is discussed above, and minor revisions to other properties. Recent Common Share Repurchase Program. In October 2011, we commenced a common share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors for up to $500 million of Denbury common shares. Between early October 2011 and December 31, 2011, we repurchased 14,112,610 shares of Denbury common stock (approximately 3.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock at September 30, 2011) for $195.2 million, or $13.83 per share. The program has no pre established ending date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any dollar amount or specific number of shares of its common stock under the program. Pending 2012 Non Core Gulf Coast Assets Divestiture. In January 2012, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain non core assets primarily located in central and southern Mississippi and in southern Louisiana for $155 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. The sale is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close by late February 2012, with an effective date of December 1, 2011. Production associated with the properties to be sold averaged 1,805 BOE/d during 2011. See Note 14, Subsequent Events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital Resources and Liquidity We currently estimate our 2012 capital spending will be approximately $1.35 billion, net of estimated equipment leases ($75 million) and excluding capitalized interest and start up costs associated with new tertiary floods. Our current 2012 capital budget includes the following: $365 million allocated for tertiary oil field expenditures, $400 million for development of our Bakken properties, $325 million for pipeline construction, $150 million to be spent on CO2 sources, and $110 million to be spent in all other areas. When we originally set our capital budget in late 2011, based on oil and natural gas commodity futures prices at that time and our 2012 production forecasts, we estimated that our capital budget (including capitalized interest and tertiary start up costs) could be around $200 million greater than our 2012 anticipated cash flow from operations. Recent increases in oil prices, if they remain, will likely increase our anticipated cash flow from operations and significantly reduce the amount by which we expected to outspend cash flow. In light of this, we are considering an increase in our 2012 capital budget. We plan to fund any shortfall between our cash flow from operations and our capital spending with asset divestitures ranging from $150 million to $300 million in the aggregate or, if necessary, borrowings under our bank credit facility. In January 2012, we received net proceeds of $83.5 million from the sale of our Vanguard common units, and we anticipate receiving proceeds of approximately $155 million from the sale of non core Gulf Coast assets in late February 2012 (see Pending 2012 Non Core Gulf Coast Assets Divestiture above). We are also marketing one other non core property that we expect to sell later in 2012. Based on our transactions in early 2012, we expect that we will achieve our targeted cash inflows from asset divestitures. As discussed above, in October 2011 we commenced a common share repurchase program for up to $500 million of Denbury shares. Our goal for 2012 is to limit any incremental debt incurred for such repurchases and for our 2012 capital budget to $250 million or less, and we estimate cumulative share repurchases of up to $250 million in determining our 2012 capital budget. Of the $250 million in projected repurchases, thus far we have repurchased $195.2 million. Based on our current anticipated levels of cash flows from operations and proceeds from asset sales, we currently expect to stay within our stated goal for incremental debt related to our share repurchase program and 2012 capital budget. Our share repurchases will be determined based on various parameters; therefore, our share repurchases may be less or more than our estimated $250 million. During 2011, we extended the maturity of our bank credit facility from March 2014 to May 2016. As part of our semiannual bank review, on September 1, 2011, our borrowing base for our bank credit facility was reaffirmed at $1.6 billion. Our next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for May 1, 2012; we currently do not anticipate any reduction in our borrowing base as part of that redetermination, as we believe that we have more than enough collateral for the current borrowing base, based on current commodity prices and our proved asset base. As of February 23, 2012, we had $470 million of bank debt outstanding on our $1.6 billion bank credit facility and estimated cash of $195 million, leaving us significant liquidity to fund any cash shortfall for capital expenditures. To help protect our cash flows in case commodity prices were to decrease significantly from the levels of futures strip prices near the end of February 2012, we currently have oil and natural gas derivative commodity contracts in place through the third quarter of 2013. Our oil derivative commodity contracts cover approximately 8590% of our anticipated proved oil production in 2012 and 7580% in the first three quarters of 2013. Over 90% of our continuing production (excluding production from properties sold) is oil, and most of our oil contracts are costless collars with NYMEX floor prices between $70 and $80 per Bbl. See Note 9, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the prices and volumes of our commodity derivative contracts. 35 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We continually monitor our capital spending and anticipated cash flows and believe that we can adjust our capital spending up or down depending on cash flows; however, any such reduction in capital spending could reduce our anticipated production levels in future years. For 2012 and some future years, we have contracted for certain capital expenditures; therefore, we cannot eliminate all of our capital commitments without penalties. (See Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Commitments and Obligations for further information regarding these commitments.) In February 2011, we issued, at par, $400 million of 6% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021. The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to partially fund the repurchase of $525 million in principal amount of our outstanding 7% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 and 7% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015. During 2011, we recognized $16.1 million of loss associated with the debt repurchases included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations under the caption Loss on early extinguishment of debt. See Note 5, Long Term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the debt issuance and related tender offers. Capital Expenditure Summary. The following table summarizes our capital expenditures by project area. Amounts include capitalized tertiary start up costs and accrued capital expenditures: Year Ended December 31, In thousands 2011 2010 2009 Capital expenditures by project: Tertiary oil fields $ 522,007 $ 371,274 $ 229,532 Bakken 435,159 108,363 CO2 pipelines 134,377 171,511 514,035 CO2 properties 103,541 73,316 61,921 Other areas 244,055 156,076 59,615 Capital expenditures before acquisitions and capitalized interest 1,439,139 880,540 865,103 Less: recoveries from sale/leaseback transactions (70,332) (40,490) (49,313) Net capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and capitalized interest 1,368,807 840,050 815,790 Acquisitions: Oil and natural gas property acquisitions 35,305 25,672 621,517 Consideration for Encore Merger(1) 2,952,515 Consideration for Riley Ridge acquisitions 214,779 132,257 Capitalized interest 61,586 66,815 68,596 Capital expenditures, net of sale/leaseback transactions $ 1,680,477 $ 4,017,309 $ 1,505,903 (1) Consideration given in Encore Merger includes $2.09 billion for the fair value of Denbury common stock issued. Our 2011 capital expenditures, excluding the Riley Ridge acquisition, were funded with $1.2 billion of cash flow from operations and cash on hand at the beginning of the period. The Riley Ridge acquisition was funded with incremental bank debt. Our 2010 capital expenditures, excluding the Encore acquisition, were funded with $855.8 million of cash flow from operations and incremental cash generated from the sale of non strategic assets. Net cash used to acquire Encore was approximately $815 million, which was funded with incremental debt drawn under our bank credit facility as discussed in Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our 2009 capital expenditures were funded with $530.6 million of cash flow from operations, $516.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties, $381.4 million in net proceeds from the February 2009 issuance of senior subordinated debt, $168.7 million from the issuance of 11,620,000 shares of our common stock as partial consideration for the acquisition of Conroe Field and $50.0 million in net bank borrowings. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Commitments and Obligations. At December 31, 2011, our largest contractual payment obligation that is not on our balance sheet relates to our operating leases, which primarily relate to the lease financing of certain equipment for CO2 recycling facilities at our tertiary oil fields. Remaining lease payments for these operating leases totaled $247.2 million at year end 2011. We also have several leases relating to office space and other minor equipment leases. At December 31, 2011, we had a total of $16.5 million of letters of credit outstanding under our bank credit 36 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations facility. Additionally, we have obligations that are not currently recorded on our balance sheet relating to various obligations for development and exploratory expenditures that arise from our normal capital expenditure program or from other transactions common to our industry. In addition, in order to recover our undeveloped proved reserves, we must also fund the associated future development costs estimated in our proved reserve reports and asset retirement obligations. For a further discussion of our future development costs, see the contractual obligations table below. Under the Hastings Field acquisition agreement, we are committed to inject an average of at least 50 MMcf/d of CO2 (total of purchased and recycled) in the West Hastings Unit for the 90 day period prior to January 1, 2013. CO2 injections commenced in December 2010, and we are currently injecting volumes in excess of 50 MMcf/d. Additionally, we are required to make aggregate cumulative capital expenditures in this field through December 31, 2014, which are included in Other obligations in the table below. For a complete description of these arrangements, including penalties for failure to meet these contractual commitments, see Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. CO2 Purchase Commitments. We have entered into long term contracts to purchase man made CO2 from eleven proposed plants or sources that will emit large volumes of CO2, six of which are in the Gulf Coast region, four in the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky), and one in the Rocky Mountain region. Two of the eleven projects are currently under construction, while construction of the remaining plants is either pending financing from federal grants or loan guarantees, or has been delayed due to economic or other reasons. We anticipate the two projects that are currently under construction, together with our long term purchase commitment to purchase CO2 from two existing facilities in Wyoming, ExxonMobils LaBarge facility and Lost Cabin, will provide us with approximately 200 MMcf/d to 375 MMcf/d of CO2. We expect to begin taking CO2 from ExxonMobils LaBarge facility during the second half of 2012, the Lost Cabin Gas Plant in late 2012 or early 2013, and the two plants currently under construction in 2013 or 2014. Anticipated payments for these long term commitments are included in Other obligations in the contractual commitments table below. The remaining contracts for man made CO2 have been excluded from the contractual commitments table since they are cancelable, and construction has not yet begun on any of these plants. While various pre construction steps for certain of the plants continue, there is some doubt as to whether they will be constructed at all. While it is likely that not every plant currently under contract will be constructed, there are other plants we have under consideration from time to time that could provide CO2 to us that would either supplement or replace some of the CO2 volumes from the proposed plants for which we currently have CO2 output purchase contracts, and we have had ongoing discussions with several of these other potential sources. If all nine of the remaining plants were constructed, these combined CO2 sources would provide us with estimated aggregate CO2 volumes of 1.4 Bcf/d to 2.3 Bcf/d, although we estimate the earliest that this source of man made CO2 would become available to us is 2014. The base price of CO2 per Mcf from these CO2 sources varies by plant and location, but is generally higher than our most recent all in cost of CO2 from Jackson Dome using current oil prices. Prices for CO2 delivered from these projects are expected to be competitive with the cost of our natural CO2 after adjusting for our share of potential carbon emissions reduction credits using estimated futures prices of carbon emissions reduction credits. If all nine of the remaining plants are constructed, the aggregate purchase obligation for this CO2 is currently estimated to be approximately $215 to $390 million per year, assuming a $100 per Bbl NYMEX oil price, before any potential savings from our share of carbon emissions reduction credits. All of the contracts have price adjustments that fluctuate based on the price of oil. A summary of our obligations at December 31, 2011, is presented in the following table: Payments Due by Period In thousands 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations: Bank Credit Agreement(1) $ $ $ $ $ 385,000 $ $ 385,000 Estimated interest payments on Bank Credit Agreement and subordinated debt(1) 178,704 178,704 178,656 178,623 124,954 375,023 1,214,664 Subordinated debt(1) 1,072 485 651,270 1,398,523 2,051,350 Pipeline lease obligations(2) 30,689 32,469 34,036 31,847 30,912 344,233 504,186 Operating lease obligations 36,207 37,509 34,369 33,536 31,349 74,269 247,239 Capital lease obligations 2,206 1,447 664 106 106 510 5,039 Other obligations(3) 284,898 119,380 136,569 93,148 93,034 1,039,298 1,766,327 Derivative contracts payment(4) 26,523 18,872 45,395 Other Cash Commitments: Future development costs on proved oil and gas reserves, net of other obligations(5) 496,666 665,879 527,201 579,962 309,247 92,811 2,671,766 Future development cost on proved CO2 reserves, net of other obligations(6) 7,020 13,000 11,000 20,000 76,000 127,020 Asset retirement obligations(7) 4,876 1,342 517 4,766 12,361 254,621 278,483 Total $ 1,067,789 $ 1,068,602 $ 924,084 $ 942,473 $ 1,638,233 $ 3,655,288 $ 9,296,469 37 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (1) These long term borrowings and related interest payments are further discussed in Note 5, Long Term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This table assumes that our long term debt is held until maturity. (2) Represents estimated future cash payments under a long term transportation service agreement for the Free State Pipeline and future minimum cash payments in a 20 year financing lease for the NEJD pipeline system. Both transactions were entered into during 2008 and are being accounted for as financing leases. The payment required for the Free State Pipeline is variable based upon the amount of the CO2 we ship through the pipeline, and the commitment amounts disclosed above for that financing lease are computed based upon our internal forecasts. Approximately $261 million of these payments, in the aggregate, represent interest. See Note 5, Long Term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Represents future cash commitments under contracts in place as of December 31, 2011, primarily for pipe, pipeline construction contracts, anthropogenic CO2 contracts, drilling rig services and well related costs. As is common in our industry, we commit to make certain expenditures on a regular basis as part of our ongoing development and exploration program. These commitments generally relate to projects that occur during the subsequent several months and are usually part of our normal operating expenses or part of our capital budget, which for 2012 is currently set at $1.35 billion, exclusive of acquisitions. In certain cases we have the ability to terminate contracts for equipment, in which case we would be liable only for the cost incurred by the vendor up to that point; however, as we currently do not anticipate cancelling those contracts, these amounts include our estimated payments under those contracts. We also have recurring expenditures for such things as accounting, engineering and legal fees; software maintenance; subscriptions; and other overhead type items. Normally these expenditures do not change materially on an aggregate basis from year to year and are part of our general and administrative expenses. We have not attempted to estimate the amounts of these types of recurring expenditures in this table, as most could be quickly cancelled with regard to any specific vendor, even though the expense itself may be required for ongoing normal operations of the Company. (4) Represents the fair value of our derivative liabilities as of December 31, 2011. The ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative obligations are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk. See further discussion of our derivative contracts and their market price sensitivities in Market Risk Management below in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in Note 9, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (5) Represents projected capital costs as scheduled in our December 31, 2011, proved reserve report that are necessary in order to recover our proved oil and natural gas reserves. These are not contractual commitments and are net of any other capital obligations shown under Contractual Obligations in the table above. (6) Represents projected capital costs that are necessary in order to recover our proved CO2 reserves from our CO2 source wells used to produce CO2 for our tertiary operations. These are not contractual commitments and are net of any other capital obligations shown above. (7) Represents the estimated future asset retirement obligations on an undiscounted basis. The present discounted asset retirement obligation is $93.5 million, as determined under the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations topic of the FASC, and is further discussed in Note 3, Asset Retirement Obligations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have long term contracts that require us to deliver CO2 to industrial CO2 customers at various contracted prices, plus we have a CO2 delivery obligation pursuant to three volumetric production payments (VPPs). Based upon the maximum amounts deliverable as stated in the industrial contracts and the VPPs, we estimate that we may be obligated to deliver up to 327 Bcf of CO2 to these customers over the next 14 years; however, since the group as a whole has historically taken less CO2 than the maximum allowed in their contracts, based on the current level of deliveries, we project that our commitment would likely be reduced to approximately 240 Bcf. The maximum volume required in any given year is approximately 109 MMcf/d. Given the size of our Jackson Dome proved CO2 reserves at December 31, 2011 (approximately 6.7 Tcf before deducting approximately 84.7 Bcf for the three VPPs), our current production capabilities and our projected levels of CO2 usage for our own tertiary flooding program, we believe that we will be able to meet these delivery obligations. In conjunction with the August 1, 2011 Riley Ridge acquisition, we assumed the 20 year helium supply contract under which the original participants in Riley Ridge agreed to supply helium to a third party purchaser. Subsequently, we amended this contract to provide for annual delivery (to the 8/8ths working interest) of 127 MMcf of helium (previously 200 MMcf) during the first two years of the contract and thereafter to provide for delivery of 400 MMcf of helium per year. If the contracted quantity of helium is not supplied, we are obligated to compensate the third party helium purchaser for the amount of the shortfall in an amount not to exceed $8.0 million per year. The start up of the Riley Ridge plant is currently expected to occur in the second quarter of 2012. 38 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations CO2 Operations Overview. As discussed in Item 1, Business and Properties Oil and Natural Gas Operations Enhanced Oil Recovery Overview above, our tertiary operations have grown to the point that approximately 32% of our December 31, 2011, proved oil and natural gas reserves are proved tertiary oil reserves, almost 47% of our forecasted 2012 oil and natural gas production is expected to come from tertiary oil operations (on a BOE basis), and approximately 62% of our 2012 planned capital expenditures are related to our tertiary operations. We particularly like this play as (1) it has a lower risk, as we are working with oil fields that have significant historical production and data, (2) it provides a reasonable rate of return at relatively low oil prices (we estimate that our economic break even point on a per barrel basis before corporate related overhead and expenses on these projects at current oil prices is in the $40 per barrel range, depending on the specific field and area), and (3) we have limited competition for this type of activity in our geographic regions. Our Gulf Coast region is well developed, as we have been conducting tertiary recovery in this area for over 12 years. In the Gulf Coast region, we own, or control through long term financing leases, an extensive network of CO2 pipelines and own the only significant natural resource of CO2 in the area known to us, and these large volumes of CO2 drive the play. Since we are just beginning our tertiary operations in the Rocky Mountain region, we have significantly fewer oil fields, and our CO2 sources and CO2 pipelines in this region are in the development stage. See further discussion regarding our tertiary operations in Item 1, Business and Properties Oil and Natural Gas Operations Rocky Mountain Region Future Rocky Mountain Tertiary Properties without Proved Tertiary Reserves or Tertiary Production at December 31, 2011. CO2 Resources. Since we acquired the Jackson Dome CO2 source located near Jackson, Mississippi in 2001, we have continued to develop the area and have increased the proven CO2 reserves from approximately 800 Bcf at the time of the acquisition to approximately 6.7 Tcf as of December 31, 2011. During 2011, we drilled three CO2 wells and started the drilling of an exploration CO2 well on a new structure identified by our seismic program. See Item 1, Business and Properties Oil and Natural Gas Operations Enhanced Oil Recovery Overview. Our CO2 reserves at Jackson Dome were essentially the same at both year end 2011 and 2010, after consideration of 368.4 Bcf of CO2 produced during the year. The estimate of 6.7 Tcf of proved Gulf Coast CO2 reserves is based on a gross working interest of the CO2 reserves, of which our net revenue interest is approximately 5.3 Tcf. Both reserve estimates are included in the evaluation of proven CO2 reserves prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton. In discussing the available CO2 reserves, we disclose the gross amount of proved reserves, as this is the amount that is available for our tertiary recovery programs, industrial users and VPPs, as we are responsible for distributing the entire CO2 production stream for all of the owners of the gross reserves. We currently estimate that it will take approximately 1.9 Tcf of CO2 to develop and produce the proved tertiary oil recovery reserves we have recorded at December 31, 2011, in Phases 1 5. Our average daily CO2 production during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was approximately 1.0 Bcf/d, 852 MMcf/d and 683 MMcf/d, respectively. As of February 23, 2012, we currently estimate that we are capable of producing and transporting approximately 1.1 Bcf/d of CO2, approximately 10 times the rate that we were capable of producing at the time of our initial acquisition in 2001. We continue to drill additional CO2 wells, with four more wells planned for 2012 in order to further increase our proved CO2 reserves and production capacity. Our drilling activity at Jackson Dome will continue beyond 2012, as our current forecasts for the existing nine phases suggest that we will need additional volumes of CO2. Our cost to produce and pay royalties and taxes for the CO2 we utilize in our tertiary floods was approximately $0.26 per Mcf in 2011, as compared to our 2010 average cost of $0.22 per Mcf and 2009 average cost of $0.17 per Mcf. The changes in our cost of CO2 are primarily directly attributable to changes in oil prices, as the royalty we pay is directly tied to oil prices. Our estimated cost per thousand cubic feet of CO2 during 2011 was approximately $0.31 per Mcf, after inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense related to the CO2 production but excluding depreciation of our CO2 pipelines, as compared to approximately $0.30 per Mcf during 2010 and $0.25 per Mcf during 2009. Overview of Tertiary Economics. When we began our Gulf Coast tertiary operations several years ago, our operations were generally economic at oil prices below $20 per Bbl, although the economics varied by field. Our costs have escalated during the last several years due to general cost inflation in the industry and higher oil prices, and we estimate that our current break even point for our Gulf Coast operations, before corporate overhead and interest, is at oil prices in the $40 per barrel range. Our inception to date Finding and Development Costs (including future development and abandonment costs but excluding CO2 pipeline infrastructure capital expenditures and expenditures on fields without proven reserves) for our Gulf Coast tertiary oil fields through December 31, 2011, are approximately $14.60 per Bbl. See the definition of Finding and Development Costs in the Glossary and Selected Abbreviations. Currently, we forecast that Finding and Development Costs will average less than $10 per Bbl over the life of each field, excluding pipeline infrastructure, and less than $15 per Bbl over the life of each field, including pipeline infrastructure, depending on the state of a particular field at the time we begin operations, the amount of potential oil, the proximity to a pipeline or other facilities, and other factors. Our Finding and Development Costs to date do not include unproved potential reserves in fields with current proved reserves, and the calculations are based on estimates relating to reserves and costs for which there are inherent uncertainties. Our operating costs for our Gulf Coast tertiary operations are highly dependent on commodity prices; in general, we estimate they could range from approximately $22 per Bbl to $27 per Bbl over the life of each field, again depending on the field itself. 39 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Although we have yet to commence tertiary operations in our Rocky Mountain region, we expect that our tertiary operating costs, including the cost of CO2 resources, will be higher than those in the Gulf Coast region. Potential sources of CO2 in the Rocky Mountain region will require some degree of processing and may involve joint operations or purchase agreements with third parties, all of which will contribute to higher costs. These potentially higher costs attributable to CO2 do not include the expected benefit to be derived from the sale of methane and helium from Riley Ridge, which if included would make the cost of this CO2 competitive and potentially even less expensive than the CO2 at Jackson Dome, with the ultimate effect on our CO2 costs dependent on various factors such as the sales price for the methane and helium production. However, pipeline construction costs in the Rocky Mountain region are anticipated to be lower than those incurred in the Gulf Coast region due to differing geographic and regulatory factors. While these economic factors have wide ranges, our rate of return from these operations has generally been higher than our rate of return on traditional oil and gas operations; thus, our tertiary operations have become our single most important area of focus. While it is difficult to accurately forecast future production, we believe our tertiary recovery operations provide significant long term production growth potential at reasonable rates of return, with relatively low risk; thus, these operations will be the backbone of our growth for the foreseeable future. Although we believe that our plans and projections are reasonable and achievable, there could be delays or unforeseen problems in the future that could delay or affect the economics of our overall tertiary development program. We believe that such delays or price effects, if any, should only be temporary. Financial Statement Impact of CO2 Operations. Our increasing emphasis on CO2 tertiary recovery projects has significantly impacted, and will continue to impact, our financial results and certain operating statistics. First, there is a significant delay between the initial capital expenditures on these fields and the resulting production increases. We must build facilities, and often a CO2 pipeline to the field, before CO2 flooding can commence, and it usually takes six to twelve months before the field responds to the injection of CO2 (i.e., oil production commences). Further, we may spend significant amounts of capital before we can recognize any proven reserves from fields we flood (see Analysis of CO2 Tertiary Recovery Operating Activities below). Even after a field has proven reserves, there will usually be significant amounts of additional capital required to fully develop the field. Second, tertiary projects may be more expensive to operate than other oil fields because of the cost of injecting and recycling the CO2 (primarily due to the cost of the CO2 and the significant energy requirements to re compress the CO2 back into a near liquid state for re injection purposes). The costs of our CO2 and the electricity required to recycle and inject this CO2 comprise almost half of our typical tertiary operating expenses. Since these costs vary along with commodity and electrical prices, they are highly variable and will increase in a high commodity price environment and decrease in a low price environment. As an example (as discussed above), during the two year period spanning 2010 and 2011 the cost of our CO2 varied from $0.20 per Mcf to $0.28 per Mcf. Most of our CO2 operating costs are allocated to our tertiary oil fields and recorded as lease operating expenses (following the commencement of tertiary oil production) at the time the CO2 is injected, and these costs have historically represented approximately 20% to 25% of the total operating costs for our tertiary operations. Since we expense all of the operating costs to produce and inject our CO2 (following the commencement of tertiary oil production), the operating costs per barrel will be higher at the inception of CO2 injection projects because of minimal related oil production at that time. Analysis of CO2 Tertiary Recovery Operating Activities. We project that our oil production from our CO2 operations will increase substantially over the next several years as we continue to expand our program by adding projects and phases. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 147.6 MMBbls of proved oil reserves related to tertiary operations, representing approximately 32% of our total corporate proved reserves, and we have identified and estimated significant additional oil potential in other fields that we own. In order to recognize proved tertiary oil reserves, we must either demonstrate production resulting from the tertiary process or the field must be analogous to an existing tertiary flood. Our new CO2 flood at Oyster Bayou Field started production in late 2011, and Hastings Field began production in early 2012. The reservoir engineers will evaluate the production response to the CO2 injections and determine at what point we will be able to recognize proved reserves at these fields. Currently we anticipate recognizing proved reserves at these two fields by the end of 2012. Thus, the magnitude of proven reserves that we can book in any given year will depend on our progress with new floods and the timing of the production response from new floods and the performance of our existing floods. Our average annual oil production from our CO2 tertiary recovery activities has increased over time, from an average of 3,970 Bbls/d in 2002 to 30,959 Bbls/d during 2011 (31,144 Bbls/d during the fourth quarter of 2011). Tertiary oil production represented approximately 48% of our continuing production during 2011 on a BOE basis. We expect that this tertiary related oil production will continue to increase, although the increases are not always predictable or consistent. While we may have temporary fluctuations in oil production related to tertiary operations, this usually does not indicate any issue with the proved and potential oil reserves recoverable with CO2. A detailed discussion of each of our tertiary oil fields and the development of each is included in Item 1, Business and Properties. 40 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

Phase 6, Citronelle Field, will require an extension to the Free State CO2 Pipeline or another pipeline, depending on the ultimate CO2 source for this field, the timing of which is uncertain. Phase 7, Hastings Field, is currently being injected with CO2, with first tertiary oil response in early 2012. (2) Included in tertiary operating expenses are certain prior period amounts that have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these reclassifications. Oil production from our tertiary operations increased to an average of 30,959 Bbls/d during 2011, a 7% increase over our 2010 tertiary production level of 29,062 Bbls/d, primarily due to production growth in response to continued expansion of the tertiary floods in Delhi, Tinsley, Cranfield and Heidelberg fields. Offsetting 2011 production gains were declines in our more mature Phase 1 and Phase 2 fields (excluding Heidelberg). Tertiary oil production during the fourth quarter of 2011 was relatively flat compared to both the fourth quarter 2010 levels and third quarter 2011 levels. Oyster Bayou and Hastings Fields experienced their initial tertiary production response in late December 2011 and in late January 2012, respectively. We expect 2012 tertiary production to be positively impacted by increased production at these fields. Oil production from our tertiary operations averaged 29,062 Bbls/d during 2010, a 19% increase over our 2009 tertiary production level of 24,343 Bbls/d. Tertiary oil production during the fourth quarter of 2010 averaged 31,139 Bbls/d, an 18% increase over the fourth quarter 2009 levels, and a 5% sequential increase from third quarter 2010 levels. These year over year increases were the result of production growth in response to continued expansion of the tertiary floods in our Tinsley, Heidelberg, Cranfield and Lockhart Crossing fields, and to initial production response from Delhi Field during 2010. Offsetting these production gains were declines in our Mallalieu and Eucutta Fields. The production growth rate at a tertiary flood can vary from quarter to quarter as a tertiary fields production may increase rapidly when wells respond to the CO2, plateau temporarily, and then resume its growth as additional areas of the field are developed. During a tertiary flood life cycle, facility capacity is increased from time to time, which occasionally requires temporary shutdowns during installation, thereby causing temporary declines in production. We also find it difficult to precisely predict when any given well will respond to the injected CO2, as the CO2 seldom travels through the rock consistently due to heterogeneity in the oil bearing formations. We find all of these fluctuations to be normal, and generally expect oil production at a tertiary field to increase over time until the entire field is developed, albeit sometimes in inconsistent patterns. These types of fluctuations were most 41 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations noticeable in 2011 at Tinsley and Heidelberg fields, two of our fields which have exhibited strong production growth in the recent past. At Tinsley Field, during the third quarter of 2011, we stopped CO2 injections in parts of the field in order to address issues with wells that were improperly plugged by prior operators. At Heidelberg Field, we had to modify 39 wells in order to address conformance issues (i.e., to control the flow of the CO2 to the desired geologic zone within the reservoir) during 2011. This conformance work caused a temporary decline in production at Heidelberg. Production during the fourth quarter of 2011 exceeded third quarter levels, but reduced our previously anticipated production growth during 2011. These temporary fluctuations have not changed our overall expectations of recovery in the Heidelberg and Tinsley fields. During 2011, operating costs for our tertiary properties averaged $24.08 per Bbl, higher than the 2010 average of $21.68 per Bbl, which was in turn higher than the 2009 average of $21.14 per Bbl. Our higher per barrel costs in 2011 were due primarily to higher workover, power, and facility and compressor repair expenses, plus higher CO2 costs due to higher oil prices, to which CO2 costs are partially tied. Our per barrel costs in 2010 were higher than in 2009 due primarily to the higher cost of CO2 during the period. Our single highest cost for our tertiary operations is our cost for fuel and utilities, which averaged $6.31 per Bbl in 2011, $5.93 per Bbl in 2010 and $5.76 per Bbl in 2009, which has increased on a per barrel basis due to the higher cost of these items, and the continued expansion of our tertiary floods. For any specific field, we expect our tertiary lease operating expense per BOE to be high initially and then decrease as production increases, ultimately leveling off until production begins to decline in the later life of the field, when lease operating expense per Bbl will again increase. Operating Results As summarized in the Overview section above, and discussed in further detail below, our operating results in 2011 were in many ways our best ever and have increased significantly over the last three years. As we controlled the general partner of ENP from the date of the Encore Merger until we sold our ownership interests in ENP on December 31, 2010, the operating results of ENP were consolidated with our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, even though we only owned approximately 46% of ENPs common units. The primary factors impacting our operating results were fluctuating commodity prices, changes in the fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts, increases and decreases in production, the Encore Merger and the subsequent sale of non strategic legacy Encore assets and ENP ownership interests, which are all explained in more detail below. 42 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

(2) Represents pro forma production assuming we had reported the production from the Encore Merger between January 1, 2010 and March 8, 2010. (3) Denbury has entered into a purchase and sale agreement to dispose of certain non core Gulf Coast assets. The closing date of the sale is expected to occur in late February 2012. As outlined in the above table, continuing production increased 6,288 BOE/d (11%) between 2010 and 2011, and increased 5% when including Encores 2010 pre merger production. The increases were primarily due to production increases from the Bakken and our tertiary oil fields (see a discussion of our tertiary operations in CO2 Operations above), offset by normal declines in most of our other non tertiary properties. Total production decreased 10% year over year due primarily to the sale of non strategic legacy Encore and ENP properties during 2010. 44 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Production from our Bakken properties averaged 8,788 BOE/d during 2011, compared to 4,480 BOE/d during 2010, when including Encores pre merger production. The production increases in the Bakken are due to an acceleration of our drilling activities in the area, as we increased our operated drilling rigs from two at the time of the Encore acquisition in March 2010, to five at the beginning of 2011, seven at the end of the third quarter of 2011 and six at the end of 2011. During 2011, we drilled and completed 30 operated wells in the Bakken. Our Bakken production growth for the first half of 2011 was negatively impacted by severe winter weather and spring flooding, which caused delays in well completions and curtailments in oil production; however, with the increase in operated drilling rigs and good weather conditions, we have caught up on the backlog of our wells requiring fracturing treatment. We currently intend to begin 2012 with six operated rigs and then gradually decline to three rigs by mid year. We may eventually decide to only reduce our Bakken rig count to four rigs if oil prices and hence operating cash flow exceeds our expectations. Our production from the Cedar Creek Anticline generally declines in periods of increasing prices due to a net profits interest associated with this production; therefore, a portion of the decline in 2011 production at this field is related to the increase in oil prices during 2011. Overall production for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased slightly from third quarter 2011 levels as increases in Bakken production offset normal declines in production from our other non tertiary properties. The increase in production from 2009 to 2010 is due primarily to the additional production from the properties acquired in the Encore Merger, a 19% increase in tertiary oil production and a full year of production from the Conroe Field acquisition, which closed in December 2009. Offsetting these increases were the Barnett Shale dispositions in 2009. Excluding production from the Barnett Shale properties sold during 2009 and production attributable to the non strategic legacy Encore and ENP properties sold during 2010, production would have averaged 59,273 BOE/d during 2010 and 38,760 BOE/d during 2009, a 53% increase year to year. Our production during 2011 was 93% oil as compared to 82% during 2010 and 77% during 2009. The increase in oil production percentage in 2011 is due to the sales of the non strategic Encore and ENP properties during 2010, which had a higher percentage of natural gas production, and increases in our tertiary and Bakken production, which are primarily oil. The increase in oil production percentage in 2010 compared to 2009 is due to the sale of our natural gas rich Barnett Shale properties in the second half of 2009, the acquisition of interests in the oil rich Conroe Field in December 2009, and the increase in our tertiary operations, partially offset by the non strategic natural gas properties that we acquired in the Encore Merger and subsequently sold during 2010. Oil and Natural Gas Revenues Although our production for 2011 declined from 2010 levels due to the asset sales discussed above, our oil and natural gas revenues increased significantly in the current period due to higher oil prices. Higher production and commodity prices resulted in an increase in our oil and natural gas revenue between 2009 and 2010. The changes in revenues due to these factors, excluding any impact of our derivative contracts, are reflected in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 In thousands Increase (decrease) in Revenues Percentage Increase (decrease) in Revenues Increase in Revenues Percentage Increase in Revenues Change in revenues due to: Increase (decrease) in production $ (178,709) (10%) $ 441,959 51% Increase in commodity prices 654,568 37% 484,624 56% Total increase in revenues $ 475,859 27% $ 926,583 107% 45 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Excluding any impact of our derivative contracts, our net realized commodity prices and NYMEX differentials were as follows during 2011, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net Realized Prices: Oil price per Bbl $ 100.03 $ 75.97 $ 57.75 Natural gas price per Mcf 4.79 4.63 3.54 Price per BOE 94.68 67.37 49.16 NYMEX Differentials: Oil per Bbl $ 4.95 $ (3.54 ) $ (4.21 ) Natural gas per Mcf 0.76 0.23 (0.63 ) Our oil price differentials improved $8.49 per Bbl, from $3.54 per Bbl below NYMEX in 2010 to $4.95 per Bbl above NYMEX in 2011, primarily due to the favorable price differential for crude oil sold under LLS index pricing. Prices received in a regional market can differ from NYMEX pricing due to a variety of reasons, including supply and or demand factors and location differentials. NYMEX pricing, which has long been a benchmark price that reflects the economics in the U.S. midcontinent market, has been influenced in the recent past by significant increases in supply. Alternatively, the LLS market is reflective of market economics at the Gulf Coast, where both foreign and domestic oil is bought and sold, and correlates more closely to global oil prices. During the first quarter of 2011, the LLS index price began to increase significantly more than NYMEX prices, causing the LLS differential to increase to $9.28 per Bbl on a trade month basis, and it continued to increase, reaching $15.32 per Bbl in the second quarter of 2011 and $18.90 per Bbl in the third quarter of 2011. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the LLS differential rose to a positive differential of $23.36 per Bbl above NYMEX but ended 2011 at $8.92 per Bbl above NYMEX. It is uncertain how long this LLS differential will remain at this level. Because our derivative contracts are based on NYMEX prices, those contracts do not impact the differential we receive. Overall, during 2011, we sold approximately (a) 45% of our crude oil based on the LLS index price, although due to contract provisions we may not realize the benefit of the full differential; (b) 28% based on NYMEX or West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Posting plus Argus P+ prices; and (c) 27% based on various other indexes, most of which have also improved relative to WTI, but to a lesser degree. Our Company wide oil NYMEX differential improved during 2010 over our differential in 2009 primarily due to the 2009 sale of our Barnett Shale properties, where the natural gas liquids price was significantly below NYMEX oil prices, partially offset by the Rocky Mountain properties we acquired in the Encore Merger, which tend to have oil differentials worse than our historical corporate average. Our natural gas NYMEX differentials are generally caused by movement in the NYMEX natural gas prices during the month, as most of our natural gas is sold on an index price that is set near the first of each month. While the percentage change in NYMEX natural gas differentials can be quite large, these differentials are very seldom more than a dollar above or below NYMEX prices. 46 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Contracts The following table summarizes the impact our oil and natural gas derivative contracts had on our operating results for 2011, 2010 and 2009: Non Cash Fair Value Cash Settlements Gain/(Loss) Receipt/(Payment) In thousands 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Crude oil derivative contracts: First quarter $ (167,064) $ 61,821 $ (95,861) $ (5,028) $ (63,550) $ 85,836 Second quarter 187,194 145,099 (189,318) (16,972) (13,829) 42,002 Third quarter 205,355 (62,450) (20,850) (1,857) (3,590) 18,527 Fourth quarter (166,505) (100,029) (69,721) (1,271) (12,448) 369 Full Year $ 58,980 $ 44,441 $ (375,750) $ (25,128) $ (93,417) $ 146,734 Natural gas derivative contracts: First quarter $ (5,274) $ 39,018 $ (10,490) $ 6,616 $ 3,749 $ Second quarter (3,348) (19,909) (5,473) 6,030 16,630 Third quarter 229 19,933 (1,434) 6,427 13,626 Fourth quarter(1) (467) (30,457) 10,187 8,432 27,800 Full Year $ (8,860) $ 8,585 $ (7,210) $ 27,505 $ 61,805 $ Total commodity derivative contracts: First quarter $ (172,338) $ 100,839 $ (106,351) $ 1,588 $ (59,801) $ 85,836 Second quarter 183,846 125,190 (194,791) (10,942) 2,801 42,002 Third quarter 205,584 (42,517) (22,284) 4,570 10,036 18,527 Fourth quarter (166,972) (130,486) (59,534) 7,161 15,352 369 Full Year $ 50,120 $ 53,026 $ (382,960) $ 2,377 $ (31,612) $ 146,734 (1) Natural gas derivative settlements for the fourth quarter of 2010 include receipts of $10.0 million related to the monetization of natural gas swaps that were unwound due to the sale of our Haynesville and East Texas assets. Changes in commodity prices and the expiration of contracts cause fluctuations in the estimated fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts. Because we do not utilize hedge accounting for our commodity derivative contracts, the period to period changes in the fair value of these contracts, as outlined above, are recognized in our statements of operations. Production Expenses Lease operating expenses increased $37.0 million (8%), from $470.4 million in 2010 to $507.4 million in 2011, primarily due to an 18% increase in our tertiary operating expenses, from $229.9 million to $272.1 million, partially offset by a $5.1 million or 2% decrease in our non tertiary operating expenses. The increase in our tertiary operating expenses is further discussed under CO2 Operations above. The decrease in our non tertiary operating costs is primarily due to the sale of non strategic Encore assets during 2010, which reduced our lease operating costs by $44.1 million, partially offset by higher operating costs in our Rocky Mountain region. Increases in our Rocky Mountain region operating expenses are primarily attributable to (1) the 2010 period being approximately ten months, as the properties were acquired in early March 2010, (2) the Cedar Creek Anticline, where we experienced higher workover costs in 2011 compared to 2010, and (3) the Bakken, where production has increased significantly since 2010 due to new wells. Our lease operating expense on a per BOE basis increased $3.50 (20%), from $17.67 in 2010 to $21.17 in 2011, primarily due to the sale of non strategic Encore and ENP properties from May 2010 through December 2010, which were primarily natural gas properties that generally had a lower operating cost per BOE than Denburys legacy properties, and to higher tertiary operating costs per BOE, which are further discussed under CO2 Operations above. Lease operating expense increased by 49% in absolute dollars between 2009 and 2010 but decreased 1% on a per BOE basis. The increase on an absolute basis was primarily attributable to the properties acquired in the Encore Merger and further expansion of our tertiary operations, partially offset by the 2009 sale of our Barnett Shale properties. The decrease on a per BOE basis was primarily due to the Encore Merger, as the assets acquired generally had a lower lease operating expense per BOE than Denburys legacy properties, of which the majority are CO2 enhanced oil recovery properties. 47 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Taxes other than income, which increased by 36% on a per BOE basis between 2010 and 2011 and 85% on a per BOE basis between 2009 and 2010, includes ad valorem, production and franchise taxes. The increase in each period is largely attributable to an increase in production taxes, which generally fluctuate in line with oil and natural gas revenues. General and Administrative Expenses (G&A) Year Ended December 31, In thousands, except per BOE data and employees 2011 2010 2009 Administrative costs $ 246,112 $ 231,280 $ 143,200 Stock based compensation 39,875 33,926 24,322 Founders retirement compensation 10,000 Incentive compensation for Genesis management 1,149 14,212 Operator labor and overhead recovery charges (125,466 ) (112,160 ) (76,044 ) Capitalized exploration and development costs (34,996 ) (20,074 ) (13,905 ) Net G&A expense $ 125,525 $ 134,121 $ 101,785 G&A per BOE: Administrative costs, net $ 3.98 $ 3.95 $ 3.23 Stock based compensation, net 1.26 1.05 1.16 Founders retirement compensation 0.57 Incentive compensation for Genesis management 0.04 0.81 Net G&A expense $ 5.24 $ 5.04 $ 5.77 Employees as of December 31 1,308 1,195 830 Administrative costs increased $14.8 million, or 6%, between 2010 and 2011, and increased $88.1 million, or 62%, between 2009 and 2010. The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily due to increased expense resulting from the Encore Merger, as the 2010 period includes the effect of the Encore Merger beginning on the acquisition date, March 9, 2010. The number of employees at December 31, 2011 represents a 53% increase over our headcount prior to the Encore Merger, which was 856 employees. Additional expense attributable to the legacy Encore office leases and the new Denbury headquarters lease, together with related moving costs, and additional compensation related to the resignation of our former President and Chief Operating Officer also contributed to the higher administrative costs during 2011. A decrease in expense related to the Companys discretionary annual bonus plan during 2011 was offset by an increase in salary expenses, which is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of employees during 2011. The increase in administrative costs during 2011 was partially offset by a reduction in professional services incurred primarily due to the 2010 period being unusually high because of integration activities related to the Encore Merger. Stock based compensation costs increased during 2011 primarily due to the increased number of employees during 2011 as compared to 2010. Stock based compensation, net of amounts reclassified to field operations or capitalized, were approximately $30.3 million in 2011, $27.9 million in 2010 and $20.5 million in 2009. The increase in administrative and stock based compensation costs during 2011 was partially offset by an increase in operator overhead recovery charges. Our well operating agreements allow us, when we are the operator, to charge a well with a specified overhead rate during the drilling phase and also to charge a monthly fixed overhead rate for each producing well. In addition, salaries associated with field personnel are initially recorded as administrative costs and subsequently reclassified to lease operating expenses or capitalized to field development costs to the extent those individuals are dedicated to oil and gas production and development activities. As a result of additional operated wells and drilling activities, additional tertiary operations and increased compensation expense, the amount we recovered as operator labor and overhead charges increased by 12% between 2010 and 2011. Capitalized exploration and development costs also increased between the periods, primarily due to increased compensation costs subject to capitalization. Administrative costs increased between 2009 and 2010 primarily due to the Encore Merger, including higher compensation and personnel related costs associated with a 44% increase in the number of employees between respective year ends, increased third party professional services fees and higher office operating expenses attributable to the legacy Encore and new Denbury headquarters office leases. Stock based compensation increased 39% during 2010, as compared to 2009, due to an increase in the number of employees and changes in the mix of compensation awarded to employees. Increases to administrative costs and stock based compensation were partially offset by the reduction in 2010 of charges associated with the nonrecurring compensation agreements between the Company and 1) its founder and former CEO and 2) certain members of Genesis management. Recovery of operator and labor charges and capitalization of exploration and development costs also increased during 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to increased drilling activity and higher compensation costs. The net effect was a 6% decrease in net G&A expense between 2010 and 2011, and a 32% increase in net G&A expense between 2009 and 2010. On a per BOE basis, net G&A expense increased 4% in 2011 compared to 2010, and decreased 13% in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to changes in production and the lack of non recurring charges in 2010 as compared to 2009, as discussed above. 48 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Interest and Financing Expenses Year Ended December 31, In thousands, except per BOE data and interest rates 2011 2010 2009 Cash interest expense $ 207,727 $ 221,759 $ 108,629 Non cash interest expense 18,219 21,169 7,397 Less: Capitalized interest (61,586 ) (66,815 ) (68,596 ) Interest expense $ 164,360 $ 176,113 $ 47,430 Interest income and other income $ 17,462 $ 7,758 $ 9,019 Net cash interest expense and other income per BOE (1) $ 5.42 $ 5.67 $ 2.14 Average debt outstanding $ 2,470,682 $ 2,736,634 $ 1,265,142 Average interest rate (2) 8.4 % 8.1 % 8.6 % (1) Cash interest expense less capitalized interest less interest and other income on BOE basis. (2) Includes commitment fees but excludes debt issue costs and amortization of discount or premium. Interest expense decreased $11.8 million, or 7%, between 2011 and 2010, and increased $128.7 million, or 271%, between 2009 and 2010. Interest expense decreased between 2010 and 2011 primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding. Our debt level increased in early 2010 as a result of the Encore Merger and decreased throughout 2010 and in early 2011, as we repaid debt with proceeds from the sale of non strategic legacy Encore assets and our ENP ownership interests. Also, in early 2011 we refinanced $525 million of our 7% senior subordinated debt with $400 million of our 6% senior subordinated debt, decreasing our debt outstanding and interest rate. Capitalized interest decreased 8% between 2010 and 2011 due to a reduction in capitalized interest on the Green Pipeline, which was placed in service during 2010, offset by incremental capitalized interest on CO2 floods, Riley Ridge and the Greencore Pipeline. The increase in interest expense between 2009 and 2010 is due to the increase in our average debt outstanding to finance the Encore Merger, which closed in March 2010. Interest capitalized during 2010 was comparable to the 2009 amount due to the continued construction of the Green Pipeline through most of that year. Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization ("DD&A") Year Ended December 31, In thousands, except per BOE data 2011 2010 2009 Depletion and depreciation of oil and natural gas properties $ 362,788 $ 394,957 $ 203,719 Depletion and depreciation of CO2 properties 18,220 20,665 18,052 Asset retirement obligations 6,287 6,443 3,280 Depreciation of other fixed assets 21,901 21,860 13,272 Cumulative change due to revision in policy for CO2 properties (9,618 ) Total DD&A $ 409,196 $ 434,307 $ 238,323 DD&A per BOE: Oil and natural gas properties $ 15.40 $ 15.08 $ 11.74 CO2 and other fixed assets 1.67 1.60 1.78 Cumulative change due to revision in policy for CO2 properties (0.36 ) Total DD&A cost per BOE $ 17.07 $ 16.32 $ 13.52 We adjust our DD&A rate each quarter for significant changes in our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and costs; thus, our DD&A rate has changed significantly, and it may continue to change in the future. Depletion of oil and natural gas properties decreased on an absolute dollars basis during 2011 as compared to 2010, primarily due to the sale of non strategic legacy Encore assets and our ownership interests in ENP during 2010. Depletion of oil and gas properties increased on a per BOE basis during 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to higher costs per barrel associated with our larger 2011 Bakken capital program and upward revisions in estimated future development costs, also primarily relating to the Bakken assets, offset in part by natural gas reserves added from the Riley Ridge acquisition, which were purchased at a low cost per Mcf. Depletion of oil and natural gas properties increased on both a per BOE basis and an absolute dollars basis from 2009 to 2010, primarily due to the fact that the properties acquired in the Encore Merger were recorded at fair market value as required by the FASC Business Combinations topic, resulting in a higher rate than our historical DD&A rate. In addition, the sale of our Barnett Shale assets in 2009 and the acquisition of Conroe Field in late 2009 also increased our DD&A rate. Our proved reserves totaled 461.9 MMBOE at December 31, 2011, compared to 397.9 MMBOE at December 31, 2010, and 207.5 MMBOE at December 31, 2009. 49 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations During 2011, we added approximately 88.0 MMBOE of proved reserves (before netting out 2011 production). The most significant additions were 48.2 MMBOE from the development of Bakken properties, approximately 39.5 MMBOE of natural gas reserves added through the acquisition of Riley Ridge, and 2.7 MMBOE related to commodity price revisions. Our tertiary oil reserves were approximately the same between 2011 and 2010 after adjusting for the 2011 production. We currently expect to book initial proved tertiary reserves for our new tertiary floods at Oyster Bayou and Hastings Fields by the end of 2012. The increase in our proved reserves from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 was primarily due to the acquisition of Encore, development of Bakken properties and the acquisition of Riley Ridge interests in 2010. Our DD&A expense for our CO2 assets decreased in 2011 compared to 2010, due to CO2 reserve increases at Jackson Dome at the end of 2010. On a per BOE basis, DD&A expense for our CO2 assets and other fixed assets increased in 2011 compared to that in the prior year period due to decreased oil and natural gas production volumes as a result of the sale of non strategic Encore properties and our interests in ENP during 2010. Our DD&A expense for our CO2 and other fixed assets increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to other fixed assets added in the Encore Merger. However, our DD&A rate on a per BOE basis decreased approximately 10% between 2009 and 2010 as a result of increased oil and natural gas production volumes as a result of the Encore Merger and as a result of the proved CO2 reserves added at Jackson Dome and Riley Ridge late in 2010. During the third quarter of 2010, we changed our method of accounting for CO2 properties and recorded a one time, non cash net reduction of $9.6 million ($6.0 million after tax) to DD&A expense for the period, which reflects the cumulative impact of the revised accounting policy on our historical financials. See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this change. Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation. Under these rules, the full cost ceiling value is calculated using a 12 month average price based on the first day price of every month during the period. We did not have a ceiling test write down during 2011, 2010 or 2009. However, if oil prices were to decrease significantly in subsequent periods, we may be required to record write downs under the full cost pool ceiling test in the future. The possibility and amount of any future write down is difficult to predict and will depend upon oil and natural gas prices, the incremental proved reserves that may be added each period, revisions to previous estimates of reserves and future capital expenditures, and additional capital spent. Encore Transaction and Other Costs and Impairment of Assets The FASC Business Combinations topic requires that all transaction costs (advisory, legal, accounting, due diligence, integration, third party fees, etc.) be expensed as incurred. We recognized a total of $4.4 million, $92.3 million, and $8.5 million of transaction and other costs during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, associated with the Encore Merger, including $3.6 million and $43.8 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to severance costs. During 2011, we evaluated a potential CO2 resource with known probable CO2 reserves and upon completing our evaluation, we determined the potential resource did not produce reserves in a quantity or at a cost that would benefit our tertiary oil operations. Accordingly, we impaired the related capitalized costs at December 31, 2011, resulting in a charge of $16.6 million, which is classified as Impairment of Assets in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. At December 31, 2011, the Company also recorded an other than temporary impairment on our investment in Vanguard common units. The $6.3 million impairment charge reduces our investment in the Vanguard common units to their trading value as of December 31, 2011 and is classified as Impairment of Assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The units were subsequently sold during January 2012. See Note 14, Subsequent Events, in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, Amounts in thousands, except per BOE amounts and tax rates 2011 2010 2009 Current income tax expense $ 8,249 $ 33,194 $ 4,611 Deferred income tax expense (benefit) 342,463 160,349 (51,644 ) Total income tax expense (benefit) $ 350,712 $ 193,543 $ (47,033 ) Average income tax expense (benefit) per BOE $ 14.63 $ 7.27 $ (2.67 ) Effective tax rate 38.0 % 40.4 % 38.5 % Total net deferred tax liability $ 1,868,420 $ 1,520,538 $ 469,195 Our income tax provision for each of the last three years has been based on an estimated statutory rate of approximately 38%. Our 2011 effective tax rate was consistent with our estimated statutory rate during the year, as nondeductible expenses were offset by the recognition of additional tax benefits in our 2010 tax returns in excess of the estimated benefits included in our tax provision at December 31, 2010. Our 2010 effective tax rate was higher than our estimated statutory rate due to the recognition of additional net tax expense on the revaluation of our deferred taxes at the date of the Encore Merger and as 50 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations a result of our legal entity restructuring at December 31, 2010. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, current income tax expense represents our anticipated alternative minimum cash taxes that we cannot offset with enhanced oil recovery credits, as well as state income taxes. Offsetting current income tax expense during 2011 was a net benefit due to the change in treatment for certain items between our 2010 tax provision and our 2010 filed tax return. This change in treatment resulted in a reclassification of approximately $16.9 million from current to deferred taxes. The significant increase in our total net deferred tax liability in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to the Encore Merger, in which Encores net deferred tax liability and tax attributes carried over to us. As of December 31, 2011, we had an estimated $53.4 million of enhanced oil recovery credits to carry forward that can be utilized to reduce our current income taxes during 2012 or future years. These enhanced oil recovery credits do not begin to expire until 2023. Since the ability to earn additional enhanced oil recovery credits is based upon the level of oil prices, we would not currently expect to earn additional enhanced oil recovery credits unless oil prices were to decrease significantly from current levels. Proposals contained in the Presidents recently introduced budget, along with legislation introduced in Congress, attempt to remove many tax incentives for the oil and gas industry. Those items that would have the most significant impact on us would include the loss of the domestic manufacturing deduction as well as the repeal of the immediate expensing of intangible drilling costs and tertiary injectant costs. It is uncertain whether or not the current administration or Congress will be successful in changing these tax provisions, but if they were successful, it would likely increase the amount of cash taxes that we pay. Should cash taxes increase significantly, it could impact our forecasted 2012 or later year capital expenditures. Per BOE Data The following table summarizes our cash flow, DD&A and results of operations on a per BOE basis for the comparative periods. Each of the individual components is discussed above.

These debt agreements expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2011, we had $385 million in outstanding borrowings on our bank credit facility. None of our existing debt 51 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has any triggers or covenants regarding our debt ratings with rating agencies, although under the NEJD financing lease, in the event of significant downgrades of our corporate credit rating by the rating agencies, certain credit enhancements can be required from us, and possibly other remedies under the lease. The fair value of our senior subordinated debt is based on quoted market prices. The following table presents the principal cash flows and fair values of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2011.

Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Contracts From time to time, we enter into oil and natural gas derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. These contracts have consisted of price floors, collars and fixed price swaps. The production that we hedge has varied from year to year, depending on our levels of debt and financial strength and expectation of future commodity prices. We currently employ a strategy to hedge a portion of our forecasted production approximately a year and a half in the future from the current quarter, as we believe it is important to protect our future cash flow for a short period of time in order to give us time to adjust to commodity price fluctuations, particularly since many of our expenditures have long lead times. See Note 9, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our commodity derivative contracts. All of the mark to market valuations used for our oil and natural gas derivatives are provided by external sources. We manage and control market and counterparty credit risk through established internal control procedures that are reviewed on an ongoing basis. We attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies, monitoring procedures and diversification. All of our commodity derivative contracts are with parties that are lenders under our bank credit facility. We have included an estimate of nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts, which we have measured for nonperformance risk based upon credit default swaps or credit spreads. For accounting purposes, we do not apply hedge accounting to our oil and natural gas derivative contracts. This means that any changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion to earnings. At December 31, 2011, our derivative contracts were recorded at their fair value, which was a net asset of approximately $6.1 million (excluding $4.1 million of deferred premiums that Denbury is obligated to pay for its derivative contracts, which payments are not subject to changes in commodity prices), a significant change from the $44.0 million net liability recorded at December 31, 2010 (excluding $26.7 million of deferred premiums). This change is primarily related to the expiration of oil derivative contracts during 2011, and to the oil and natural gas futures prices as of December 31, 2011, in relation to the new commodity derivative contracts we entered into during 2011 for future periods. 52 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements. Full Cost Method of Accounting, Depletion and Depreciation and Oil and Natural Gas Properties Businesses involved in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. We apply the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Another acceptable method of accounting for oil and natural gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting. In general, the primary differences between the two methods are related to the capitalization of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment. Under the full cost method, all geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool, whereas under the successful efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred. In the assessment of impairment of oil and natural gas properties, the successful efforts method follows the FASB guidance under the Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets topic of the FASC, under which the net book value of assets is measured for impairment against the undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method, the full cost pool (net book value of oil and natural gas properties) is measured against future cash flows discounted at 10% using the average first day of the month oil and natural gas price for each month during the 12 month period ended as of each quarterly reporting period. The financial results for a given period could be substantially different depending on the method of accounting that an oil and gas entity applies. Further, we do not designate our oil and natural gas derivative contracts as hedge instruments for accounting purposes under the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the FASC (see below), and as a result, these contracts are not considered in the full cost ceiling test. We make significant estimates at the end of each period related to accruals for oil and natural gas revenues, production, capitalized costs and operating expenses. We calculate these estimates with our best available data, which includes, among other things, production reports, price posting, information compiled from daily drilling reports and other internal tracking devices, and analysis of historical results and trends. While management is not aware of any required revisions to its estimates, there will likely be future adjustments resulting from such things as changes in ownership interests, payouts, joint venture audits, re allocations by the purchaser/pipeline, or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and gas industry, many of which will require retroactive application. These types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated or determined and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs. Under full cost accounting, the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom used to perform the full cost ceiling test have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible, including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare reported estimates, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statement disclosures. Over the last four years, Denburys annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately 1.6% of the previous years estimates and have been both positive and negative. 53 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Changes in commodity prices also affect our reserve quantities. Between 2009 and 2010, commodity prices increased, resulting in an additional increase in our proved reserves of 2.9 MMBOE. Between 2010 and 2011, oil prices increased, resulting in an additional increase in our proved reserves of 2.6 MMBOE. These changes in quantities affect our DD&A rate, and the combined effect of changes in quantities and commodity prices impacts our full cost ceiling test calculation. For example, we estimate that a 5% increase in our estimate of proved reserves quantities would have lowered our fourth quarter 2011 DD&A rate from $17.76 per BOE to approximately $17.02 per BOE, and a 5% decrease in our proved reserve quantities would have increased our DD&A rate to approximately $18.59 per BOE. Also, reserve quantities and their ultimate values, determined solely by our banks, are the primary factors in determining the borrowing base under our bank credit facility. Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation. The net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties are limited to the lower of unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling. The cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of (1) the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves before future abandonment costs (discounted at 10%), based on unescalated period end oil and natural gas prices during the first three quarters of 2009; and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, the average first day of the month oil and natural gas price for each month during the 12 month periods ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011; (2) plus the cost of properties not being amortized; (3) plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, if any; (4) less related income tax effects. Our future net revenues from proved reserves are not reduced for development costs related to the cost of drilling for and developing CO2 reserves nor for those related to the cost of constructing CO2 pipelines, as those costs have already been incurred by the Company. Therefore, we include in the ceiling test, as a reduction of future net revenues, that portion of the Companys capitalized CO2 costs related to CO2 reserves and CO2 pipelines that we estimate will be consumed in the process of producing our proved oil and natural gas reserves. The fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts is not included in the ceiling test, as we do not designate these contracts as hedge instruments for accounting purposes. We did not have a full cost pool ceiling test write down in 2011, 2010 or 2009. Commodity prices increased between 2009 and 2010. Crude oil prices continued to increase during 2011, with NYMEX oil prices at year end 2011 at $98.83 per Bbl, but natural gas prices began to decline in the second half of 2011, with NYMEX natural gas prices at $2.99 per Mcf at December 31, 2011. Commodity prices have historically been volatile and are expected to continue to be so in the future. If oil and natural gas prices should decrease, we may be required to record write downs due to the full cost ceiling test. The amount of any future write down is difficult to predict and will depend upon the oil and natural gas prices utilized in the ceiling test, the incremental proved reserves that might be added during each period and additional capital spent. Tertiary Injection Costs Our tertiary operations are conducted in reservoirs that have already produced significant amounts of oil over many years; however, in accordance with the rules for recording proved reserves, we cannot recognize proved reserves associated with enhanced recovery techniques such as CO2 injection until we can demonstrate production resulting from the tertiary process or unless the field is analogous to an existing flood. Our costs associated with the CO2 we produce (or acquire) and inject are principally our costs of production, transportation and acquisition, and to pay royalties. We capitalize, as a development cost, injection costs in fields that are in their development stage, which means we have not yet seen incremental oil production due to the CO2 injections (i.e., a production response). These capitalized development costs will be included in our unevaluated property costs if there are not already proved tertiary reserves in that field. After we see a production response to the CO2 injections (i.e., the production stage), injection costs will be expensed as incurred, and any previously deferred unevaluated development costs will become subject to depletion upon recognition of proved tertiary reserves. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we capitalized $65.3 million, $20.5 million and $8.0 million, respectively, of tertiary injection costs associated with our tertiary projects. Income Taxes We make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. Our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes, tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns. Further, we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets (primarily our enhanced oil recovery credits and state loss carryforwards). If recovery is not likely, we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover, which would result in an increase to our income tax expense. As of December 31, 2011, we believe that all of our deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet will ultimately be recovered. If our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not likely. A 1% increase in our effective tax rate would have increased our calculated income tax expense (benefit) by approximately $9.2 million, $4.8 million and $(1.2) million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. See Note 6, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and see Income Taxes above for further information concerning our income taxes. 54 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Fair Value Estimates The FASC defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. It does not require us to make any new fair value measurements, but rather establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy, as they represent observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the reporting date, while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority, as they represent unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. See Note 10, Fair Value Measurements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures regarding our recurring fair value measurements. Significant uses of fair value measurements include: allocation of the purchase price paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in those acquisitions, assessment of impairment of long lived assets, assessment of impairment of goodwill, and recorded value of derivative instruments. Acquisitions Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The FASC Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (often referred to as the exit price). A fair value measurement is based on the assumptions of market participants and not those of the reporting entity. Therefore, entity specific intentions do not impact the measurement of fair value unless those assumptions are consistent with market participant views. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values involving long term tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and long term asset retirement obligations. The valuation of oil and natural gas properties is even more difficult due to the nature of our core business, enhanced oil recovery operations. In order to appropriately apply the FASC standard, we must estimate what value a third party market participant would place on the acquired property. It is very subjective as to what value another entity would place on the potential barrels recoverable with CO2, which impacts our allocation of the purchase price to goodwill, unevaluated properties and proved properties. Although we find that this standard is difficult to apply in our circumstance, we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third party consultants for assistance. The fair values used to allocate the purchase price of an acquisition are often estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method, which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. Impairment Assessment of Goodwill We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of oil or natural gas, a full cost ceiling write down of oil and natural gas properties, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, significant changes in the expected timing of production, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Denbury applies SEC full cost accounting rules, under which the acquisition cost of oil and gas properties is recognized on a cost center basis (country), of which Denbury has only one cost center (United States). Goodwill is assigned to this single reporting unit. In September 2011, the FASB amended its guidance on goodwill impairment testing to permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test. We adopted this guidance during 2011. 55 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Each period a goodwill impairment test is performed, we have the option to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that our reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount. The following events and circumstances are certain of the qualitative factors we consider in evaluating whether it is more likely than not the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount: Macroeconomic conditions, such as deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, or other developments in equity and credit markets. Industry and market conditions, such as deterioration in the environment in which we operate, including significant declines in oil prices, inability to access oil field equipment and or qualified personnel and regulations impacting the oil and natural gas industry, among others; Cost factors, such as increases in power and labor costs; Overall financial performance, such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or forecasted revenues or earnings; Other relevant Company specific events, such as material changes in management or key personnel, a change in strategy or litigation; Material events, such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of our reporting units net assets, including acquisitions and dispositions; and Consideration of the relationship of our market capitalization to our book value, as well as a sustained decrease in our share price. If we determine that it is more likely than not that our reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount, we will proceed to step 1 of the 2 step quantitative goodwill assessment, in which we perform a calculation to compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying cost. In any given period, we have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to step 1 of the 2 step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing for impairment of our goodwill is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates for goodwill, since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include projections of future oil and natural gas prices, projections of estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, projections of future rates of production, timing and amount of future development and operating costs, projected availability and cost of CO2, projected recovery factors of tertiary reserves and risk adjusted discount rates. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information that we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from those projections. Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Contracts We enter into oil and natural gas derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with future oil and natural gas production. These contracts have historically consisted of options, in the form of price floors or collars, and fixed price swaps. We do not designate these derivative commodity contracts as hedge instruments for accounting purposes under the FASC Derivatives and Hedging topic. This means that any changes in the future fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the balance to earnings. While we may experience more volatility in our net income than if we were to apply hedge accounting treatment as permitted by the FASC Derivatives and Hedging topic, we believe that for us the benefits associated with applying hedge accounting do not outweigh the cost, time and effort to comply with hedge accounting. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized expense (income) of $(50.1) million, $(53.0) million and $383.0 million, respectively, related to non cash changes in the fair market value of our derivative contracts.
