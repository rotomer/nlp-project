ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements (including the Notes thereto) in Item 8 of this report. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General Revenues. The Companys revenues vary based upon demand, which affects the number of days the fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned. When a rig is idle, generally no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result. Revenues can also increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs. In order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates, the Company may mobilize its rigs from one market to another. During periods of mobilization, revenues may be adversely affected. As a response to changes in demand, the Company may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously, which may decrease or increase revenues, respectively. Revenues from dayrate drilling contracts are recognized currently. The Company may receive lump sum payments in connection with specific contracts. Such payments are recognized as revenues over the term of the related drilling contract. Mobilization revenues, less costs incurred to mobilize an offshore rig from one market to another, are recognized over the term of the related drilling contract. Revenues from offshore turnkey drilling contracts are accrued to the extent of costs until the specified turnkey depth and other contract requirements are met. Income is recognized on the completed contract method. Provisions for future losses on turnkey contracts are recognized when it becomes apparent that expenses to be incurred on a specific contract will exceed the revenue from that contract. Operating Income. Operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors, but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses. Operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and may not be significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, the Company may realize few decreases in operating expenses since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, the Company is responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically charged to the operator under drilling contracts. However, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, the Company may reduce the size of a rigs crew and take steps to "cold stack" the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income. The Company recognizes as operating expenses activities such as inspections, painting projects and routine overhauls, which meet certain criteria, that maintain rather than upgrade its rigs. These expenses vary from period to period. Costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements. Increased depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades. 14 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 Comparative data relating to the Companys revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below (eliminations offset (i) dayrate revenues earned when the Companys rigs are utilized in its integrated services and (ii) intercompany expenses charged to rig operations). Certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed. Such reclassifications do not affect earnings.

(25,502) (23,803) (1,699) Total Operating Income........................... $ 224,866 $ 56,946 $167,920 High Specification Floaters. Revenues. Revenues from high specification floaters increased $114.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2001 from the same period in 2000. Of this increase, $61.5 million is attributable to the Ocean Confidence, which began operations in early January 2001 after completion of a conversion to a high specification drilling unit. The rig was undergoing this conversion throughout 2000. Higher average operating dayrates contributed $41.9 million to the revenue improvement from 2000 to 2001. Average operating dayrates increased from $94,100 during 2000 to $109,200 (excluding the Ocean Confidence) during 2001. The Ocean Alliance and the Ocean America experienced the greatest increases in dayrates with an average increase of $32,500 per day and $29,500 per day, respectively. Improved utilization for high specification floaters in 2001 accounted for $11.4 million of the increase in revenues over 2000. Utilization for this class of rig rose to 95% in 2001 from 88% in 2000 (excluding the Ocean Confidence). The greatest improvements were from the Ocean Quest, which was idle for almost five months longer in 2000 than in 2001, and the Ocean Clipper, which had less downtime for repairs during 2001. 15 Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for high specification floaters during the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $22.0 million from the same period in 2000. This increase resulted primarily from costs incurred by the Ocean Confidence ($21.1 million) which began operations in January 2001. Other Semisubmersibles. Revenues. Revenues from other semisubmersibles increased $64.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2001 from the same period in 2000 primarily due to higher average operating dayrates. Average dayrates increased to $66,900 per day in 2001 from $61,300 in 2000 and contributed an additional $52.3 million to 2001 revenues. The greatest dayrate increases were for the Ocean General, Ocean Nomad, Ocean Guardian and the Ocean Bounty. However, lower average operating dayrates in 2001 for the Ocean Princess and the Ocean Whittington were partially offsetting. Improvements in utilization contributed $12.2 million to revenue during the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the same period in 2000. Overall, utilization increased to 70% in 2001 from 61% in 2000. The Ocean Epoch spent most of 2000 in a shipyard for water depth capability and variable deckload upgrades while it worked most of 2001. The Ocean Voyager, Ocean New Era and the Ocean Guardian were all idle approximately a half year longer in 2000 compared to 2001. However, utilization decreased in 2001 for the Ocean Whittington and the Ocean Yorktown. The Ocean Whittington was stacked for almost four months in 2001 for a special survey, repairs and preparation for its December 2001 mobilization to Namibia. The Ocean Yorktown was in a shipyard for over two months in 2001 for inspection and upgrades in connection with new contract requirements. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for other semisubmersibles during the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $11.3 million from the same period in 2000. Rig expenses increased $5.2 million for the Ocean Epoch in 2001 from the same period in 2000 when most of the expenses were associated with the rigs upgrade and were capitalized. The Ocean New Eras expenses increased $3.0 million in 2001 as it operated during six months of 2001 but was stacked all of 2000. An additional $2.8 million in contract drilling expense resulted from the mobilization of the Ocean Whittington from Brazil to Namibia in late 2001. Also, contract drilling expense increased $2.6 million from the 2001 inspections of the Ocean Yorktown, Ocean Whittington, Ocean Yatzy and Ocean Princess and $1.8 million from higher Brazilian custom fees in 2001. Partially offsetting these cost increases, contract drilling expenses were $5.5 million lower in 2001 due to Ocean Lexington and Ocean Saratoga repair projects in 2000 not repeated in 2001. Jack Ups. Revenues. Revenues from jack ups during the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $55.6 million from 2000. All of the Companys jack up rigs experienced higher average operating dayrates with the overall average operating dayrate improving from $26,000 in 2000 to $41,000 in 2001. This 58% improvement in average operating dayrates resulted in an increase of $63.6 million in revenues. Lower utilization in 2001 than in 2000 partially offset the revenue improvements that resulted from the higher average operating dayrates. Revenue declined $8.0 million in 2001 as a result of 83% utilization in 2001 compared to 89% in 2000. This decrease in utilization was primarily due to inspection and repairs of the Ocean Summit, Ocean Sovereign, Ocean Crusader and Ocean Champion during 2001. In addition, the Ocean Nugget was stacked for over one half of 2001 and the Ocean King was in a shipyard for part of the last two months of 2001 for inspections and repairs. All of these rigs worked most of 2000. Utilization improvements which were partially offsetting resulted from the Ocean Heritage and the Ocean Tower. The Ocean Heritage, which worked all of 2001, spent part of 2000 in a shipyard for repairs while the Ocean Tower worked most of 2001 but was cold stacked for part of 2000. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense increased $11.2 million for jack ups during the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the same period in 2000. Operating costs were higher in 2001 for the Ocean Champion, Ocean Summit and Ocean Crusader due to inspection and repairs. In addition, rig 16 expenses were higher for the Ocean Tower which operated during most of 2001, but was cold stacked during part of 2000. Contract drilling expense decreased in 2001 for the Ocean Heritage due to major repairs in 2000. Integrated Services. Operating income for integrated services decreased as a result of the difference in number, type and magnitude of projects during 2001 compared to 2000. During 2001, integrated services contributed operating income of $0.6 million to the Companys consolidated results of operations primarily due to the completion of one international turnkey project, which began in the last quarter of 2000, and three turnkey permanent plug and abandonment projects in the Gulf of Mexico. During 2000, DOTS contributed operating income of $1.0 million to the Companys consolidated results of operations primarily from the completion of four turnkey projects in the Gulf of Mexico, one international turnkey project and integrated services provided in Aberdeen, Scotland. Other. Other operating income of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $4.1 million from the same period in 2000. This decline resulted primarily from settlements of prior years disputed revenue in 2000 and lower expenditures in 2001 for maintenance and repairs of spare equipment. Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $24.4 million over the prior year. Higher depreciation in 2001 resulted primarily from depreciation for the Ocean Confidence, which completed its conversion from an accommodation vessel to a high specification semisubmersible drilling unit and commenced operations in January 2001. Also, 2001 depreciation was higher due to an increase of $35.2 million in ordinary capital expenditures compared to 2000. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense increased $1.7 million in 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, travel and professional expenses. Gain on Sale of Assets Gain on sale of assets of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $14.0 million from $14.3 million for the same period in 2000 primarily due to the January 2000 sale of the Companys jack up drilling rig, Ocean Scotian which had been cold stacked offshore The Netherlands prior to the sale. The rig was sold for $32.0 million in cash which resulted in a gain of $13.9 million ($9.0 million after tax). Interest Income. Interest income of $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $0.8 million from $49.5 million for the same period in 2000. This decrease resulted from the Companys investment in marketable securities with lower interest rates in 2001 compared to 2000 and was partially offset by the investment of higher cash balances generated by the sale of the Companys 1.5% convertible senior debentures due 2031 (the "1.5% Debentures") on April 11, 2001, the sale of the Companys zero coupon convertible debentures due 2020 (the "Zero Coupon Debentures") on June 6, 2000 and the December 2000 lease leaseback of the Ocean Alliance. Cash balances available for investment were partially reduced as a result of the Companys redemption of all of its outstanding 3.75% convertible subordinated notes due 2007 (the "3.75% Notes") on April 6, 2001. See " Liquidity." Interest Expense. Interest expense of $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $15.9 million from $10.3 million for the same period in 2000 primarily as a result of less interest capitalized due to the completion 17 of the Ocean Confidence conversion ($2.6 million interest capitalized in 2001 compared to $13.8 million interest capitalized in 2000), the issuance of the Zero Coupon Debentures on June 6, 2000, the issuance of the 1.5% Debentures on April 11, 2001 and interest expense related to the December 2000 lease leaseback of the Ocean Alliance. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting from the Companys redemption of all of its outstanding 3.75% Notes on April 6, 2001. See " Liquidity." Other Income and Expense (Other, net). Other income of $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $24.4 million from other income of $0.3 million for the same period in 2000. This increase resulted primarily from a $27.1 million gain realized on the sale of marketable securities and a $7.3 million receipt of a settlement payment for resolved litigation which were partially offset by a $10.0 million reserve for pending litigation in connection with a proposed class action suit filed against all of the major offshore drilling companies. See "Legal Proceedings" in Part I of Item 3 of this report. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense of $90.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $52.2 million from $38.6 million in 2000 primarily as a result of the increase in "Income before income taxes and extraordinary loss" of $161.5 million in 2001, which was partially offset by a lower effective income tax rate in 2001. The lower effective income tax rate in 2001 was primarily due to the Companys decision to permanently reinvest part of the earnings of its U.K. subsidiaries. Extraordinary Loss. On April 6, 2001, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding 3.75% Notes at 102.08% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest for a total cash payment of $397.7 million. An extraordinary loss of $7.7 million was incurred as a result of the early extinguishment of debt, consisting of $8.1 million of retirement premiums and the write off of $3.8 million of associated debt issuance costs, net of a tax benefit of $4.2 million. See Note 8 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8 of Part II of this report. 18 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999 Comparative data relating to the Companys revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below (eliminations offset (i) dayrate revenues earned when the Companys rigs are utilized in its integrated services and (ii) intercompany expenses charged to rig operations). Certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed. Such reclassifications do not affect earnings.

Revenues from high specification floaters during the year ended December 31, 2000 decreased $50.6 million from 1999. Approximately $65.3 million of the decline in revenues resulted from lower operating dayrates compared to 1999. The average operating dayrate for high specification floaters during the year ended December 31, 2000 was $94,100 per day compared to $122,700 per day during the year ended December 31, 1999. Revenues from high specification floaters were also lower in 2000 by approximately $6.0 million due to revenues received for the 1999 mobilizations of the Ocean Alliance from the North Sea to West Africa and the Ocean Clipper from the Gulf of Mexico to Brazil. The decline in revenues was partially offset by approximately $20.7 million resulting from improved utilization during 2000. Utilization for the Companys high specification floaters was 88% during 2000 compared to 84% during 1999. The Companys drillship, the Ocean Clipper, operated for most of 2000 under a three year contract offshore Brazil. During most of 1999, this rig was in a shipyard for upgrades and repairs associated with this contract. Also contributing to the improved utilization in 2000 was the operation of the Ocean Valiant, which was in the 19 shipyard during part of 1999 for stability enhancements and other repairs. The Ocean Quest, which was stacked during part of 2000, but worked all of 1999, partially offset these utilization improvements in 2000. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for high specification floaters during the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $0.1 million from 1999. Costs for the Ocean Valiant in 2000 were $6.7 million lower than in 1999 primarily due to expenses of $5.3 million incurred for repairs of the rig while in a shipyard during part of 1999. Costs of $3.7 million for the 1999 mobilizations of the Ocean Alliance from the North Sea to Angola and the Ocean Clipper, from the Gulf of Mexico to Brazil, also contributed to the decrease. The decline in 2000 costs was partially offset by higher contract drilling expenses of $9.0 million (excluding mobilization expense) incurred by the Ocean Clipper which began operating in 2000 under a three year contract offshore Brazil. During most of 1999, the Ocean Clipper was in a shipyard for upgrades and repairs which were capitalized. Also offsetting the decrease in costs were expenses of $1.3 million associated with the 2000 mobilization of the Ocean Alliance from Angola to Brazil. Other Semisubmersibles. Revenues. Revenues from other semisubmersibles during the year ended December 31, 2000 decreased $149.9 million from 1999. Approximately $78.6 million of the decline in revenues resulted from lower operating dayrates compared to 1999. The average operating dayrate for the Companys other semisubmersibles was $61,300 per day during the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to $82,400 per day during the year ended December 31, 1999. In addition, revenues decreased by approximately $71.3 million resulting from lower utilization compared to 1999. Utilization for the Companys other semisubmersibles during the year ended December 31, 2000 was 61% compared to 67% during the year ended December 31, 1999. The Ocean Epoch underwent an upgrade of its water depth capabilities and variable deckload and was idle during most of 2000 but worked for most of 1999. The Ocean Rover, Ocean Endeavor, Ocean Guardian and Ocean Voyager were idle during most of 2000 but worked during most of 1999. The Ocean Baroness, which was cold stacked during the first half of 2000 and then mobilized to Singapore for an upgrade to high specification capabilities, worked for most of the first half of 1999. See " Capital Resources." The decline in utilization was partially offset by the Ocean General and Ocean Winner, which worked all of 2000, but were idle most of 1999. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for other semisubmersibles during the year ended December 31, 2000 decreased $10.1 million from 1999. Operating costs were reduced by $6.8 million due to the Ocean Baroness which was cold stacked during the first half of 2000 and then mobilized to Singapore for an upgrade. This rig worked most of the first half of 1999. See " Capital Resources." Contract drilling expense was further reduced by $5.3 million as a result of stacking the Ocean Epoch in late 1999 and $4.2 million associated with mandatory inspections and repairs of the Ocean New Era in 1999. Costs in 2000 also decreased by $3.6 million from 1999 due to the inspection and repair of the Ocean Winner and its mobilization from the Gulf of Mexico to Brazil in 1999. Cost increases in 2000, which were partially offsetting, included higher operating costs of $7.5 million in 2000 for the Ocean General, which was stacked throughout 1999, and $2.4 million associated with the mandatory inspection and repairs of the Ocean Lexington in 2000. Jack Ups. Revenues. Revenues from jack ups during the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $44.4 million from 1999. Approximately $35.1 million of the increase in revenues resulted from improvements in utilization compared to 1999. Utilization of the Companys jack ups during the year ended December 31, 2000 was 89% compared to 61% during the year ended December 31, 1999. In addition, revenues increased approximately $26.4 million due to higher operating dayrates compared to 1999. The average operating dayrate for the Companys jack ups was $26,000 per day during the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to $22,400 per day during the year ended December 31, 1999. The revenue improvement in 2000 was partially offset by a decrease in revenues of $17.1 million from the Ocean Scotian, which was sold in January 2000 but worked for most of 1999. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for jack ups during the year ended December 31, 2000 was $14.1 million higher than for the same period in 1999. An increase of $18.4 million was due to rigs 20 returning to work in 2000, which were idle for all or part of 1999. In addition, contract drilling expense was $4.0 million higher in 2000 due to major repairs to the Ocean Heritage. Higher contract drilling expense in 2000 was partially offset by a decrease of $8.4 million due to the January 2000 sale of the Ocean Scotian. Integrated Services. Operating income for integrated services increased as a result of the difference in number, type and magnitude of projects during the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to the same period in 1999. During 2000, DOTS contributed operating income of $1.0 million to the Companys consolidated results of operations primarily from the completion of four turnkey projects in the Gulf of Mexico, one international turnkey project and integrated services provided in Aberdeen, Scotland. During 1999, DOTS contributed operating income of $0.3 million to the Companys consolidated results of operations primarily for the completion of six turnkey projects in the Gulf of Mexico, two of which began in 1998. Other. Other operating income of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $3.8 million from the same period in 1999. This increase resulted primarily from higher expenditures during 2000 for crew training programs and various settlements of prior years disputed revenue. Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense of $145.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $2.6 million from $143.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase resulted primarily from higher depreciation for the Ocean Clipper, Ocean General, Ocean Concord and Ocean King, which completed various upgrades in the third and fourth quarters of 1999. In addition, depreciation expense was up due to expenditures associated with the Companys ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs. This increase was partially offset by reduced depreciation in 2000 due to the January 2000 sale of the Ocean Scotian and a decrease in goodwill amortization resulting from adjustments to goodwill related to tax benefits not previously recognized for the excess of tax deductible goodwill over the book amount. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense of $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $0.9 million from $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Higher expenses in 2000 were primarily due to an increase in legal and personnel costs. Expenses in 2000 also included costs associated with the Companys participation in the Subsea Mudlift Drilling Joint Industry Project. Gain on Sale of Assets. Gain on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $14.3 million compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Gain on sale of assets in 2000 included the sale of the Companys jack up drilling rig, Ocean Scotian, for $32.0 million in cash resulting in a gain of $13.9 million ($9.0 million after tax). The rig had been cold stacked offshore The Netherlands prior to the sale. Interest Income. Interest income of $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $14.5 million from $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase resulted primarily from the investment of excess cash generated by the sale of Zero Coupon Debentures on June 6, 2000. Interest Expense. Interest expense of $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $1.1 million from $9.2 million for 1999. Interest costs in 2000 were $8.6 million higher than in 1999 primarily as a result of the issuance of the Zero Coupon Debentures on June 6, 2000. This amount was partially offset by a $7.5 million 21 increase in interest capitalized for the conversion of the Ocean Confidence and the deepwater upgrade of the Ocean Baroness. Interest cost capitalized in 2000 was $13.8 million compared to $6.3 million in 1999. Other Income. Other income of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $9.6 million from other expense of $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. In 1999, a pre tax impairment loss of $10.7 million was recorded as the result of the decline in fair market value, judged to be other than temporary, in the Companys investment in equity securities. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $38.6 million as compared to $84.3 million for 1999. This change resulted primarily from a decrease of $129.5 million in the Companys income before income tax expense. OUTLOOK There has historically been a strong correlation between the price of oil and natural gas and the demand for offshore drilling services. As natural gas prices started to decline during the third quarter of 2001, demand for the Companys jack up fleet in the Gulf of Mexico began to soften. Although the Company has maintained jack up fleet utilization higher than the industry average, operating dayrates earned by the fleet have deteriorated. Utilization of the Companys intermediate semisubmersible fleet in the Gulf of Mexico, which had begun to improve during mid year 2001, declined again during the fourth quarter. Contract renewal dayrates for these rigs have also been lower. The Company does not anticipate a change in these deteriorating market conditions until oil and gas price expectations rebound. Utilization for the Companys high specification floaters remained strong throughout 2001. However, towards the end of the year, some deep water capacity became available in the market, and dayrates declined slightly. In the international markets, demand has not been as adversely affected and dayrates have remained fairly strong. The Company believes that continued strength in both high specification and international markets will depend, in large part, on product price stability and or improvement. Significant relocations of drilling rigs from the weaker Gulf of Mexico to international markets could also lower dayrates in non U.S. markets. The Company believes that, in the longer term, deepwater markets will remain strong and the Company is therefore continuing with its ultra deep moored vessel upgrade program. The Ocean Rover has arrived in a shipyard to begin its modification process and the Ocean Baroness has completed its upgrade and is mobilizing to Southeast Asia to begin work under its current contract. LIQUIDITY Operating Activities. At December 31, 2001, the Companys cash and marketable securities totaled $1.1 billion up from $862.1 million at December 31, 2000. Cash of $199.1 million generated by repurchase agreements is included in this amount (see Investing Activities). Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased by $177.5 million to $374.0 million, compared to $196.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This increase in cash was primarily attributable to improved results of operations in 2001. Net income, after adjustment for non cash items, resulted in an increase in cash of $183.0 million. Cash usage due to changes in net working capital components was $5.5 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2001. Investing Activities. Investing activities used $65.9 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to cash usage of $455.2 million during 2000. The $389.3 million decrease in cash usage was primarily due to 22 $166.3 million less cash used in 2001 for the Companys investments in marketable securities than in 2000. Cash used for capital expenditures in 2001 also decreased $55.3 million as a result of the completion of the conversion of the Ocean Confidence. Cash provided by investing activities in 2001 included $199.1 million from securities sold under repurchase agreements and $0.2 million from the settlement of forward exchange contracts. Proceeds from the sale of assets were lower by $31.6 million primarily due to the sale of the Ocean Scotian in January 2000. Financing Activities. Financing activities used $53.6 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $290.8 million of cash provided in 2000. Sources of financing for the year ended December 31, 2000 consisted primarily of the Companys issuance of the Zero Coupon Debentures in June 2000 and the December 2000 lease leaseback of the Ocean Alliance which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $392.6 million and $54.7 million, respectively. On April 6, 2001, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding 3.75% Notes in accordance with the indenture under which the 3.75% Notes were issued. Prior to April 6, 2001, $12.4 million principal amount of the 3.75% Notes had been converted into 307,071 shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at the stated conversion price of $40.50 per share. The remaining $387.6 million principal amount of the 3.75% Notes was redeemed at 102.08% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest for a total cash payment of $397.7 million, resulting in an after tax charge of $7.7 million, which is reported as an extraordinary loss in the Consolidated Statement of Income. On April 11, 2001, the Company issued $460.0 million principal amount of 1.5% Debentures which are due April 15, 2031. The 1.5% Debentures are convertible into shares of the Companys common stock at an initial conversion rate of 20.3978 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures (equivalent to a conversion price of $49.02 per share), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company has the right to deliver cash in lieu of shares of the Companys common stock. The transaction resulted in net proceeds of approximately $449.1 million. Interest of 1.5% per year on the outstanding principal amount is payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning October 15, 2001. The 1.5% Debentures are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with all of the Companys other unsecured senior indebtedness. The Company will pay contingent interest to holders of the 1.5% Debentures during any six month period commencing after April 15, 2008 if the average market price of a 1.5% Debenture for a measurement period preceding such six month period equals 120% or more of the principal amount of such 1.5% Debenture and the Company pays a regular cash dividend during such six month period. The contingent interest payable per $1,000 principal amount of 1.5% Debentures, in respect of any quarterly period, will equal 50% of regular cash dividends paid by the Company per share on its common stock during that quarterly period multiplied by the conversion rate. This contingent interest component is an embedded derivative and had no fair value at inception or on December 31, 2001. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their 1.5% Debentures on April 15, 2008 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or shares of the Companys common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. In addition, holders may require the Company to purchase for cash all or a portion of their 1.5% Debentures upon a change in control (as defined). The Company may redeem all or a portion of the 1.5% Debentures at any time on or after April 15, 2008 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additional cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2001 included $104.3 million for dividends paid to stockholders and the purchase of treasury stock. Depending on market conditions, the Company may, from time to time, purchase shares of its common stock in the open market. During 2001, the Company purchased 1,403,900 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $37.8 million, or at an average cost of $26.90 per share. 23 Also, cash used in financing activities included $9.7 million from the first of five annual payments of $13.7 million (principal and interest) in accordance with the Companys December 2000 lease leaseback agreement with a European bank. The lease leaseback agreement provided for the Company to lease the Ocean Alliance, one of the Companys high specification semisubmersible drilling rigs, to the bank for a lump sum payment of $55.0 million plus an origination fee of $1.1 million and for the bank to then sub lease the rig back to the Company. This financing arrangement has an effective interest rate of 7.13% and is an unsecured obligation of the Company. Cash used in financing activities was partially offset by premiums of $6.9 million received for the sale of put options covering 1,687,321 shares of the Companys common stock. The options give the holders the right to require the Company to repurchase up to the contracted number of shares of its common stock at the stated exercise price per share at any time prior to their expiration. The Company has the option to settle in cash or shares of its common stock. All of these options were outstanding at December 31, 2001. On January 30, February 13, and February 14, 2002, the Company settled some of its outstanding put options with cash payments of $0.4 million, $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively. These put options covered 1,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock and were to expire on February 5, and February 19, 2002. On February 12, 2002, the Company purchased 500,000 shares of its common stock at $40.00 per share to settle put options expiring on that date. See Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements " Common Equity Put Options" in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Contractual Cash Obligations. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN AFTER 5 TOTAL 1 YEAR 1 3 YEARS 4 5 YEARS YEARS (IN THOUSANDS) Long term debt............................. $931,062 $10,426 $23,124 $12,818 $884,694 Operating leases........................... 2,075 1,098 683 277 17 Total obligations.......................... $933,137 $11,524 $23,807 $13,095 $884,711 Other. The Company has the ability to issue an aggregate of approximately $117.5 million in debt, equity and other securities under a shelf registration statement. In addition, the Company may issue, from time to time, up to eight million shares of common stock, which shares are registered under an acquisition shelf registration statement (upon effectiveness of an amendment thereto reflecting the effect of the two for one stock split declared in July 1997), in connection with one or more acquisitions by the Company of securities or assets of other businesses. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had no off balance sheet debt. The Company believes it has the financial resources needed to meet its business requirements in the foreseeable future, including capital expenditures for rig upgrades and continuing rig enhancements, and working capital requirements. CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash required to meet the Companys capital commitments is determined by evaluating rig upgrades to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating the Companys ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, including water depth and drilling capability upgrades. It is managements opinion that operating cash flows and the Companys cash reserves will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments; however, periodic assessments will be made based on industry conditions. In addition, the Company may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. The Companys ability 24 to effect any such issuance will be dependent on the Companys results of operations, its current financial condition, current market conditions and other factors beyond its control. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company spent $160.4 million, including capitalized interest expense, for rig upgrades. These expenditures were primarily for the deepwater upgrades of the Ocean Baroness ($114.3 million) which was completed in March 2002 and the Ocean Rover ($20.7 million) which is expected to be completed in 2003. Also included in this amount was $12.6 million for accommodation and stability enhancement upgrades of the Ocean Nomad which were completed in April 2001. In addition, the pre fabrication of equipment required for the upgrade of six of the Companys jack up rigs accounted for $7.2 million of 2001 rig upgrade expenditures. The Company expects to spend approximately $275 million for rig upgrade capital expenditures during 2002 which are primarily costs associated with upgrades of the Ocean Rover and six jack up rigs. Approximately $34 million of this amount is expected to be used for the completion of the Ocean Baroness upgrade. The significant upgrade of the Companys semisubmersible rig, the Ocean Baroness, to high specification capabilities has resulted in an enhanced version of the Companys previous Victory class upgrades. The upgrade included the following enhancements: capability for operation in 7,000 foot water depths on a stand alone basis; approximately 5,590 metric tons variable deckload; a 15,000 psi blow out prevention system; 3,600 kips riser tensioning and riser with a multiplex control system. Additional features including a high capacity deck crane, significantly enlarged cellar deck area and a 25 by 91 foot moon pool will provide enhanced subsea completion and development capabilities. The Company took delivery of the rig in January 2002. In March 2002 the rig began mobilizing to a location offshore Southeast Asia to begin its current contract. The approximate cost of the upgrade was $170 million. The Ocean Rover, one of the Companys Victory class semisubmersibles, arrived at a shipyard in Singapore for a major upgrade in mid January 2002. The rig will be upgraded to water depths and specifications similar to the enhanced Ocean Baroness for an estimated cost of approximately $200 million with approximately $140 million to be spent in 2002. The upgrade is expected to take approximately 19 months to complete with delivery estimated to occur in the third quarter of 2003. The Company also expects to spend approximately $93 million ($7.2 million spent in 2001) to significantly upgrade 6 of its 14 jack up rigs over the next 2 years to expand the shallow water fleets capabilities. The Ocean Titan and the Ocean Tower, both 350 feet water depth capable independent leg slot rigs, are scheduled to have cantilever packages installed. The cantilever systems enable a rig to cantilever or extend its drilling package over the aft end of the rig. This is particularly important when attempting to drill over existing platforms. Cantilever rigs have historically enjoyed greater dayrates and utilization as compared to slot rigs. The Ocean Spartan, Ocean Spur, Ocean Sovereign and the Ocean Heritage, all 250 foot water depth capable independent leg cantilever rigs, are scheduled to have leg extensions installed enabling these rigs to work in water depths up to 300 feet. The equipment necessary for these upgrades is being pre fabricated and installation is planned to occur as idle time or scheduled surveys arise to minimize downtime. The Company expects to finance these upgrades through the use of existing cash balances or internally generated funds. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company spent $108.2 million in association with its ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs and to meet other corporate requirements. These expenditures included purchases of drill pipe, anchor chain, riser and other drilling equipment. The Company has budgeted $107.1 million for 2002 capital expenditures associated with its ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs and other corporate requirements. The Company continues to consider transactions, which include, but are not limited to, the purchase of existing rigs, construction of new rigs and the acquisition of other companies engaged in contract drilling or related businesses. Certain of these potential transactions reviewed by the Company would, if completed, result in its entering new lines of business. In general, however, these opportunities have been related in some manner to the Companys existing operations. Although the Company does not, as of the date hereof, have any commitment with respect to a material acquisition, it could enter into such an agreement in the future and such acquisition could result in a material expansion of its existing operations or result in its entering a new 25 line of business. Some of the potential acquisitions considered by the Company could, if completed, result in the expenditure of a material amount of funds or the issuance of a material amount of debt or equity securities. INTEGRATED SERVICES The Companys wholly owned subsidiary, DOTS, from time to time, selectively engages in drilling services pursuant to turnkey or modified turnkey contracts under which DOTS agrees to drill a well to a specified depth for a fixed price. In such cases, DOTS generally is not entitled to payment unless the well is drilled to the specified depth and other contract requirements are met. Profitability of the contract is dependent upon its ability to keep expenses within the estimates used in determining the contract price. Drilling a well under a turnkey contract therefore typically requires a greater cash commitment by the Company and exposes the Company to risks of potential financial losses that generally are substantially greater than those that would ordinarily exist when drilling under a conventional dayrate contract. DOTS also offers a portfolio of drilling services including overall project management, extended well tests, and completion operations. During 2001, DOTS contributed operating income of $0.6 million to the Companys consolidated results of operations primarily from the completion of one international turnkey project, which began in the last quarter of 2000, and three turnkey permanent plug and abandonment projects in the Gulf of Mexico. During 2000, DOTS contributed operating income of $1.0 million to the Companys consolidated results of operations primarily from the completion of four turnkey projects in the Gulf of Mexico, one international turnkey project and integrated services provided in Aberdeen, Scotland. OTHER Currency Risk. Certain of the Companys subsidiaries use the local currency in the country where they conduct operations as their functional currency. Currency environments in which the Company has material business operations include the U.K., Australia and Brazil. The Company generally attempts to minimize its currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to the Companys estimated operating costs payable in local currency and in U.S. dollars for the balance of the contract. Because of this strategy, the Company has minimized its unhedged net asset or liability positions denominated in local currencies and has not experienced significant gains or losses associated with changes in currency exchange rates. The Company has not hedged its exposure to changes in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and the local currencies, except in Australia (see "Forward Exchange Contracts") for operating costs payable in the local currencies in which it operates, although it may seek to do so in the future. At present, only contracts covering the Companys five rigs currently operating in Brazil are payable both in U.S. dollars and the local currency. Currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate section of stockholders equity. When the Company ceases its operations in a currency environment, the accumulated adjustments are recognized currently in results of operations. The effect on results of operations from these translation gains and losses has not been material and they are not expected to have a significant effect in the future. Forward Exchange Contracts. In some instances, a foreign exchange forward contract is used to minimize the forward exchange risk. A forward exchange contract obligates the Company to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specified dates. On July 27, 2001, the Company entered into 12 forward contracts to purchase 3.5 million Australian dollars each month end through July 31, 2002. A pre tax gain of $0.4 million related to the forward contracts (a $0.3 million realized gain and a $0.1 million unrealized gain) was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2001 in "Other income (expense)." ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In October 2001 the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 replaces SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and provides updated guidance concerning the recognition and 26 measurement of an impairment loss for certain types of long lived assets. SFAS No. 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 with earlier application encouraged. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 in January 2002 by the Company has not had nor is it expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operation, financial position or cash flow. In August 2001 the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002 with early adoption encouraged. Adoption of SFAS No. 143 in 2003 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operation, financial position or cash flow. In June 2001 the FASB issued two new pronouncements, SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase method and applies to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and also applies to all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is July 1, 2001 or later. There are also transition provisions that apply to business combinations completed before July 1, 2001, that were accounted for by the purchase method. SFAS No. 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 for all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in an entitys statement of financial position at that date, regardless of when those assets were initially recognized. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002 and has suspended amortization of goodwill which was $3.3 million, $4.5 million and $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. SFAS No. 142 does not change the SFAS No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" requirement to reduce goodwill for the excess of tax benefits not previously recognized. See Note 6 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report. The adoption of SFAS No. 142 has not had, nor is it expected to have, a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operation, financial position or cash flow. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time to time by the Company or its representatives are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may project, indicate or imply future results, events, performance or achievements, and may contain the words "expect," "intend," "plan," "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," "project," and similar expressions. Statements by the Company in this report that contain forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, discussions regarding future market conditions and the effect of such conditions on the Companys future results of operations (see " Outlook"), future uses of and requirements for financial resources, including, but not limited to, expenditures related to the deepwater upgrades of the Ocean Baroness and the Ocean Rover (see " Liquidity" and " Capital Resources") and interest rate and foreign exchange risk (see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk"). Such statements inherently are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, general economic and business conditions, casualty losses, industry fleet capacity, changes in foreign and domestic oil and gas exploration and production activity, competition, changes in foreign, political, social and economic conditions, war risk, regulatory initiatives and compliance with governmental regulations, customer preferences and various other matters, many of which are beyond the Companys control. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report and the Companys other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission include additional factors that could adversely impact the Companys business and financial performance. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. The Company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement to reflect any change in the Companys expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward looking statement is based. 27 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The information included in this Item 7A is considered to constitute "forward looking statements" for purposes of the statutory safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. See "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements" in Item 7 of this report. INTEREST RATE RISK The Companys financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include the Zero Coupon Debentures, the 1.5% Debentures, the Ocean Alliance lease leaseback and investments in debt securities, including U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities, treasury inflation indexed protected bonds ("TIPs") and collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs"). At December 31, 2001, the fair value of the Companys 1.5% Debentures, based on quoted market prices, was approximately $421.3 million, compared to a carrying amount of $460.0 million. At December 31, 2001, the contingent interest component of the Companys 1.5% Debentures was carried at its fair value of zero. At December 31, 2001, the fair value of the Companys Zero Coupon Debentures, based on quoted market prices, was approximately $408.9 million, compared to a carrying amount of $424.7 million. At December 31, 2001, the fair value of the Companys Ocean Alliance lease leaseback agreement, based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 7.59%, was approximately $45.9 million, compared to a carrying amount of $46.4 million. At December 31, 2001, the fair market value of the Companys investment in debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government corporations and agencies, excluding TIPs and CMOs, was approximately $250.1 million, which includes an unrealized holding gain of $2.7 million. The securities bear interest at rates ranging from 3.0% to 6.3%. These securities are U.S. government backed, generally short term and readily marketable. The fair market value of the Companys investment in TIPs, based on quoted market prices, at December 31, 2001 was approximately $55.4 million, which includes an unrealized holding gain of $1.1 million. These securities bear interest at 3.6% and have an inflation adjusted principal. The amount of each semiannual interest payment is based on the securities inflation adjusted principal amount on an interest payment date and, at maturity, the securities will be redeemed at the greater of their inflation adjusted principal or par amount at original issue. The TIPs are short term and readily marketable. The fair market value of the Companys investment in CMOs, based on quoted market prices at December 31, 2001 was approximately $442.8 million, which includes an unrealized holding gain of $0.3 million. The CMOs are also short term and readily marketable with an implied AAA rating backed by U.S. government guaranteed mortgages. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK As of December 31, 2001, the Company had contracted to purchase 3.5 million Australian dollars each month through July 31, 2002. These foreign exchange forward contracts are recorded at their fair value determined by discounting future cash flows at current forward rates. At December 31, 2001, an asset of $0.1 million, reflecting the fair value of the forward contracts, was included with "Prepaid expenses and other" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The associated unrealized gain of $0.1 million was included in "Other income (expense)" in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2001. 28
