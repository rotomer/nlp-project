ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements (including the Notes thereto) in Item 8 of this report. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General Revenues. The Companys revenues vary based upon demand, which affects the number of days the fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned. When a rig is idle, generally no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result. Revenues can also increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs. In order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates, the Company may mobilize its rigs from one market to another. During periods of mobilization, however, revenues may be adversely affected. As a response to changes in demand, the Company may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously, which may decrease or increase revenues, respectively. Revenues from dayrate drilling contracts are recognized currently. The Company may receive lump sum payments in connection with specific contracts. Such payments are recognized as revenues over the term of the related drilling contract. Mobilization revenues, less costs incurred to mobilize an offshore rig from one market to another, are recognized over the primary term of the related drilling contract. Revenues from offshore turnkey drilling contracts are accrued to the extent of costs until the specified turnkey depth and other contract requirements are met. Income is recognized on the completed contract method. Provisions for future losses on turnkey contracts are recognized when it becomes apparent that expenses to be incurred on a specific contract will exceed the revenue from that contract. Revenues from reimbursements received for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services and other services provided at the request of the customer in accordance with a contract or agreement are recorded for the gross amount billed to the customer, as "Revenues related to reimbursable expenses" in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior to 2002 and the guidance provided by the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") 01 14 "Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for "Out of Pocket" Expense Incurred," the Company accounted for reimbursements, in most instances, as a reduction of expenses incurred. All comparative periods presented have been reclassified to comply with this guidance. Operating Income. Operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors, but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses. Operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and may not be significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, the Company may realize few decreases in operating expenses since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, the Company is responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically a cost of the operator under drilling contracts. However, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, the Company may reduce the size of a rigs crew and take steps to "cold stack" the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income. The Company recognizes as operating expenses activities such as inspections, painting projects and routine overhauls, which meet certain criteria, that maintain rather than upgrade its rigs. These expenses vary from period to period. Costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements. Increased depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 of its Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Managements judgments, assumptions and estimates are inherent in the preparation of the Companys financial statements and the application of its significant accounting policies. The Company believes that its most critical accounting estimates are as follows: Property, Plant and Equipment. Drilling and other property and equipment is carried at cost. Maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments, which 14 meet certain criteria, are capitalized. Depreciation is amortized on the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives. Management makes judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization, useful lives and salvage values. Changes in these assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. The Company also evaluates its property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Managements assumptions are an inherent part of an asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. Personal Injury Claims. The Companys retention of liability for personal injury claims, which primarily results from Jones Act liability in the Gulf of Mexico, is $0.5 million per claim with an aggregate annual deductible of $1.5 million. The Company estimates its liability for personal injury claims based on the existing facts and circumstances in conjunction with historical experience regarding past personal injury claims. Eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ significantly from the estimated amounts. 15 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001 Comparative data relating to the Companys revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below (eliminations offset (i) dayrate revenues earned when the Companys rigs are utilized in its integrated services and (ii) intercompany expenses charged to rig operations). Certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed. Such reclassifications do not affect earnings.

Revenues from high specification floaters decreased $35.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2002 from the same period in 2001. Decreases in the average operating dayrate contributed $38.7 million to the revenue decline as dayrates dropped from $117,700 per day during 2001 to $105,500 per day during 2002 (excluding the Ocean Baroness). All of the rigs in this classification, except the Ocean Confidence, experienced a decline in dayrates during 2002. Most significantly, average dayrates went from $122,900 to $81,400 for the Ocean Valiant, $124,100 to $96,800 for the Ocean Victory, and $108,300 to $84,400 for the Ocean America. Utilization fell from 95% in 2001 to 83% in 2002. Lower utilization in 2002 (excluding the Ocean Baroness which was in a shipyard undergoing an upgrade during all of 2001) accounted for $32.0 million of 16 the overall decrease in revenue. The Ocean America was idle for approximately five months during 2002 but worked most of 2001. In 2002 the Ocean Star and the Ocean Victory spent three and one half months and two months, respectively, in a shipyard for inspections and repairs but both worked all of 2001. Revenues generated by the Ocean Baroness, which began operations in mid March 2002 after completing an upgrade to high specification capabilities, partially offset the overall decline in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 by $35.7 million. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for high specification floaters during the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $29.3 million from the same period in 2001. Operating expenses for the Ocean Baroness added $16.7 million to 2002 contract drilling expense and included costs incurred in connection with the recovery of its marine riser, net of insurance recoveries, as well as its normal operating costs. Shipyard inspections and repairs of the Ocean Star, Ocean Victory, and the Ocean Quest in 2002 resulted in an increase in expenses of $4.9 million. Higher Brazilian customs fees in 2002 for the importation of spare parts and supplies for the Ocean Alliance and the Ocean Clipper added $1.3 million to operating costs. Repairs to the Ocean America and boat and fuel costs while the rig was idle, contributed an additional $1.0 million to 2002 contract drilling expenses. The 2001 recognition of a $1.8 million revision to an estimated insurance deductible for the Ocean Clipper, which lowered costs in 2001, also contributed to the higher comparative costs in 2002. Other Semisubmersibles. Revenues. Revenues from other semisubmersibles decreased $60.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2001 to the same period of 2002. Lower utilization accounted for $38.4 million of the decrease, dropping to 61% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 70% for the same period in 2001. The Ocean Voyager and the Ocean Endeavor have both been cold stacked since March 2002 while both of these rigs worked the majority of 2001. The Ocean New Era was idle or cold stacked all of 2002 but worked almost half of 2001. During part of 2002 the Ocean Worker was in a shipyard for inspection and repairs and the Ocean Saratoga was in a shipyard for repairs. Both of these rigs worked most of 2001. Improved utilization for the Ocean Bounty, which operated most of 2002 compared to being stacked for approximately two months in 2001, was partially offsetting. Lower overall average dayrates contributed $22.0 million to the decrease in other semisubmersibles revenue. However, the average operating dayrate for this fleet increased to $67,900 during the year ended December 31, 2002 from $66,900 during the same period of 2001. This occurred because several of the rigs that were contracted at lower dayrates in 2001 were stacked throughout parts of 2002. Consequently, the average operating dayrate rose in 2002 for the working rigs in this class. Significant changes in average operating dayrates included the Ocean Worker and the Ocean Whittington which decreased approximately $77,900 and $30,700 respectively, and the Ocean Guardian and Ocean Princess which increased approximately $28,300 and $20,800, respectively. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for other semisubmersibles was $12.1 million lower in 2002 than in 2001. The Ocean Endeavor and the Ocean Voyager, which have been cold stacked since March 2002, contributed cost savings of $14.5 million while the Ocean New Era and the Ocean Ambassador, which were both stacked with reduced crews for most of 2002, lowered costs by $4.3 million. Contract drilling expenses for the Ocean Whittington were lower by $2.8 million in 2002 when compared to 2001 resulting from its inspection, repairs and preparation for its mobilization to Namibia in December 2001. Partially offsetting was an increase in 2002 of contract drilling expenses for the Ocean Nomad of $3.0 million. In 2001 the rig was in a shipyard for an upgrade which resulted in lower operating costs. In addition, inspection and repairs to the Ocean Worker added $2.1 million to contract drilling expense in 2002. Also, higher Brazilian customs fees in 2002 for the importation of spare parts and supplies for the Ocean Yatzy, Ocean Yorktown and the Ocean Winner resulted in a $1.4 million increase in contract drilling expense. 17 Jack Ups. Revenues. Revenues from jack ups during the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $75.1 million from the same period of 2001. A reduction in the average operating dayrate from $41,000 in 2001 to $27,300 in 2002, contributed $48.6 million to the overall revenue decline. All of the Gulf of Mexico jack up rigs experienced lower average operating dayrates in 2002. Only the Ocean Heritage, a rig which operated offshore Indonesia and Australia, saw a significant improvement in its dayrate, from $34,700 in 2001 to $85,100 in 2002. Revenues decreased $26.5 million as a result of a decline in utilization to 71% in 2002 from 83% in 2001. Utilization was down for the Ocean Champion, which was idle and or cold stacked throughout 2002, and for the Ocean Spartan, Ocean Spur, Ocean Tower and the Ocean Heritage all of which spent time in shipyards during 2002 undergoing upgrades. All five of these jack ups worked most of 2001. Higher utilization in 2002 for the Ocean Sovereign, which worked all of 2002 but spent most of 2001 in a shipyard for repairs, was partially offsetting. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for jack ups decreased $17.7 million in 2002 compared to 2001. Contract drilling expense was $8.2 million lower in 2002 for the Ocean Spartan, Ocean Spur, Ocean Tower and the Ocean Heritage as a result of a reduction in operating costs while these rigs were in shipyards undergoing upgrades. Contract drilling expense was $8.0 million lower for the Ocean Champion which was idle and or cold stacked during all of 2002 but worked most of 2001. Increased contract drilling expense during the first half of 2001 from repairs to the Ocean Nugget, the Ocean Crusader, and the Ocean Summit also contributed to the lower comparative costs in 2002. Higher expenses for the Ocean Heritage in 2002, primarily due to the mobilization of the rig from Indonesia to Australia and higher labor costs in Australia, were partially offsetting. Integrated Services. Operating income for integrated services decreased $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the same period of 2001 resulting from the difference in type and magnitude of projects during those periods. During 2002, an operating loss of $0.6 million resulted primarily from an unprofitable turnkey project in the Gulf of Mexico. During the same period in 2001, operating income of $0.6 million was primarily due to the completion of one international turnkey project and three turnkey permanent plug and abandonment projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Other. Other operating income of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $9.3 million from the same period in 2001. The increase resulted primarily from a $5.9 million reimbursement of prior year foreign income tax to be received by the Company from its customers and relates to a tax settlement made between the Company and the Norwegian tax authorities in December 2002. The corresponding income tax expense is reflected in "Income tax expense" in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. Also contributing to the higher Other operating income in 2002 was a $2.4 million reversal of an accrual made in a prior year for personal injury claims and the elimination of a $1.0 million reserve for inventory obsolescence, from prior years, that was deemed no longer necessary. Reimbursables, net. Revenues related to reimbursable items that the Company purchases and or services it performs at the request of its customers offset by the related expenditures for these items were $2.5 million in 2002 compared to $2.8 million in 2001. Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $7.5 million over the same period of 2001. Higher 2002 depreciation resulted primarily from depreciation for 2002 capital 18 additions and additional depreciation for the Ocean Baroness, which completed its deepwater upgrade and began operations in March 2002. The suspension of goodwill amortization on January 1, 2002 partially offset this increase. Goodwill amortization during the year ended December 31, 2001 was $3.3 million. See Note 1 " Goodwill" and Note 6 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense was $3.5 million higher in 2002 than in the comparable period in 2001 primarily due to higher personnel costs and professional expenses, including legal fees, tax and accounting fees and security consulting. Interest Income. Interest income of $29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $18.9 million from $48.7 million for the same period in 2001 primarily due to a reduction in marketable securities held and lower interest rates earned on cash and marketable securities in 2002 compared to 2001. Interest Expense. Interest expense of $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $14.5 million lower than in the same period of 2001 primarily due to a $11.9 million pre tax charge that resulted from the April 2001 redemption of the Companys 3.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes Due 2007 ("3.75% Notes"). In addition, the Companys weighted average interest rate in 2002 was lower than in 2001 resulting from the redemption in 2001 of the 3.75% Notes and the issuance of the 1.5% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2031 (the "1.5% Debentures") on April 11, 2001. Interest expense was also lower in 2002 than in 2001 due to more interest capitalized to rig upgrades in 2002. Interest capitalized to rig upgrades was $2.9 million in 2002 compared to $2.6 million in 2001. In 2002 interest was capitalized to the Ocean Baroness during the final three months of its upgrade and during the entire year for the Ocean Rover. See " Liquidity." Gain on Sale of Marketable Securities. Gain on sale of marketable securities of $36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $9.4 million from $27.1 million for the same period in 2001. Other Income and Expense (Other, net). Other income of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $4.2 million from other expense of $2.7 million for the same period in 2001. Other income in 2002 included a $1.1 million pre tax gain on foreign exchange forward contracts. See Note 4 " Derivative Financial Instruments Forward Exchange Contracts" to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Other expense in 2001 included a $10.0 million reserve established for a class action lawsuit which was ultimately settled in June 2002 and was partially offset by a $7.3 million receipt for the settlement of an unrelated lawsuit. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense of $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $53.0 million from $86.7 million for the same period in 2001 primarily as a result of a $164.3 million decrease in "Income before income tax expense" in 2002. The annual effective tax rate increased from 33% in 2001 to 35% in 2002. In 2001 the Company made the decision to indefinitely reinvest part of the earnings of its UK subsidiaries and the annual effective rate for the year 2001 reflects this decision. The effect of the indefinite reinvestment of the UK earnings in 2002 was to lower the annual effective tax rate but this decline was more than offset by prior year foreign tax expense recorded in 2002, primarily $5.9 million for a Norwegian income tax settlement. See " Other." 19 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 Comparative data relating to the Companys revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below (eliminations offset (i) dayrate revenues earned when the Companys rigs are utilized in its integrated services and (ii) intercompany expenses charged to rig operations). Certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed. Such reclassifications do not affect earnings.

(25,502) (23,803) (1,699) Total Operating Income........................... $ 225,083 $ 57,175 $167,908 High Specification Floaters. Revenues. Revenues from high specification floaters increased $114.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2001 from the same period in 2000. Of this increase, $61.5 million was attributable to the Ocean Confidence, which began operations in early January 2001 after completion of a conversion to a high specification drilling unit. The rig was undergoing this conversion throughout 2000. Higher average operating dayrates contributed $41.9 million to the revenue improvement from 2000 to 2001. Average operating dayrates increased from $94,100 during 2000 to $109,200 (excluding the Ocean Confidence) during 2001. The Ocean Alliance and the Ocean America experienced the greatest increases in dayrates with an average increase of $32,500 per day and $29,500 per day, respectively. 20 Improved utilization for high specification floaters in 2001 accounted for $11.4 million of the increase in revenues over 2000. Utilization for this class of rig rose to 95% in 2001 from 88% in 2000 (excluding the Ocean Confidence). The greatest improvements were from the Ocean Quest, which was idle for almost five months longer in 2000 than in 2001, and the Ocean Clipper, which had less downtime for repairs during 2001. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for high specification floaters during the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $22.6 million from the same period in 2000. This increase resulted primarily from costs incurred by the Ocean Confidence ($21.1 million) which began operations in January 2001. Other Semisubmersibles. Revenues. Revenues from other semisubmersibles increased $64.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2001 from the same period in 2000 primarily due to higher average operating dayrates. Average dayrates increased to $66,900 per day in 2001 from $61,300 in 2000 and contributed an additional $52.3 million to 2001 revenues. The greatest dayrate increases were for the Ocean General, Ocean Nomad, Ocean Guardian and the Ocean Bounty. However, lower average operating dayrates in 2001 for the Ocean Princess and the Ocean Whittington were partially offsetting. Improvements in utilization contributed $12.2 million to revenue during the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the same period in 2000. Overall, utilization increased to 70% in 2001 from 61% in 2000. The Ocean Epoch spent most of 2000 in a shipyard for water depth capability and variable deckload upgrades while it worked most of 2001. The Ocean Voyager, Ocean New Era and the Ocean Guardian were all idle approximately one half year longer in 2000 compared to 2001. However, utilization decreased in 2001 for the Ocean Whittington and the Ocean Yorktown. The Ocean Whittington was stacked for almost four months in 2001 for a special survey, repairs and preparation for its December 2001 mobilization to Namibia. The Ocean Yorktown was in a shipyard for over two months in 2001 for inspection and upgrades in connection with new contract requirements. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for other semisubmersibles during the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $11.0 million from the same period in 2000. Rig expenses increased $5.2 million for the Ocean Epoch in 2001 from the same period in 2000 when most of the expenses were associated with the rigs upgrade and were capitalized. The Ocean New Eras expenses increased $3.0 million in 2001 as it operated during six months of 2001 but was stacked all of 2000. An additional $2.8 million in contract drilling expense resulted from the mobilization of the Ocean Whittington from Brazil to Namibia in late 2001. Also, contract drilling expense increased $2.6 million from the 2001 inspections of the Ocean Yorktown, Ocean Whittington, Ocean Yatzy and Ocean Princess and $1.8 million from higher Brazilian customs fees in 2001. Partially offsetting these cost increases, contract drilling expenses were $5.5 million lower in 2001 due to Ocean Lexington and Ocean Saratoga repair projects in 2000 not repeated in 2001. Jack Ups. Revenues. Revenues from jack ups during the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $55.6 million from 2000. All of the Companys jack up rigs experienced higher average operating dayrates with the overall average operating dayrate improving from $26,000 in 2000 to $41,000 in 2001. This 58% improvement in average operating dayrates resulted in an increase of $63.6 million in revenues. Lower utilization in 2001 than in 2000 partially offset the revenue improvements that resulted from the higher average operating dayrates. Revenue declined $8.0 million in 2001 as a result of 83% utilization in 2001 compared to 89% in 2000. This decrease in utilization was primarily due to inspection and repairs of the Ocean Summit, Ocean Sovereign, Ocean Crusader and Ocean Champion during 2001. In addition, the Ocean Nugget was stacked for over one half of 2001 and the Ocean King was in a shipyard for part of the last two months of 2001 for inspections and repairs. All of these rigs worked most of 2000. Utilization improvements which were partially offsetting resulted from the Ocean Heritage and the Ocean Tower. The Ocean Heritage, which worked all of 2001, spent part of 2000 in a shipyard for repairs while the Ocean Tower worked most of 2001 but was cold stacked for part of 2000. 21 Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense increased $11.1 million for jack ups during the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the same period in 2000. Operating costs were higher in 2001 for the Ocean Champion, Ocean Summit and Ocean Crusader due to inspection and repairs. In addition, rig expenses were higher for the Ocean Tower which operated during most of 2001, but was cold stacked during part of 2000. Contract drilling expense decreased in 2001 for the Ocean Heritage due to major repairs in 2000. Integrated Services. Operating income for integrated services decreased as a result of the difference in number, type and magnitude of projects during 2001 compared to 2000. During 2001, integrated services contributed operating income of $0.6 million to the Companys consolidated results of operations primarily due to the completion of one international turnkey project, which began in the last quarter of 2000, and three turnkey permanent plug and abandonment projects in the Gulf of Mexico. During 2000, DOTS contributed operating income of $1.0 million to the Companys consolidated results of operations primarily from the completion of four turnkey projects in the Gulf of Mexico, one international turnkey project and integrated services provided in Aberdeen, Scotland. Other. Other operating expense of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $4.1 million from the same period in 2000. Other operating expense in 2001, primarily for rig crew training and maintenance and repair of spare equipment, was lower by approximately $0.9 million compared to similar expenditures in 2000. Other operating expense in 2000 also included $1.8 million for settlements with the Companys customers related to prior years disputes including compliance audit findings. Reimbursables, net. Revenues related to reimbursable items that the Company purchases and or services it performs at the request of its customers offset by the related expenditures for these items were $2.8 million in 2001 compared to $2.7 million in 2000. Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $24.4 million over the prior year. Higher depreciation in 2001 resulted primarily from depreciation for the Ocean Confidence, which completed its conversion from an accommodation vessel to a high specification semisubmersible drilling unit and commenced operations in January 2001. Also, 2001 depreciation was higher due to an increase of $35.2 million in ordinary capital expenditures compared to 2000. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense increased $1.7 million in 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, travel and professional expenses. Gain on Sale of Marketable Securities. Gain on sale of marketable securities of $27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $25.0 million from $2.1 million for the same period in 2000. Gain on Sale of Assets Gain on sale of assets of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $14.0 million from $14.3 million for the same period in 2000 primarily due to the January 2000 sale of the Companys jack up drilling rig, Ocean Scotian which had been cold stacked offshore The Netherlands prior to the sale. The rig was sold for $32.0 million in cash which resulted in a gain of $13.9 million ($9.0 million after tax). 22 Interest Income. Interest income of $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $0.8 million from $49.5 million for the same period in 2000. This decrease resulted from the Companys investment in marketable securities with lower interest rates in 2001 compared to 2000 and was partially offset by the investment of higher cash balances generated by the sale of the Companys 1.5% convertible senior debentures due 2031 (the "1.5% Debentures") on April 11, 2001, the sale of the Companys zero coupon convertible debentures due 2020 (the "Zero Coupon Debentures") on June 6, 2000 and the December 2000 lease leaseback of the Ocean Alliance. Cash balances available for investment were partially reduced as a result of the Companys redemption of all of its outstanding 3.75% Notes on April 6, 2001. See " Liquidity." Interest Expense. Interest expense of $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $27.8 million from $10.3 million for the same period in 2000 primarily due to the $11.9 million pre tax loss from the April 2001 redemption of the Companys 3.75% Notes and less interest capitalized due to the completion of the Ocean Confidence conversion ($2.6 million interest capitalized in 2001 compared to $13.8 million interest capitalized in 2000). In addition, interest expense increased with the issuance of the Zero Coupon Debentures on June 6, 2000, the issuance of the 1.5% Debentures on April 11, 2001 and interest expense related to the December 2000 lease leaseback of the Ocean Alliance. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting from the Companys redemption of all of its outstanding 3.75% Notes on April 6, 2001. See " Liquidity." Other Income and Expense (Other, net). Other expense of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $0.7 million from other expense of $2.0 million for the same period in 2000. This increase resulted primarily from a $10.0 million reserve for the then pending litigation in connection with a proposed class action suit filed against major offshore drilling companies partially offset by a $7.3 million receipt of a settlement payment for resolved litigation. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense of $86.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $48.1 million from $38.6 million in 2000 primarily as a result of the increase in "Income before income taxes" of $149.6 million in 2001, which was partially offset by a lower effective income tax rate in 2001. The lower effective income tax rate in 2001 was primarily due to the Companys decision to permanently reinvest part of the earnings of its U.K. subsidiaries. INDUSTRY CONDITIONS The Company operates in an industry that is historically extremely competitive and deeply cyclical. The demand for its services has traditionally been highly correlated with the price of oil and natural gas. However, the rise in product prices that began in late 2001 and continued throughout 2002 did not yield the expected improvements in utilization and dayrates for the Companys equipment. The Company believes that its customers have been reluctant to increase offshore drilling expenditures or to commit to long term contracts due to uncertainties about the sustainability of current product prices as well as general uncertainties surrounding the state of the economy and the effects of a possible military conflict in Iraq. In the Gulf of Mexico, well to well contracts are the norm for the Companys deep water semisubmersible fleet, its mid water semisubmersible fleet and its jack up fleet. With limited to no backlog of work for these fleets, the Company does not anticipate any significant improvement in utilization or rates until its customers regain confidence in the sustainability of product prices. 23 Absent a change in its customers perception of the overall energy market, the Company anticipates that the international markets in which it operates will remain relatively flat and consequently expects utilization and rates for its equipment in these markets to remain relatively unchanged. LIQUIDITY At December 31, 2002, the Companys cash and marketable securities totaled $812.5 million, down from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2001. Cash of $199.1 million generated by repurchase agreements is included at December 31, 2001. See Note 1 " Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase" in Item 8 of Part II of this report. A discussion of the sources and uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the same period in 2001 follows. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS) NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net income........................................ $ 62,520 $173,823 $(111,303) Depreciation and amortization..................... 177,495 170,017 7,478 Deferred tax provision............................ 16,598 74,264 (57,666) Other non cash items, net.........................

Operating items provided $49.4 million during 2002 compared to a $42.1 million use of cash in 2001. The $91.5 million fluctuation in operating items resulted primarily from a reduction in accounts receivable related to the lower overall activity of the Companys fleet in 2002. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS) NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES Capital expenditures (excluding rig acquisition)............................. $ (273,805) $ (268,617) $ (5,188) Rig acquisition.............................

This increase in cash usage was primarily due to $199.1 million used for the repurchase of securities in 2002 sold under repurchase agreements in 2001 and the purchase of the Ocean Vanguard in December 2002 for $68.5 million ($67.0 million capitalized to rig equipment and $1.5 million added to inventory). Cash used for capital expenditures in 2002 increased 24 $5.2 million primarily due to the completion of the Ocean Baroness upgrade and the ongoing upgrade of the Ocean Rover. Cash provided by net investing activities increased $160.8 million in 2002 compared to 2001 from the net sale of certain of the Companys investments in marketable securities. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS) NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES Payment of dividends............................ $ (65,685) $ (66,502) $ 817 Acquisition of treasury stock...................

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company purchased 1,716,700 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $43.4 million, or at an average cost of $25.30 per share. This includes the Companys purchase of 500,000 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $20.0 million, or $40.00 per share, upon the exercise of put options sold in February 2001. See " Treasury Stock and Common Equity Put Options" in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Depending on market conditions, the Company may, from time to time, purchase shares of its common stock or issue put options in the open market or otherwise. Cash used in financing activities in 2002 and 2001 included payments of $10.4 million and $9.7 million, respectively, for two of five annual installments of $13.7 million (principal and interest) in accordance with the Companys December 2000 lease leaseback agreement with a European bank. The lease leaseback agreement provided for the Company to lease the Ocean Alliance, one of the Companys high specification semisubmersible drilling rigs, to the bank for a lump sum payment of $55.0 million plus an origination fee of $1.1 million and for the bank to then sub lease the rig back to the Company. This financing arrangement has an effective interest rate of 7.13% and is an unsecured obligation of the Company. Cash used in financing activities in 2002 also included payments of $1.2 million for the settlement of put options which covered 1,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock. Financing activities in 2001 provided cash from premiums of $6.9 million received from the sale of put options covering 1,687,321 shares of the Companys common stock. The options gave the holders the right to require the Company to repurchase up to the contracted number of shares of its common stock at the stated exercise price per share at any time prior to their expiration. The Company had the option to settle in cash or shares of its common stock. Put options sold in 2001, which covered 187,321 shares of the Companys common stock, expired during 2002. There were no put options outstanding at December 31, 2002. See " Treasury Stock and Common Equity Put Options" in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Cash used in financing activities in 2001 resulted primarily from the Companys redemption of all of its outstanding 3.75% Notes in accordance with the indenture under which they were issued. The Company redeemed the outstanding 3.75% Notes at 102.8% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest of $2.1 million for a total cash payment of $397.7 million, resulting in an $11.9 million loss which is reported in "Interest expense" in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Additional cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2001 included $104.3 million for dividends paid to stockholders and the purchase of treasury stock. During 2001, the 25 Company purchased 1,403,900 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $37.8 million, or at an average cost of $26.90 per share. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 consisted primarily of net proceeds of $449.1 million from the issuance of $460.0 million principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures on April 11, 2001. Contractual Cash Obligations. PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN AFTER 5 TOTAL 1 YEAR 1 3 YEARS 4 5 YEARS YEARS (IN THOUSANDS) Contractual Obligations Long term debt............................. $935,630 $11,155 $24,787 $ $899,688 Operating leases........................... 1,802 1,087 578 137 Total obligations.......................... $937,432 $12,242 $25,365 $137 $899,688 Other. The Company has the ability to issue an aggregate of approximately $117.5 million in debt, equity and other securities under a shelf registration statement. In addition, the Company may issue, from time to time, up to eight million shares of common stock, shares which are registered under an acquisition shelf registration statement (upon effectiveness of an amendment thereto reflecting the effect of the two for one stock split declared in July 1997), in connection with one or more acquisitions by the Company of securities or assets of other businesses. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had no off balance sheet debt. The Company anticipates that its insurance premiums will be approximately $7.0 million higher in 2002 than in 2001. In December 2002 the Company renewed its Hull and Machinery insurance policy. The Companys retention of liability for property damage increased at the time of renewal from approximately $0.2 million per incident to between $1.0 million and $2.5 million per incident, depending on the value of the equipment, with an aggregate annual deductible of $5.0 million. In addition, the Company retained 10% of its insured liability. The Company expects to be able to fund the higher premiums and retention through its operating cash. The Company believes it has the financial resources needed to meet its business requirements in the foreseeable future, including capital expenditures for rig upgrades and continuing rig enhancements, and working capital requirements. CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash required to meet the Companys capital commitments is determined by evaluating rig upgrades to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating the Companys ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, including water depth and drilling capability upgrades. It is managements opinion that operating cash flows and the Companys cash reserves will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments; however, periodic assessments will be made based on industry conditions. In addition, the Company may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. The Companys ability to affect any such issuance will be dependent on the Companys results of operations, its current financial condition, current market conditions and other factors beyond its control. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company spent $187.7 million, including capitalized interest expense, for rig upgrades. These expenditures were primarily for the deepwater upgrade of the Ocean Rover ($98.4 million) which is expected to be completed in July 2003, upgrades to six of the Companys jack ups ($50.7 million) of which three were completed during 2002 and three are expected to be completed during 26 2003, and the deepwater upgrade of the Ocean Baroness ($31.4 million) which was completed in March 2002. The Company expects to spend approximately $123 million for rig upgrade capital expenditures during 2003 for the completion of the Ocean Rover upgrade ($80 million) and the three remaining jack up upgrades ($43 million). The upgrade of the Ocean Rover began in January 2002. The converted rig will be able to operate in 7,000 foot water depths on a stand alone basis. Water depths in excess of 7,000 feet should be achievable utilizing augmented mooring systems on a case by case basis. The upgrade is expected to take 19 months to complete with delivery estimated in the third quarter of 2003. The significant upgrade of the Companys semisubmersible rig, the Ocean Baroness, to high specification capabilities resulted in an enhanced version of the Companys previous Victory class upgrades. The upgrade was similar to the upgrade being performed on the Ocean Rover. The Company took delivery of the Ocean Baroness in January 2002. The approximate cost of the upgrade was $169.0 million. In 2002 the Company began a two year program to expand the capabilities of its jack up fleet by significantly upgrading six of its 14 jack up rigs. The Company expects to spend approximately $100 million on the program, and as of December 31, 2002, has spent $57 million. The Ocean Titan and Ocean Tower, both 350 foot water depth capability independent leg slot rigs, were to have cantilever packages installed. The cantilever systems enable a rig to cantilever or extend its drilling package over the aft end of the rig. Currently, the Ocean Tower is in the latter stages of its upgrade with delivery expected in April 2003. The upgrade planned for the Ocean Titan is expected to commence in early 2003. The Ocean Spartan, Ocean Spur, and Ocean Heritage, each had leg extensions installed (all completed during the fourth quarter of 2002) enabling these rigs to work in water depths up to 300 feet, up from 250 feet prior to the upgrades, at a combined approximate cost of $35.7 million. The Ocean Sovereign, a 250 foot water depth independent leg cantilever rig, is currently in a shipyard undergoing leg extension installations to allow the rig to work in water depths up to 300 feet. All of the Companys upgrade projects are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns that are inherent in any large construction project. The Company has signed a memorandum of agreement to purchase the semisubmersible drilling rig Omega for $65 million. The agreement is subject to certain conditions and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2003. Subsequent to its purchase, the Company anticipates that the rig initially will be working offshore South Africa. The purchase of the Omega is expected to be funded from existing cash balances. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company spent $86.1 million in association with its ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs and to meet other corporate requirements. In addition, the Company spent $68.5 million ($67.0 million capitalized to rig equipment) for the purchase of the third generation semisubmersible drilling rig, West Vanguard, renamed Ocean Vanguard. The Company has budgeted $111.3 million for 2003 capital expenditures associated with its ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs and other corporate requirements. INTEGRATED SERVICES The Companys wholly owned subsidiary, DOTS, from time to time, selectively engages in drilling services pursuant to turnkey or modified turnkey contracts under which DOTS agrees to drill a well to a specified depth for a fixed price. In such cases, DOTS generally is not entitled to payment unless the well is drilled to the specified depth and other contract requirements are met. Profitability of the contract is dependent upon its ability to keep expenses within the estimates used in determining the contract price. Drilling a well under a turnkey contract therefore typically requires a greater cash commitment by the Company and exposes the Company to risks of potential financial losses that generally are substantially greater than those that would ordinarily exist when drilling under a conventional dayrate contract. DOTS also offers a portfolio of drilling services including overall project management, extended well tests, and completion operations. During 2002, DOTS had an operating loss of $0.6 million primarily from an unprofitable Gulf of Mexico turnkey project. During 2001, DOTS contributed operating income of $0.6 million to the Companys 27 consolidated results of operations primarily from the completion of one international turnkey project, which began in the last quarter of 2000, and three turnkey permanent plug and abandonment projects in the Gulf of Mexico. OTHER Currency Risk. Certain of the Companys subsidiaries use the local currency in the country where they conduct operations as their functional currency. Currency environments in which the Company has material business operations include Brazil, the U.K., Australia and Vietnam. The Company generally attempts to minimize its currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to the Companys estimated operating costs payable in local currency with the balance of the contract payable in U.S. dollars. Because of this strategy, historically the Company has minimized its unhedged net asset or liability positions denominated in local currencies and has not experienced significant gains or losses associated with changes in currency exchange rates. At present, however, only contracts covering the Companys five rigs currently operating in Brazil are payable both in U.S. dollars and the local currency. The Company has not hedged its exposure to changes in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and the local currencies, except in Australia for operating costs payable in the local currencies in which it operates, but it may seek to do so in the future. Currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate section of stockholders equity. When the Company ceases its operations in a currency environment, the accumulated adjustments are recognized currently in results of operations. The effect on results of operations from these translation gains and losses has not been material and are not expected to have a significant effect in the future. Forward Exchange Contracts. In some instances, a foreign exchange forward contract is used to minimize the forward exchange risk. A forward exchange contract obligates the Company to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specified dates. In June 2002 the Company entered into forward contracts to purchase 50.0 million Australian dollars, 4.2 million Australian dollars to be purchased monthly from August 29, 2002 through June 26, 2003 and 3.8 million to be purchased on July 31, 2003. In July 2001 the Company entered into twelve forward contracts to purchase 3.5 million Australian dollars at each month end through July 31, 2002. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2002 the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure." SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. SFAS No. 148 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The Company accounts for stock based employee compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." However, the Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 148 which require prominent disclosure regarding the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation in its annual financial statements and will include such disclosure in all of its future interim financial statements. In July 2002 the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS No. 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 146 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 28 In April 2002 the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment to FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." The rescission of SFAS No. 4 and 64 by SFAS No. 145 streamlines the reporting of debt extinguishments and requires that only gains and losses from extinguishments meeting the criteria in APB Opinion 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions" would be classified as extraordinary. Thus, gains or losses arising from extinguishments that are part of a companys recurring operations would not be reported as an extraordinary item. SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002 with earlier adoption encouraged. The Company adopted SFAS No. 145 in April 2002 and, accordingly, reclassified its April 2001 loss of $7.7 million, net of tax, from early extinguishment of debt, as a result of the Companys redemption of the outstanding 3.75% Notes, out of extraordinary items. The pre tax loss from early extinguishment of debt of $11.9 million was reclassified to "Interest expense" and the related tax benefit was reclassified to "Income tax expense" in the Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 1 " Capitalized Interest" to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report. In October 2001 the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 replaces SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and provides updated guidance concerning the recognition and measurement of an impairment loss for certain types of long lived assets. SFAS No. 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 in January 2002 by the Company has not had, nor is it expected to have, a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In August 2001 the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002 with early adoption encouraged. Adoption of SFAS No. 143 in 2003 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In June 2001 the FASB issued two new pronouncements, SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase method and applies to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and also applies to all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is July 1, 2001 or later. There are also transition provisions that apply to business combinations completed before July 1, 2001, that were accounted for by the purchase method. SFAS No. 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 for all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in an entitys statement of financial position at that date, regardless of when those assets were initially recognized. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002 and has suspended amortization of goodwill which was $3.3 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. SFAS No. 142 does not change the SFAS No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" requirement to reduce goodwill for the excess of tax benefits not previously recognized. See Note 6 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report. The adoption of SFAS No. 142 has not had, nor is it expected to have, a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time to time by the Company or its representatives are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may project, indicate or imply future results, events, performance or achievements, and may contain or be identified by the words "expect," "intend," "plan," "predict," "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "should," "could," "may," "might," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," "project," "forecast," "budget" and similar expressions.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The information included in this Item 7A is considered to constitute "forward looking statements" for purposes of the statutory safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. See "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements" in Item 7 of this report. The Companys measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of its financial instruments. Market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by the Company at December 31, 2002 and 2001 assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. The Company believes that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since the Companys investment portfolio is subject to change based on its portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur. Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management. Senior management approves the overall investment strategy employed by the Company and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to it. The Company may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions. INTEREST RATE RISK The Company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. The Companys investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities. The Company monitors its sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of its financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates. The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of the Companys investments and the resulting effect on shareholders equity. The analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of the Companys financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which the Company believes are reasonably possible over a one year period. The sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of the Companys interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on December 31, 2002 and 2001 due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes of market interest rates on the Companys earnings or shareholders equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions the Company could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. The Companys long term debt, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 is denominated in U.S. Dollars. The Companys debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates, and as such, interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of $153.8 and $154.3 million, respectively. A 100 basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of $192.7 and $195.3 million, respectively. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had contracted to purchase 50.0 million Australian dollars, 4.2 million Australian dollars to be purchased monthly from 32 August 29, 2002 through June 26, 2003 and 3.8 million to be purchased on July 31, 2003. These foreign exchange forward contracts are recorded at their fair value determined by discounting future cash flows at current forward rates. At December 31, 2002, an asset of $0.2 million reflecting the fair value of the forward contracts, was included with "Prepaid expenses and other" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2001 the Company had contracted to purchase 3.5 million Australian dollars each month through July 31, 2002. At December 31, 2001, an asset of $0.1 million reflecting the fair value of the forward contracts, was included with "Prepaid expenses and other" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 20% change in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar from their levels at December 31, 2002 and 2001, with all other variables held constant. The following table presents the Companys market risk by category (interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates): FAIR VALUE ASSET (LIABILITY) MARKET RISK AT DECEMBER 31, CATEGORY OF RISK EXPOSURE: 2002 2001 2002 2001 (IN THOUSANDS) Interest rate Marketable securities..................... $ 627,614 (a) $ 748,387 (a) $21,500(c) $61,800(c) Long term debt............................

(b) The fair values of the Companys 1.5% Debentures and Zero Coupon Debentures are based on the quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2002 and 2001. The fair value of the Companys Ocean Alliance lease leaseback agreement is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 6.62% for 2002 and 7.59% for 2001. (c) The calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points at December 31, 2002 and 2001. (d) The calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of a decrease in foreign exchange rates of 20% at December 31, 2002 and 2001. 33
