ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements (including the Notes thereto) in Item 8 of this report. OVERVIEW INDUSTRY CONDITIONS The offshore drilling industry continues to be extremely competitive, and demand for the Companys drilling services remains challenging. The Company had all of its actively marketed deep and mid water semisubmersibles in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico ("U.S. GOM") operating during at least part of the fourth quarter of 2003. However, these semisubmersibles continue to work under well to well contracts and dayrates are currently flat. For the Companys jack up fleet in the U.S. GOM, dayrates and utilization improved significantly during 2003 compared to 2002 and this market continues to do well as the effect of high gas prices and the repositioning of jack ups to the Mexican Gulf of Mexico have had a positive effect. However, the Company can make no assurances that these favorable market conditions will persist. In the North Sea, the Company has two of its three semisubmersibles committed through most of 2004 and a fourth North Sea rig, the Ocean Nomad has moved to West Africa where it is contracted to operate through the middle of the year. The Company is actively pursuing opportunities for the Ocean Vanguard, which is currently stacked at Invergordon. In Southeast Asia, all of the Companys semisubmersibles are committed through mid year. In addition, the Ocean Sovereign, a jack up, will operate in Indonesia through the end of the first quarter, and the Ocean Heritage has mobilized to Ecuador where it is operating under a three well contract. In Brazil, the Company renewed its contracts for two of its semisubmersibles, although the renewal dayrates for the Ocean Yatzy and the Ocean Winner were lower than previous contracts that were set during a peak market cycle. Both of these semisubmersibles will begin required surveys during the first quarter of 2004. The Company also successfully renewed the contract for the Ocean Clipper drillship in Brazil at the same dayrate as the units previous contract. All of the new Brazilian contracts are for 700 days each. Although the Company is encouraged by the currently favorable outlook in its international markets, the Company offers no assurance that a favorable outcome will be achieved. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues. The Companys revenues vary based upon demand, which affects the number of days the fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned. When a rig is idle, generally no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result. Revenues can also increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs, required surveys and shipyard upgrades. In order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates, the Company may mobilize its rigs from one market to another. However, during periods of unpaid mobilization, revenues may be adversely affected. As a response to changes in demand, the Company may withdraw a rig from the market by cold stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously, which may decrease or increase revenues, respectively. Revenues from dayrate drilling contracts are recognized currently. The Company may receive lump sum payments in connection with specific contracts. Such payments are recognized as revenues over the term of the related drilling contract. Mobilization revenues, in excess of costs incurred to mobilize an offshore rig from one market to another, are recognized over the primary term of the related drilling contract. Revenues from reimbursements received for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services and other services provided at the request of the customer in accordance with a contract or agreement are recorded for the gross amount billed to the customer, as "Revenues related to reimbursable expenses" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenues from offshore turnkey drilling contracts are accrued to the extent of costs until the specified turnkey depth and other contract requirements are met. Income is recognized on the completed contract method. Provisions for future losses on turnkey contracts are recognized when it becomes apparent that expenses to be incurred on a specific contract will exceed the revenue from that contract. The Company has 12 elected not to pursue contracts for integrated services, which includes turnkey contracts, except in very limited circumstances. Operating Income. Operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors, but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses. Operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and may not be significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or "ready stacked" state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, the Company is responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract. However, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, the Company may reduce the size of a rigs crew and take steps to "cold stack" the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income. The Company recognizes as operating expenses activities such as inspections, painting projects and routine overhauls, which meet certain criteria, that maintain rather than upgrade its rigs. These expenses vary from period to period. Costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements. Higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades. Operating income is negatively impacted when the Company performs certain regulatory inspections that are due every five years ("5 year survey") for all of the Companys rigs. Operating revenue decreases because these surveys are performed during scheduled down time in a shipyard. Operating expenses increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs. Repair and maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory down time. The number of rigs undergoing a 5 year survey will vary from year to year. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Companys significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 of its Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Managements judgments, assumptions and estimates are inherent in the preparation of the Companys financial statements and the application of its significant accounting policies. The Company believes that its most critical accounting estimates are as follows: Property, Plant and Equipment. Drilling and other property and equipment is carried at cost. Maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments, which meet certain criteria, are capitalized. Depreciation is amortized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives. In April 2003 the Company commissioned a study to evaluate the economic lives of its drilling rigs. As a result of this study, effective April 1, 2003, the Company recorded changes in accounting estimates by increasing the estimated service lives to 25 years for jack ups and 30 years for semisubmersibles and the Companys drillship and by increasing salvage values to 5% for most of the Companys drilling rigs. The change in estimate was made to better reflect the remaining economic lives and salvage values of the Companys fleet. The effect of this change in accounting estimate resulted in an increase to net income (after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2003 of $20.4 million, or $0.16 per share. Management makes judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization, useful lives and salvage values. Changes in these assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. The Company evaluates its property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In September 2003 the Company wrote down two of its second generation semisubmersible drilling rigs, the Ocean Century and the Ocean Prospector, by $1.6 million to their fair market values subsequent to a decision to offer the rigs for sale. These rigs were sold in December 2003 for $375,000 each (pre tax). Managements assumptions are an inherent part of an asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. 13 Personal Injury Claims. The Companys retention of liability for personal injury claims, which primarily result from Jones Act liability in the Gulf of Mexico, is $0.5 million per claim with an additional aggregate annual deductible of $1.5 million. The Company estimates its liability for personal injury claims based on the existing facts and circumstances in conjunction with historical experience regarding past personal injury claims. Eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ significantly from the estimated amounts. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year; and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in its financial statements or tax returns. The application of this accounting standard requires that management make judgments regarding future events and related estimations especially as they pertain to forecasting of the Companys effective tax rate, the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits, and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit. In 2003 a valuation allowance of $10.2 million, which resulted in a charge against earnings, was established for certain of the Companys foreign tax credit carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2006. Although the Company intends to make use of all available tax planning strategies in order to be able to utilize these carryforwards, under the "more likely than not" approach of evaluating the associated deferred tax asset the Company deemed that a valuation allowance was necessary. 14 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002 Comparative data relating to the Companys revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below (eliminations offset (i) dayrate revenues earned when the Companys rigs are utilized in its integrated services and (ii) intercompany expenses charged to rig operations). Certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed. Such reclassifications do not affect earnings.

Revenues from high specification floaters decreased $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the same period in 2002. Lower average operating dayrates for most of the rigs in this classification resulted in a $39.0 million reduction in revenue. Average operating dayrates fell from $109,500 during 2002 to $95,300 (excluding the 15 Ocean Rover) during 2003. Significant reductions in average operating dayrates were experienced by certain rigs located in: SOUTHEAST ASIA: the Ocean Baroness ($149,800 to $104,100); U.S. GULF OF MEXICO: the Ocean Valiant ($81,400 to $52,600); and the Ocean Victory ($96,800 to $66,600). An overall improvement in utilization for high specification floaters during 2003 contributed $18.7 million to revenues and partially offset the negative effect of lower average operating dayrates. Utilization improved to 87% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 83% for the same period in 2002 (excluding the Ocean Rover). Utilization improved for: the Ocean America, which worked most of 2003 but was stacked for almost half of 2002; the Ocean Baroness, which worked most of 2003 but spent most of the first quarter of 2002 in a shipyard completing its upgrade to high specification capabilities; and the Ocean Star, which worked all of 2003 but was stacked four months during the same period in 2002. Partially offsetting the overall improvement in utilization was a decline in utilization for the Ocean Valiant, which was stacked in 2003 for approximately three more months than in 2002. The unfavorable revenue variance for high specification rigs in 2003 compared to 2002 was also partially offset by $12.7 million in revenue contributed by the Ocean Rover, which began its drilling program offshore Malaysia in July 2003 upon completion of its upgrade to high specification capabilities. The rig spent all of 2002 undergoing its upgrade. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for high specification floaters for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $3.7 million compared to the same period in 2002. Higher contract drilling expenses were primarily due to: operating costs for the Ocean Baroness, which worked most of the current year compared to 2002 when the rig began operations late in the first quarter upon completion of its upgrade; operating costs associated with the Ocean Rover, which began operating in July 2003 compared to 2002, when most of this rigs costs were capitalized in connection with its upgrade; and mobilization, 5 year survey and repair costs incurred by the Ocean Valiant during 2003. These higher contract drilling expenses were partially offset by lower expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to: higher costs incurred during 2002 for the recovery of the Ocean Baronesss marine riser, net of costs charged to an associated insurance claim; and 5 year survey and repair costs for the Ocean Victory and the Ocean Star incurred during 2002. OTHER SEMISUBMERSIBLES. Revenues. Revenues from other semisubmersibles for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $57.1 million lower compared to the same period in 2002. 16 A decline in the average operating dayrate (excluding the Ocean Patriot and the Ocean Vanguard), from $67,900 during 2002 to $60,900 during 2003, resulted in lower revenues of $42.5 million. The most significant decreases in average operating dayrates were to certain rigs located in: the North Sea: the Ocean Guardian ($90,300 to $53,700); the Ocean Princess ($72,700 to $40,900); the Ocean Nomad ($64,800 to $42,700); and SOUTHEAST ASIA: the Ocean General ($75,100 to $54,200). Lower utilization of 57% (excluding the Ocean Patriot and the Ocean Vanguard) during 2003 compared to 61% during 2002 resulted in a $27.3 million revenue decrease. Utilization declined primarily due to: the Ocean Epoch, which was stacked the majority of 2003 but worked most of 2002; the Ocean Guardian and the Ocean Yorktown, which were each stacked approximately three months during 2003 compared to 2002 when both rigs worked most of the year; and the Ocean Liberator, which was cold stacked all of 2003 but worked approximately three months during 2002. Partially offsetting the decline in revenue in 2003 compared to 2002 were improvements in revenue from: the Ocean Worker which worked most of 2003 but spent approximately three months in 2002 in a shipyard for its 5 year survey and repairs; and $12.7 million contributed by the Ocean Vanguard and the Ocean Patriot, which the Company acquired in December 2002 and March 2003, respectively. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for other semisubmersibles during the year ended December 31, 2003 was higher by $16.4 million compared to the same period in 2002 primarily due to additional costs during 2003 associated with: the Ocean Vanguard and the Ocean Patriot, which the Company acquired in December 2002 and March 2003, respectively; the mobilization of the Ocean Worker, Ocean Ambassador, Ocean Yorktown and the Ocean Whittington to Mexico in 2003; the inspection of the Ocean Guardian; and the 5 year surveys of the Ocean Ambassador, Ocean Nomad and the Ocean Bounty during 2003. Partially offsetting the higher contract drilling expenses during 2003 were lower expenses from the Ocean Liberator, Ocean New Era, Ocean Voyager and the Ocean Endeavor which were cold stacked all of 2003 but were ready stacked during most or part of 2002. JACK UPS. Revenues. Revenues from jack ups decreased $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the same period in 2002. Utilization fell to 68% during 2003 from 71% during 2002, resulting in a $6.3 million reduction in revenue. The decline in utilization was primarily from: the Ocean Sovereign, which spent most of 2003 in a shipyard completing its leg extension upgrade but operated offshore Indonesia all of 2002; and 17 the Ocean Titan, which was in a Gulf of Mexico shipyard from May 2003 through December 2003 for a cantilever conversion but worked almost all of the same period in 2002. The lower overall revenue in 2003 was partially offset by a $13.6 million increase in revenue due to utilization improvements from: the Ocean Spartan, Ocean Spur and the Ocean Heritage, which operated most of 2003 but were undergoing leg extension upgrades during 2002; and the Ocean Crusader, which worked almost all of 2003 but was stacked approximately three months in 2002. Also offsetting the unfavorable revenue variance for jack up rigs was an overall improvement in the average operating dayrate, from $27,300 during 2002 to $28,100 during 2003, which increased revenue by $4.7 million in 2003. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for jack ups during 2003 increased $4.6 million from 2002 primarily due to: operating costs incurred in 2003 for the Ocean Spartan, Ocean Spur, Ocean Tower and the Ocean Heritage compared to 2002 costs that were capitalized in connection with their leg extension upgrades; and costs associated with the 5 year surveys of the Ocean Drake and Ocean Warwick in 2003. Partially offsetting the higher contract drilling expenses were: reduced costs for the Ocean Champion, which was cold stacked all of 2003 but only part of 2002; and reduced costs for the Ocean Titan due to the capitalization of most costs during its cantilever upgrade, which began in the second quarter of 2003 and continued through its completion in January 2004. INTEGRATED SERVICES. Integrated services had an operating loss of $0.5 million in 2003 comprised of project income of $0.4 million from the completion of one turnkey plug and abandonment project in the Gulf of Mexico during the first quarter of 2003 that was more than offset by operating overhead costs. During 2002, an operating loss of $0.6 million resulted primarily from an unprofitable turnkey project in the Gulf of Mexico. The Company has elected not to pursue contracts for integrated services except in very limited circumstances. OTHER. Other operating expense of $136,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, decreased $7.4 million compared to operating income of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2003 other operating expense of $2.4 million was primarily due to the write off of a contract dispute with a customer and a reserve for pending litigation. These operating expenses in 2003 were partially offset by operating income of $2.3 million primarily from the reimbursement of foreign taxes paid by the Companys customers on its behalf, settlements with the Companys customers related to prior years disputes and the reversal of a reserve related to a prior year customer contract audit. Other operating income of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, resulted primarily from a $5.9 million reimbursement of prior year foreign income tax to be received by the Company from its customers and related to a tax settlement made between the Company and the Norwegian tax authorities in December 2002. The corresponding income tax expense is reflected in "Income tax benefit (expense)" in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. Other operating income in 2002 also included a $2.4 million reversal of an accrual made in a prior year for personal injury claims and the elimination of a $1.0 million reserve for inventory obsolescence, from prior years, that was deemed no longer necessary. 18 REIMBURSABLE EXPENSES, NET. Reimbursable expenses include items that the Company purchases, and or services it performs, at the request of its customers. Revenues related to reimbursable items, offset by the related expenditures for these items, were $2.8 million in 2003 compared to $2.5 million in 2002. DEPRECIATION. Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2003, decreased $1.9 million to $175.6 million compared to $177.5 million in 2002. A $22.9 million pre tax reduction in depreciation expense resulted from increasing the estimated service lives and salvage values of most of the Companys drilling rigs, effective April 1, 2003, to better reflect their remaining economic lives and salvage values. This decrease was partially offset by additional depreciation from the Ocean Vanguard and the Ocean Patriot, which the Company acquired in December 2002 and March 2003, respectively. Depreciation also increased due to additional depreciation for five of the Companys recently upgraded jack up rigs, additional depreciation for the Ocean Rover, which completed its upgrade in July 2003 and additional depreciation for the Ocean Baroness, which completed its upgrade in March 2002. (LOSS) GAIN ON SALE AND DISPOSITION OF ASSETS. A loss on the sale and disposition of assets of $0.9 million occurred during 2003 primarily due to the sale of two of the Companys second generation semisubmersible drilling rigs, the Ocean Century and Ocean Prospector. These rigs, which had been cold stacked since July 1998 and October 1998, respectively, were permanently retired from service as offshore drilling rigs and written down by $1.6 million to their fair market values in September 2003 and subsequently sold for $375,000 each (pre tax) in December 2003. A gain on the sale of assets of approximately $84,000 occurred in 2002. INTEREST INCOME. Interest income of $12.0 million earned in 2003 declined $17.8 million, from $29.8 million earned in 2002. These earnings were lower primarily due to lower interest rates earned on cash and marketable securities compared to 2002 and less cash investment during 2003. (LOSS) GAIN ON SALE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES. A loss on the sale of marketable securities of $6.9 million occurred in 2003 compared to a $36.5 million gain on the sale of marketable securities in 2002. See Note 3 "Marketable Securities" in Item 8 of this report. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE (OTHER, NET). Other income of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $1.4 million from other income of $1.5 million for the same period in 2002. Other income for both years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was primarily from a pre tax gain on foreign exchange forward contracts of $2.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively. See Note 4 " Derivative Financial Instruments Forward Exchange Contracts" to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. INCOME TAX BENEFIT (EXPENSE). An income tax benefit of $5.8 million was recognized on a pre tax loss of $54.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to tax expense of $33.7 million recognized on pre tax income of $96.2 million in 2002. In 2002 the Company formed a Cayman Island corporation, Diamond Offshore International Limited, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Certain of the Companys rigs that operate internationally are now owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company began to postpone remittance of the earnings from this subsidiary to the U.S. 19 and to indefinitely reinvest these earnings internationally. Consequently, no U.S. taxes were provided on these earnings and no U.S. tax benefits were recognized on losses during 2003. In 2003 a valuation allowance of $10.2 million, which resulted in a charge against earnings, was established for certain of the Companys foreign tax credit carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2006. Although the Company intends to make use of all available tax planning strategies in order to be able to utilize these carryforwards, under the "more likely than not" approach of evaluating the associated deferred tax asset the Company deemed that a valuation allowance was necessary. In addition, in 2003 the Company reduced its deferred tax liability by $3.7 million related to the deductibility of goodwill associated with a 1996 acquisition. In the first quarter of 2002, a portion of the earnings from the Companys U.K. subsidiaries was considered to be indefinitely reinvested and no U.S. taxes were provided on those earnings. The effect of the indefinite reinvestment of the U.K. earnings in 2002 was to lower the annual effective tax rate but this decline was more than offset by prior year foreign tax expense recorded in 2002, primarily $5.9 million for a Norwegian income tax settlement. See " Other." These U.K. subsidiaries are now owned, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited. Consequently, earnings and losses from the U.K. subsidiaries for 2003 are part of the earnings and losses of the Cayman Island subsidiary on which no U.S. taxes are provided. 20 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001 Comparative data relating to the Companys revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below (eliminations offset (i) dayrate revenues earned when the Companys rigs are utilized in its integrated services and (ii) intercompany expenses charged to rig operations). Certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed. Such reclassifications do not affect earnings.

Revenues. Despite the rise in oil and natural gas prices that began in late 2001 and continued throughout 2002, improvements in dayrates and utilization for the Companys equipment did not materialize. As a result, revenues from high specification floaters decreased $35.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2002 from the same period in 2001. 21 Revenue generated from the operation of the Ocean Baroness in 2002 of $35.7 million partially offset revenue shortfalls caused by lower average dayrates and utilization for this fleet during the year ended 2002. The Ocean Baroness began operations in mid March 2002 after completing an upgrade to high specification capabilities. The rig was in a Singapore shipyard undergoing its upgrade throughout 2001. Excluding the Ocean Baroness, average operating dayrates dropped from $117,700 per day during 2001 to $105,500 per day during 2002 resulting in a $38.7 million revenue decline. Significant declines to average operating dayrates were experienced by the following rigs (all located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico): the Ocean Valiant ($122,900 to $81,400); the Ocean Victory ($124,100 to $96,800); the Ocean America ($108,300 to $84,400); and the Ocean Star ($104,200 to $87,100). Utilization declined from 95% in 2001 to 83% in 2002 resulting in a $32.0 million decrease in revenue (excluding the Ocean Baroness). Significant utilization reductions resulted from: the Ocean America, which was idle for approximately five months during 2002 but worked most of 2001; the Ocean Star, which spent three and one half months during 2002 in a shipyard for its 5 year survey and repairs but worked all of 2001; and the Ocean Victory which spent two months during 2002 in a shipyard for its 5 year survey and repairs but worked all of 2001. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for high specification floaters during the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $29.3 million from the same period in 2001. Higher contract drilling expenses were primarily due to: operating expenses for the Ocean Baroness of $16.7 million for 2002 which included costs incurred in connection with the recovery of its marine riser, net of insurance recoveries, as well as its normal operating costs; 5 year surveys and repairs of the Ocean Star, Ocean Victory, and the Ocean Quest in 2002 which increased expenses by $4.9 million; higher Brazilian customs fees in 2002 of $1.3 million for the importation of spare parts and supplies for the Ocean Alliance and the Ocean Clipper; approximately $1.0 million for repairs to the Ocean America including boat and fuel costs while the rig was idle during 2002; and higher comparative costs in 2002 for the Ocean Clipper resulted from a $1.8 million reduction in an insurance deductible, which lowered overall operating costs in 2001. OTHER SEMISUBMERSIBLES. Revenues. Revenues from other semisubmersibles decreased $60.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the same period of 2002. Lower utilization accounted for $38.4 million of the decrease, dropping to 61% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 70% for the same period in 2001. Significant declines in utilization were experienced by: the Ocean Voyager and the Ocean Endeavor both of which have been cold stacked since March 2002 but worked the majority of 2001; the Ocean New Era which was idle or cold stacked all of 2002 but worked almost half of 2001; 22 the Ocean Worker which was in a shipyard for a 5 year survey and repairs during part of 2002 but worked most of 2001; and the Ocean Saratoga which was in a shipyard for its 5 year survey during part of 2002 but worked most of 2001. Partially offsetting the negative impact of these declines in utilization was an improvement in utilization for the Ocean Bounty, which operated most of 2002 compared to 2001 when the rig was stacked for approximately two months. Lower overall average dayrates caused $22.0 million of the unfavorable variance in other semisubmersibles revenue. However, the average operating dayrate for this fleet increased to $67,900 during the year ended December 31, 2002 from $66,900 during the same period of 2001. This occurred because several of the rigs that were contracted at lower dayrates in 2001 were stacked throughout parts of 2002. Consequently, the average operating dayrate rose in 2002 for the working rigs in this class. Rigs in this fleet with significant changes to average operating dayrates were experienced by certain rigs located in the: U.S. GULF OF MEXICO: the Ocean Worker ($127,700 to $49,800); AFRICA: the Ocean Whittington, which operated in Brazil during 2001 ($89,800 to $59,100); NORTH SEA: the Ocean Guardian ($62,000 to $90,300); and the Ocean Princess ($51,800 to $72,700). Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for other semisubmersibles was $12.1 million lower in 2002 than in 2001 primarily due to: cost savings of $14.5 million in 2002 from the Ocean Endeavor and the Ocean Voyager, both of which have been cold stacked since March 2002; a $4.3 million reduction in 2002 costs resulting from the Ocean New Era and the Ocean Ambassador which were stacked with reduced crews for most of 2002; and contract drilling expenses lower by $2.8 million in 2002 for the Ocean Whittington compared to 2001 expenses which included a 5 year survey, repairs and preparation for its mobilization from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to Namibia in December 2001. Partially offsetting the overall lower contract drilling expenses in 2002 were: higher operating costs ($3.0 million) for the Ocean Nomad compared to 2001 operating costs which were lower because this rig was in a shipyard being upgraded; additional expenses ($2.1 million) in 2002 due to a 5 year survey and repairs to the Ocean Worker; and additional expenses ($1.4 million) in 2002 from higher Brazilian customs fees for the importation of spare parts and supplies for the Ocean Yatzy, Ocean Yorktown and the Ocean Winner. JACK UPS. Revenues. Revenues from jack ups during the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $75.1 million from the same period of 2001. 23 A reduction in the average operating dayrate from $41,000 in 2001 to $27,300 in 2002, contributed $48.6 million to the overall revenue decline. All of the Gulf of Mexico jack up rigs experienced lower average operating dayrates in 2002. Only the Ocean Heritage, a rig which operated offshore Indonesia and Australia, experienced a significant improvement in its dayrate, from $34,700 in 2001 to $85,100 in 2002. Revenues decreased $26.5 million from a decline in utilization from 83% in 2001 to 71% in 2002 primarily due to: the Ocean Champion, which was idle and or cold stacked throughout 2002, but worked most of 2001; and the Ocean Spartan, Ocean Spur, Ocean Tower and the Ocean Heritage all of which spent time in shipyards undergoing upgrades during 2002 but worked most of 2001. The unfavorable utilization variance in 2002 was partially offset by higher revenue for the Ocean Sovereign which worked all of 2002 but spent most of 2001 in a shipyard for repairs. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for jack ups decreased $17.7 million in 2002 compared to 2001. Significant reductions in 2002 expenses were as follows: $8.2 million for the Ocean Spartan, Ocean Spur, Ocean Tower and the Ocean Heritage resulting from reduced operating costs while these rigs were in shipyards undergoing upgrades; $8.0 million for the Ocean Champion which was idle and or cold stacked during all of 2002 but worked most of 2001; and lower comparative costs in 2002 for the Ocean Nugget, Ocean Crusader, and the Ocean Summit due to repairs that contributed to higher contract drilling expenses during the first half of 2001. Partially offsetting the lower contract drilling expenses in 2002 were higher costs from the mobilization of the Ocean Heritage from Indonesia to Australia and higher labor costs in Australia. INTEGRATED SERVICES. Operating income for integrated services decreased $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the same period of 2001 resulting from the difference in type and magnitude of projects during those periods. During 2002, an operating loss of $0.6 million resulted primarily from an unprofitable turnkey project in the Gulf of Mexico. During the same period in 2001, operating income of $0.6 million was primarily due to the completion of one international turnkey project and three turnkey permanent plug and abandonment projects in the Gulf of Mexico. OTHER. Other operating income of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $9.3 million from the same period in 2001. The increase resulted primarily from a $5.9 million reimbursement of prior year foreign income tax to be received by the Company from its customers and relates to a tax settlement made between the Company and the Norwegian tax authorities in December 2002. The corresponding income tax expense is reflected in "Income tax benefit (expense)" in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. Also contributing to the higher "Other operating income" in 2002 was a $2.4 million reversal of an accrual made in a prior year for personal injury claims and the elimination of a $1.0 million reserve for inventory obsolescence, from prior years, that was deemed no longer necessary. REIMBURSABLES, NET. Revenues related to reimbursable items that the Company purchases and or services it performs at the request of its customers offset by the related expenditures for these items were $2.5 million in 2002 compared to $2.8 million in 2001. 24 DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $7.5 million over the same period of 2001. Higher 2002 depreciation resulted primarily from depreciation for 2002 capital additions and additional depreciation for the Ocean Baroness, which completed its deepwater upgrade and began operations in March 2002. The suspension of goodwill amortization on January 1, 2002 partially offset this increase. Goodwill amortization during the year ended December 31, 2001 was $3.3 million. See Note 1 " Goodwill" and Note 6 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. General and administrative expense was $3.5 million higher in 2002 than in the comparable period in 2001 primarily due to higher personnel costs and professional expenses, including legal fees, tax and accounting fees and security consulting. INTEREST INCOME. Interest income of $29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $18.9 million from $48.7 million for the same period in 2001 primarily due to a reduction in marketable securities held and lower interest rates earned on cash and marketable securities in 2002 compared to 2001. INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense of $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $14.5 million lower than in the same period of 2001 primarily due to an $11.9 million pre tax charge that resulted from the April 2001 redemption of the Companys 3.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes Due 2007 ("3.75% Notes"). In addition, the Companys weighted average interest rate in 2002 was lower than in 2001 resulting from the redemption in 2001 of the 3.75% Notes and the issuance of the 1.5% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2031 (the "1.5% Debentures") on April 11, 2001. Interest expense was also lower in 2002 than in 2001 due to more interest capitalized to rig upgrades in 2002. Interest capitalized to rig upgrades was $2.9 million in 2002 compared to $2.6 million in 2001. In 2002 interest was capitalized to the Ocean Baroness during the final three months of its upgrade and during the entire year for the Ocean Rover. See " Liquidity." GAIN ON SALE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES. Gain on sale of marketable securities of $36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $9.4 million from $27.1 million for the same period in 2001. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE (OTHER, NET). Other income of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $4.2 million from other expense of $2.7 million for the same period in 2001. Other income in 2002 included a $1.1 million pre tax gain on foreign exchange forward contracts. See Note 4 " Derivative Financial Instruments Forward Exchange Contracts" to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Other expense in 2001 included a $10.0 million reserve established for a class action lawsuit which was ultimately settled in June 2002 and was partially offset by a $7.3 million receipt for the settlement of an unrelated lawsuit. INCOME TAX EXPENSE. Income tax expense of $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $53.0 million from $86.7 million for the same period in 2001 primarily as a result of a $164.3 million decrease in "Income before income tax expense" in 2002. The annual effective tax rate increased from 33% in 2001 to 35% in 2002. In 2001 the Company made the decision to indefinitely reinvest part of the earnings of its U.K. subsidiaries and the annual effective rate for the year 2001 reflects this decision. The effect of the indefinite reinvestment of the U.K. earnings in 2002 was to lower the annual effective tax rate but this decline was more than offset by prior 25 year foreign tax expense recorded in 2002, primarily $5.9 million for a Norwegian income tax settlement. See " Other." LIQUIDITY A discussion of the sources and uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 follows.

During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, cash was provided by the net sale and maturity of certain of the Companys investments in marketable securities, the settlement of forward contracts at favorable exchange rates and the sale of miscellaneous equipment. Cash used during 2003 was for the purchase of the semisubmersible rig, Omega, renamed the Ocean Patriot, and capital expenditures primarily to complete the upgrade of the Ocean Rover and the upgrades of three of the Companys jack up rigs. During the year ended December 31, 2002, $199.1 million was used for the repurchase of securities sold under repurchase agreements in 2001 and $273.8 million was used for capital expenditures (primarily the Ocean Baroness and Ocean Rover upgrades). There were no outstanding loaned 26 debt securities sold under repurchase agreements at December 31, 2003. In December 2002 the Company spent $68.5 million ($67.0 million excluding inventory) for the purchase of the Ocean Vanguard. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS) NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES Payment of dividends............................... $(57,022) $ (65,685) $ 8,663 Acquisition of treasury stock......................

(1,193) 1,193 $(86,388) $(120,728) $34,340 The Company paid cash dividends of $57.0 million to stockholders in 2003 compared to $65.7 million in 2002. Cash dividends paid in 2003 were lower primarily due to a reduction in the dividend rate for dividends paid in December 2003 ($0.0625 per share of common stock) compared to the dividend rate used for payments made in March, June and September of 2003 ($0.125 per share of common stock). The Company reduced the dividend rate due to declines in earnings and in an effort to maintain the Companys strong liquidity position. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company purchased 1,014,000 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $18.2 million, or at an average cost of $17.96 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company purchased 1,716,700 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $43.4 million, or at an average cost of $25.30 per share. This includes the Companys purchase of 500,000 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $20.0 million, or $40.00 per share, upon the exercise of put options sold in February 2001. See " Treasury Stock and Common Equity Put Options" in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report. Depending on market conditions, the Company may, from time to time, purchase shares of its common stock or issue put options in the open market or otherwise. Cash used in financing activities in 2003 and 2002 included payments of $11.2 million and $10.4 million, respectively, in accordance with the Companys December 2000 lease leaseback agreement with a European bank. As of December 31, 2003, three of five annual installments of $13.7 million each (including principal and interest) had been made. The lease leaseback agreement provided for the Company to lease the Ocean Alliance, one of the Companys high specification semisubmersible drilling rigs, to the bank for a lump sum payment of $55.0 million plus an origination fee of $1.1 million and for the bank to then sub lease the rig back to the Company. This financing agreement has an effective interest rate of 7.13% and is an unsecured obligation of the Company. Cash was also used during 2002 for payments totaling $1.2 million for the settlement of put options which covered 1,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock. The options gave the holders the right to require the Company to repurchase up to the contracted number of shares of its common stock at the stated exercise price per share at any time prior to their expiration. The Company had the option to settle in cash or shares of its common stock. Put options sold in 2001, which covered 187,321 shares of the Companys common stock, expired during 2002. See " Treasury Stock and Common Equity Put Options" in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report. 27 CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS.

Payments of the Companys long term debt, including interest, could be accelerated due to certain rights that holders of the Companys debentures have to put the securities to the Company. See discussion below. 1.5% DEBENTURES The Companys $460.0 million principal amount of 1.5% Debentures that it issued on April 11, 2001 are due April 15, 2031. The 1.5% Debentures are convertible into shares of the Companys common stock at an initial conversion rate of 20.3978 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company has the right to deliver cash in lieu of shares of the Companys common stock. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their 1.5% Debentures on April 15, 2008, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or shares of the Companys common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. In addition, holders may require the Company to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their 1.5% Debentures upon a change in control (as defined). The Company may redeem all or a portion of the 1.5% Debentures at any time on or after April 15, 2008, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. ZERO COUPON DEBENTURES The Companys Zero Coupon Debentures issued on June 6, 2000 at a price of $499.60 per $1,000 debenture, which represents a yield to maturity of 3.50% per year, are due June 6, 2020. The Company will not pay interest prior to maturity unless it elects to convert the Zero Coupon Debentures to interest bearing debentures upon the occurrence of certain tax events. The Zero Coupon Debentures are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into the Companys common stock at a fixed conversion rate of 8.6075 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Zero Coupon Debentures, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The Zero Coupon Debentures are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company has the right to redeem the Zero Coupon Debentures, in whole or in part, after June 6, 2005, for a price equal to the issuance price plus accrued original issue discount through the date of redemption. Holders have the right to require the Company to repurchase the Zero Coupon Debentures on the fifth, tenth and fifteenth anniversaries of issuance at the accreted value through the date of repurchase. The Company may pay such repurchase price with either cash or shares of the Companys common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. 28 The aggregate principal amount at maturity will be $805.0 million assuming no conversions or redemptions occur prior to the maturity date. LETTERS OF CREDIT. The Company is contingently liable as of December 31, 2003 in the amount of $69.0 million under certain performance, bid, customs and export bonds. On the Companys behalf, banks have issued letters of credit securing certain of these bonds. Agreements with these banks contain terms that allow the banks to require cash collateralization of the entire line for any reason. CREDIT RATINGS. As of the date of this report, the Companys current credit rating is Baa1 for Moodys Investors Services ("Moodys") and A for Standard & Poors. In 2003 Moodys lowered its ratings of the Companys long term debt to Baa1 from A3. In addition, Standard & Poors placed ratings of the Companys debt under review for a possible downgrade. Moodys lowered the Companys ratings primarily due to financial performance that was below Moodys expectations to be considered an A3 rating level. Although the Companys long term ratings continue at investment grade levels, lower ratings could result in higher interest rates on future debt issuances. OTHER. The Company has the ability to issue an aggregate of approximately $117.5 million in debt, equity and other securities under a shelf registration statement. In addition, the Company may issue, from time to time, up to eight million shares of common stock, shares which are registered under an acquisition shelf registration statement (upon effectiveness of an amendment thereto reflecting the effect of the two for one stock split declared in July 1997), in connection with one or more acquisitions by the Company of securities or assets of other businesses. At December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, the Company had no off balance sheet debt. The Company believes it has the financial resources needed to meet its business requirements in the foreseeable future, including capital expenditures for rig upgrades and continuing rig enhancements, and working capital requirements. CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash required to meet the Companys capital commitments is determined by evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating the Companys ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, including water depth and drilling capability upgrades. It is managements opinion that operating cash flows and the Companys cash reserves will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments; however, the Company will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions. In addition, the Company may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. The Companys ability to effect any such issuance will be dependent on the Companys results of operations, its current financial condition, current market conditions and other factors beyond its control. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company spent $102.7 million, including capitalized interest expense, for rig upgrades, of which $67.0 million was for the deepwater upgrade of the Ocean Rover and $35.7 million was for the upgrade of six of the Companys jack up rigs. The Company has budgeted approximately $15 million during 2004 to upgrade one of the Companys high specification semisubmersible units, the Ocean America with capabilities making it more suitable for developmental drilling. 29 The upgrade of the Ocean Rover, which began in January 2002, was completed early in July 2003 on time and under budget. The project was completed for approximately $188 million, below managements original estimated cost of $200 million. The rig commenced its contract with Murphy Sabah Oil Company, Ltd. on July 10, 2003 for a minimum three well drilling program offshore Malaysia. The Companys two year program to expand the capabilities of its jack up fleet by significantly upgrading 6 of its 14 jack up rigs has been completed. Three of these upgrades were completed in 2002, two were completed in 2003 and the one was completed early in 2004. The Ocean Sovereign, a 250 foot water depth independent leg cantilever rig prior to the upgrade, completed leg extension installations in May 2003 allowing the rig to work in water depths up to 300 feet. The cost of this upgrade was approximately $11 million. The Ocean Tower, a 350 foot water depth capability independent leg slot rig prior to its upgrade, completed its cantilever upgrade in March 2003 for approximately $27 million. The installation of a cantilever package on the Ocean Titan was completed in early 2004 for approximately $22 million. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company spent $105.8 million on its continuing rig capital maintenance program (other than rig upgrades) and to meet other corporate capital expenditure requirements. In addition, the Company spent $65.0 million ($63.5 million capitalized to rig equipment) for the purchase of the third generation semisubmersible drilling rig, Omega, renamed the Ocean Patriot. The Company has budgeted $66 million for 2004 capital expenditures associated with its ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs and other corporate requirements. The Company expects to finance its 2004 capital expenditures through the use of existing cash balances or internally generated funds. OTHER Currency Risk. Certain of the Companys subsidiaries use the local currency in the country where they conduct operations as their functional currency. Currency environments in which the Company has material business operations include Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. When possible, the Company attempts to minimize its currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to the Companys estimated operating costs payable in local currency with the balance of the contract payable in U.S. dollars. At present, however, only a limited number of the Companys contracts are payable both in U.S. dollars and the local currency. The Company has not hedged its exposure to changes in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and the local currencies but it may seek to do so in the future. Currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate section of stockholders equity. When the Company ceases its operations in a currency environment, the accumulated adjustments are recognized currently in results of operations. The effect on results of operations from these translation gains and losses has not been material and are not expected to have a significant effect in the future. Forward Exchange Contracts. In some instances, a foreign exchange forward contract is used to minimize the forward exchange risk. A forward exchange contract obligates the Company to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specified dates. In June 2002 the Company entered into forward contracts to purchase 50.0 million Australian dollars, 4.2 million Australian dollars to be purchased monthly from August 29, 2002 through June 26, 2003 and 3.8 million Australian dollars to be purchased on July 31, 2003. In July 2001 the Company entered into 12 forward contracts to purchase 3.5 million Australian dollars at each month end through July 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had satisfied all obligations under these contracts and has not entered into any new forward exchange contracts. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In May 2003 the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." This statement requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is 30 within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. It is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of SFAS No. 150 and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption. Restatement is not permitted. The Companys adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In April 2003 the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is to be applied prospectively for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. For contracts involving hedging relationships, SFAS No. 149 should be applied to both existing contracts and new contracts entered into after June 30, 2003. The Companys adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time to time by the Company or its representatives are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward looking statements.

Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, the following: general economic and business conditions; worldwide demand for oil and natural gas; changes in foreign and domestic oil and gas exploration, development and production activity; oil and natural gas price fluctuations and related market expectations; the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly called OPEC, to set and maintain production levels and pricing, and the level of production in non OPEC countries; policies of the various governments regarding exploration and development of oil and gas reserves; advances in exploration and development technology; the political environment of oil producing regions; casualty losses; operating hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore; industry fleet capacity; market conditions in the offshore contract drilling industry, including dayrates and utilization levels; competition; changes in foreign, political, social and economic conditions; risks of international operations, compliance with foreign laws and taxation policies and expropriation or nationalization of equipment and assets; risks of potential contractual liabilities pursuant to the Companys various drilling contracts in effect from time to time; foreign exchange and currency fluctuations and regulations, and the inability to repatriate income or capital; risks of war, military operations, other armed hostilities, terrorist acts and embargoes; changes in offshore drilling technology, which could require significant capital expenditures in order to maintain competitiveness; 32 regulatory initiatives and compliance with governmental regulations; compliance with environmental laws and regulations; customer preferences; effects of litigation; cost, availability and adequacy of insurance; adequacy of the Companys sources of liquidity; risks inherent in turnkey operations, including the risk of failure to complete a well and cost overruns; the availability of qualified personnel to operate and service the Companys drilling rigs; and various other matters, many of which are beyond the Companys control. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report and the Companys other filings with the SEC include additional factors that could adversely affect the Companys business, results of operations and financial performance. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. Forward looking statements included in this report speak only as of the date of this report. The Company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement to reflect any change in the Companys expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward looking statement is based. 33 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The information included in this Item 7A is considered to constitute "forward looking statements" for purposes of the statutory safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. See "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements" in Item 7 of this report. The Companys measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of its financial instruments. Market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by the Company at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. The Company believes that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since the Companys investment portfolio is subject to change based on its portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur. Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management. Senior management approves the overall investment strategy employed by the Company and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to it. The Company may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions. INTEREST RATE RISK The Company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. The Companys investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities. The Company monitors its sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of its financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates. The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of the Companys investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity. The analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of the Companys financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which the Company believes are reasonably possible over a one year period. The sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of the Companys interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly, the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the Companys earnings or stockholders equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions the Company could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. The Companys long term debt, as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 is denominated in U.S. dollars. The Companys debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates, and as such, interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of $150.5 million and $153.8 million, respectively. A 100 basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of $186.8 million and $192.7 million, respectively. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. In mid 2002 the Company had contracted to purchase approximately 50.0 million Australian dollars, 4.2 million Australian dollars to be purchased monthly from August 29, 34 2002 through June 26, 2003, and 3.8 million Australian dollars to be purchased on July 31, 2003. These foreign exchange forward contracts are recorded at their fair value determined by discounting future cash flows at current forward rates. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had satisfied all obligations under these contracts and has not entered into any new forward exchange contracts. At December 31, 2002, an asset of $0.2 million reflecting the fair value of the forward contracts was included with "Prepaid expenses and other" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 20% change in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their levels at December 31, 2002, with all other variables held constant. The following table presents the Companys market risk by category (interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates): FAIR VALUE ASSET (LIABILITY) MARKET RISK DECEMBER 31, DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 2003 2002 (IN THOUSANDS) CATEGORY OF RISK EXPOSURE: Interest rate:...................... Marketable securities............. $503,995(a) $ 627,614(a) $700(c) $21,500(c) Long term debt.................... (909,100)(b) (901,800)(b) Foreign Exchange.................... 151 2,300(d) (a) The fair market value of the Companys investment in marketable securities is based on the quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002. (b) The fair values of the Companys 1.5% Debentures due 2031 and zero coupon convertible debentures due 2020 are based on the quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002. The fair value of the Companys Ocean Alliance lease leaseback agreement is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 2.08% for December 31, 2003 and 6.62% for December 31, 2002. (c) The calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002. (d) The calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of a decrease in foreign exchange rates of 20% at December 31, 2002. 35
