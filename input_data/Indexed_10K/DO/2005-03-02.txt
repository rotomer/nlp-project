Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements (including the Notes thereto) in Item 8 of this report. Overview Results of Operations and Industry Conditions The overall market for the Companys mid water and deepwater semisubmersible rigs improved dramatically beginning in the third quarter of 2004 and extending into 2005. The increase in demand, which resulted from a combination of customer recognition of high oil and gas prices, increasing oil consumption and declining reserves, among other things, lifted dayrates around the world, but had the greatest impact in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea two markets where the Company has a significant presence. The Companys jack up fleet also experienced steady growth in utilization and dayrates throughout 2004. Improving Markets Gulf of Mexico. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, commitments for Diamond Offshores high specification rigs have reached as high as $150,000 per day for work beginning in mid 2005 and extending into the first quarter of 2006. This contrasts with dayrates in the $60,000 range earned during the first half of 2004. All six of the Companys high specification semisubmersible rigs in the U.S. GOM are currently contracted with backlogs extending at least until the third quarter of 2005 at progressively higher dayrates than previous contracts. In addition, the dayrate for the Companys four mid water semisubmersibles operating in the GOM has reached as high as $110,000 for work beginning in early September 2005, with backlog also building in this market at improving dayrates. This contrasts with dayrates in the $40,000 range earned during the first half of 2004. The improving dayrates and high committed utilization were factors in the Companys decision to reactivate the previously cold stacked Ocean Voyager for the mid water U.S. GOM market. The Ocean Voyager, which resumed work in mid December 2004, is earning a dayrate of $73,000 as of the date of this report and has future commitments to work at dayrates ranging from $95,000 to $110,000 beginning in the second quarter of 2005. The Company views the deepwater and mid water markets in the GOM as under supplied, and believes that additional improvement in utilization, backlog and dayrates is likely in these market segments during 2005. The Companys jack up fleet in the GOM also continued to experience high utilization and improving dayrates during 2004 and into early 2005. The Company views the jack up market in the U.S. GOM as currently tightly balanced, with effective utilization near 100 percent and demand sporadically exceeding supply. As a result, the Company believes the market and dayrates for this class of equipment could improve further in the near term. In the Mexican GOM, the Companys four semisubmersible rigs that mobilized to that market in the latter half of 2003 continued to operate throughout 2004 under long term contracts and remain contracted for that market throughout 2005. The Company believes that future work for other of its semisubmersibles and jack ups in this market is limited. The Company views the market for the Mexican GOM as in balance and expects it to remain so this year. Brazil. Two of the Companys four rigs operating in Brazil, one of which is a high specification semisubmersible, have contracts that expire in the third quarter of 2005. These units were contracted prior to the mid year market improvement and the Company will seek to obtain new contracts for these rigs reflective of market conditions. The Company views the Brazilian semisubmersible market as firm and expects it to remain so during 2005. North Sea. Drilling activity in the North Sea mirrored that in the Gulf of Mexico in 2004. Demand and pricing accelerated in the second half of 2004, and utilization of marketed semisubmersible rigs in the U.K. sector of the North Sea reached 100 percent by the end of June 2004. The Ocean Guardian and Ocean Princess, which began the year earning dayrates between $40,000 and $50,000, each received one year extensions to their contracts in the U.K. at $80,000 per day. The Ocean Vanguard began work at mid year in 14 Table of Contents the U.K. sector for a start up rate of $30,000 per day. The unit then mobilized to Norway late in 2004, where it began an approximately 15 month series of contracts for a dayrate in the low $140,000s. Also responding to the strong demand in the North Sea, the Ocean Nomad returned to the U.K. from West Africa and is operating under a one year contract, also at $80,000 per day. Effective utilization of marketed semisubmersible rigs in both the U.K and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea remains at 100 percent, and the Company believes this market will remain firm throughout the balance of 2005. In February 2005, the Company reached an agreement with a customer to upgrade the Ocean Guardian to high pressure, high temperature capabilities. The upgrade is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of 2005 and is estimated to cost approximately $5.0 million, which will be paid by the customer, in part by a lump sum payment of $3.5 million with the remainder to be recovered through dayrate increases over a minimum of 120 days. Southeast Asia. The Companys two high specification semisubmersibles operating in Southeast Asia received new contracts in the first quarter of 2005. The Ocean Baroness was awarded a one year contract at a dayrate of approximately $200,000 for work in the Gulf of Mexico beginning early in the fourth quarter of 2005. The unit is expected to begin a 90 120 day mobilization back to the U.S. at the conclusion of its current contract in May 2005. Additionally, the Ocean Rover received a 950 day extension to its current contract at a dayrate averaging in the mid $170,000s. The new dayrates contrast with rates in the mid $130,000s and mid $120,000s, respectively, for the rigs previous contracts. All of the Companys other semisubmersible rigs in the Southeast Asian market currently have contracts or commitments for work extending at least into mid 2005 at favorable market dayrates. The Company views demand in the Southeast Asian market as increasing, and with high utilization, the Company believes dayrates could continue improving. General Revenues. The Companys revenues vary based upon demand, which affects the number of days the fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned. When a rig is idle, no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result. Revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs, required surveys and shipyard upgrades. In order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates, the Company may mobilize its rigs from one market to another. However, during periods of mobilization, revenues may be adversely affected. As a response to changes in demand, the Company may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously, which may decrease or increase revenues, respectively. The two most significant variables affecting revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates, each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace. As utilization rates increase, dayrates tend to increase as well reflecting the lower supply of available rigs, and vice versa. The same factors, primarily demand for drilling services, which is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development as well as a variety of political and economic factors, and availability of rigs in a particular geographical region, affect both dayrates and utilization rates. These factors are not within the Companys control and are difficult to predict. Revenue from dayrate drilling contracts is recognized as services are performed. In connection with such drilling contracts, the Company may receive lump sum fees for the mobilization of equipment. These fees are earned as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. The Company previously accounted for the excess of mobilization fees received over costs incurred to mobilize an offshore rig from one market to another as revenue over the term of the related drilling contracts. Effective July 1, 2004 the Company changed its accounting to defer mobilization fees received as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred and began to amortize each, on a straight line basis, over the term of the related drilling contracts (which is the period estimated to be benefited from the mobilization activity). Straight line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts (which generally range from two to 60 months) is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed. If the Company had used this method of accounting in prior periods, operating income (loss) and net income (loss) would not have changed and the impact on contract drilling revenues and expenses would have been immaterial. Absent a contract, mobilization costs are recognized currently. 15 Table of Contents Reimbursements received for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services and other services provided at the request of the Companys customers in accordance with a contract or agreement are recorded for the gross amount billed to the customer, as Revenues related to reimbursable expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue from offshore turnkey drilling contracts are accrued to the extent of costs until the specified turnkey depth and other contract requirements are met. Income is recognized on the completed contract method. Provisions for future losses on turnkey contracts are recognized when it becomes apparent that expenses to be incurred on a specific contract will exceed the revenue from that contract. The Company has elected not to pursue contracts for integrated services, which includes turnkey contracts, except in very limited circumstances. Operating Income. Operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors, but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses. Operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and may not be significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or ready stacked state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, the Company is responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract. However, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, the Company may reduce the size of a rigs crew and take steps to cold stack the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income. The Company recognizes, as incurred, operating expenses related to activities such as inspections, painting projects and routine overhauls that meet certain criteria and, which maintain rather than upgrade its rigs. These expenses vary from period to period. Costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements. Higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades. Operating income is negatively impacted when the Company performs certain regulatory inspections (5 year surveys) that are due every five years for all of the Companys rigs. Operating revenue decreases because these surveys are performed during scheduled down time in a shipyard. Operating expenses increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs. Repair and maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory down time. The number of rigs undergoing a 5 year survey will vary from year to year. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 of its Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Managements judgments, assumptions and estimates are inherent in the preparation of the Companys financial statements and the application of its significant accounting policies. The Company believes that its most critical accounting estimates are as follows: Property, Plant and Equipment. Drilling and other property and equipment is carried at cost. Maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments, which meet certain criteria, are capitalized. Depreciation is amortized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives. Management makes judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization, useful lives and salvage values. Changes in these judgments, assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported. The offshore drilling industry is a relatively young industry which began developing just over 50 years ago. The Company has based its estimates of useful lives and salvage values on the historical industry data available to it as well as its own experience. In April 2003 the Company commissioned a study to evaluate the economic lives of its drilling rigs because several of its rigs had reached or were approaching the end of their depreciable lives, yet were still operating and were expected to operate for many more years. As a result of this study, effective April 1, 2003, the Company recorded changes in accounting estimates by increasing the estimated service lives to 25 years for jack ups and 30 years for semisubmersibles and the Companys drillship and by increasing salvage values to 5% for most of the Companys drilling rigs. The change in estimate was 16 Table of Contents made to better reflect the remaining economic lives and salvage values of the Companys fleet. The effect of this change in accounting estimate resulted in a reduction to the Companys net loss for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 of $19.6 million, or $0.15 per share, and $14.9 million, or $0.11 per share, respectively. The Company evaluates its property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company utilizes a probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. The assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include (a) dayrate by rig, (b) utilization rate by rig (expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used), (c) the per day operating cost for each rig if active, ready stacked or cold stacked and (d) salvage value for each rig. Based on these assumptions and estimates a matrix is developed assigning probabilities to various combinations of assumed utilization rates and dayrates. The impact of a 5% reduction in assumed dayrates for the cold stacked rigs (holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant), or alternatively the impact of a 5% reduction in utilization (again holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant) is also considered as part of this analysis. At December 31, 2004, the Company considered its three cold stacked rigs for impairment testing and determined that none of the drilling units was impaired. On January 10, 2005, the Company announced that one of its cold stacked rigs, the Ocean Endeavor, would be upgraded to a high specification drilling unit for an estimated cost of $250 million. As a result of this decision and the low net book value of this rig, the Company does not consider this asset to be impaired. At December 31, 2004, the Company had elected to market one of its cold stacked rigs, the Ocean Liberator, for sale to a third party and classified the rig as an asset held for sale in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet included in Item 8 of this report. The estimated market value of this rig, based on offers from third parties, is higher than its current carrying value; therefore, no write down was deemed necessary as a result of the reclassification to held for sale. The remaining cold stacked rig was evaluated for impairment using the probability weighted cash flow analysis discussed above. At December 31, 2004 the probability weighted cash flow for the Ocean New Era significantly exceeded its net carrying value of $3.2 million. At December 31, 2003 the Company determined that all five of its cold stacked rigs should be tested for impairment. The impairment analysis at December 31, 2003 consisted of a probability weighted cash flow analysis for each of the five cold stacked rigs. In all cases, the probability weighted cash flows significantly exceeded the carrying value of each rig. Two of the Companys cold stacked rigs that were tested and found not to be impaired at December 31, 2003 were subsequently reactivated and these rigs currently have contracted dayrates that are within the range of dayrates used in the Companys 2003 impairment analysis. Managements assumptions are an inherent part of an asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. Personal Injury Claims. The Companys uninsured retention of liability for personal injury claims, which primarily results from Jones Act liability in the Gulf of Mexico, is $0.5 million per claim with an additional aggregate annual deductible of $1.5 million. The Companys in house claims department estimates the amount of its liability for its retention. This department establishes a reserve for each of the Companys personal injury claims by evaluating the existing facts and circumstances of each claim and comparing the circumstances of each claim to historical experiences with similar past personal injury claims. The claims department also estimates the Companys liability for claims which are incurred but not reported by using historical data. Historically, the Companys ultimate liability for personal injury claims has not differed materially from the Companys recorded estimates. At December 31, 2004 the Companys estimated liability for personal injury claims was $33.4 million. Due to uncertainties such as (a) the severity of personal injuries claimed, (b) significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims, (c) the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated, (d) inconsistent court decisions and (e) the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation, eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from the estimated amounts. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of 17 Table of Contents the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year; and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in its financial statements or tax returns. In each of its tax jurisdictions the Company recognizes a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if necessary, which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach. For interim periods, the Company estimates its annual effective tax rate by forecasting its annual income before income tax, taxable income and tax expense in each of its tax jurisdictions. The Company makes judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to forecasting of the Companys effective tax rate, the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits, and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit. Certain of the Companys foreign tax credit carryforwards are scheduled to expire in 2011. Although the Company intends to make use of all available tax planning strategies in order to be able to utilize these carryforwards, under the more likely than not approach of evaluating the associated deferred tax asset the Company determined that a valuation allowance was necessary. In December 2003 the Company established a valuation allowance of $10.2 million, which resulted in a charge against earnings. At December 31, 2004, the Companys valuation allowance related to the potential realization of deferred tax assets was $10.3 million. 18 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 Comparative data relating to the Companys revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below (eliminations offset (i) dayrate revenues earned when the Companys rigs are utilized in its integrated services and (ii) intercompany expenses charged to rig operations). Certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed. Such reclassifications do not affect earnings.

Revenues. Revenues from high specification floaters decreased $9.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the same period in 2003. 19 Table of Contents Utilization fell to 80% during 2004 from 87% in 2003 (excluding the Ocean Rover) and negatively impacted revenue by $24.6 million. Each of the following rigs operated during all or most of 2003 but their utilization in 2004 declined primarily due to: the Ocean Alliance, which was off contract for most of the first half of 2004, including four months of downtime due to a series of sub sea and electrical problems following approximately one month in a shipyard for a 5 year survey and sub sea equipment upgrade; the Ocean Star, which was ready stacked during the first five months of 2004; the Ocean Confidence, which had approximately three more weeks of unpaid downtime in 2004 than in 2003, for sub sea repairs and an inspection in 2004; and the Ocean America, which spent 101 days in a shipyard undergoing a 5 year survey and upgrade which were completed late in the second quarter of 2004. Partially offsetting the overall decline in utilization were improvements in utilization from the Ocean Valiant, which operated all of 2004, compared to 2003, when this rig was in a shipyard for approximately three months for a 5 year survey and scheduled maintenance. Lower overall average operating dayrates in 2004, as compared to 2003, resulted in a $6.0 million reduction in revenue. Average operating dayrates fell to $90,300 during 2004 from $95,300 during 2003 (excluding the Ocean Rover). The lower average dayrates in 2004 were primarily the result of soft market conditions in the U.S. GOM in the first half of 2004 as several of these high specification floaters accepted jobs in the mid water depth market. The unfavorable revenue variance for high specification rigs in 2004 compared to 2003 was also partially offset by $22.7 million in additional revenue in 2004 contributed by the Ocean Rover as it continued its drilling program offshore Malaysia. This rig commenced drilling operations in July 2003 after completion of its upgrade to high specification capabilities which began in 2002. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for high specification floaters for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $15.3 million compared to the same period in 2003. Higher contract drilling expenses were primarily due to: operating costs for the Ocean Rover, which worked all of 2004 compared to 2003, when most of this rigs costs were capitalized in connection with its upgrade; 2004 costs for repairs to the Ocean Alliance due to a series of sub sea and electrical problems and a 5 year survey; and costs associated with damages from Hurricane Ivan to the Ocean America and Ocean Star during the latter half of 2004. Partially offsetting the overall higher contract drilling expenses during 2004 were lower expenses for the Ocean Valiant, which incurred higher costs during 2003 for a 5 year survey and maintenance repairs. Other Semisubmersibles. Revenues. Revenues from other semisubmersibles for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $58.8 million compared to the same period in 2003. Improvements in utilization contributed $43.0 million to the higher revenues in 2004. Utilization rose to 75% during 2004 (excluding the Ocean Liberator) compared to 64% in 2003 (excluding the Ocean Century, Ocean Prospector, Ocean Liberator and Ocean Vanguard). Utilization improved for: the Ocean Whittington, Ocean Epoch and Ocean Princess, all of which worked a majority of 2004 but were ready stacked for most of 2003; 20 Table of Contents the Ocean Ambassador, which worked throughout 2004 but was in a shipyard for approximately four months during 2003 for a 5 year survey and preparing for its contract in Mexico, which commenced in late July 2003; the Ocean Guardian, which worked most of 2004 but was stacked approximately three months during 2003; the Ocean Bounty, which worked all of 2004 compared to 2003 when this rig was in a shipyard for almost two months for a 5 year survey and related repairs; and the Ocean Yorktown, which operated offshore Brazil until July 2003 when it was relocated to the GOM. This rig began operation for PEMEX in the Mexican GOM in the mid fourth quarter of 2003 and remained under contract throughout 2004. These utilization improvements were partially offset by a decline in utilization for the Ocean Concord, which was stacked for six months in 2004 for a 5 year survey and various repairs. The rig then entered a shipyard for life enhancement maintenance, as compared to 2003 when it worked most of the year. The average operating dayrate for other semisubmersibles fell from $57,800 during 2003 (excluding the Ocean Vanguard) to $56,500 during 2004, reducing revenues by $7.2 million. The most significant reductions in average operating dayrates were to: the Ocean Yatzy (from $118,600 to $84,900), which renewed its contract to operate offshore Brazil during the latter part of 2003 at a lower dayrate reflective of market conditions at the time; and the Ocean Yorktown (from $64,800 to $46,500), which worked offshore Brazil during the first half of 2003 but operated in the Mexican GOM during 2004. Partially offsetting the overall lower average operating dayrates was an improvement in the average operating dayrate for the Ocean Worker (from $55,700 to $67,000). The Ocean Worker operated in the Mexican GOM throughout 2004. In 2003 the rig operated in the U.S. GOM for seven months at a lower average dayrate before moving to the Mexican GOM. Revenues for the Ocean Vanguard improved $13.8 million in 2004 compared to 2003 due to a higher average operating dayrate in 2004. This semisubmersible rig had an average operating dayrate of $77,300 during 2004, compared to $10,000 in 2003 which was earned under a bareboat charter. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for other semisubmersibles increased $47.9 million during 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to: the Ocean Vanguard, which incurred higher operating expenses during 2004 compared to 2003 (when the rig operated under a bareboat charter to its previous owner at reduced operating costs), including costs associated with preparing the rig for work in the North Sea; the Ocean Voyager, which was reactivated from cold stack status during the fourth quarter of 2004; higher operating expenses associated with rigs working in the Mexican GOM throughout 2004, including additional equipment rental expense in connection with the rigs contracts with PEMEX, travel costs and costs associated with maintaining a Mexican shorebase, as compared to 2003 when two of these rigs operated in the U.S. GOM, and another rig was stacked in Africa for the first five months of the year; the Ocean Epoch, which incurred normal operating costs as it worked most of 2004 compared to reduced costs while it was ready stacked during most of 2003; the Ocean Patriot, which incurred higher than normal operating costs during 2004 due to preparation for work in New Zealand and Australia, including mobilization of the rig from South Africa, compared to normal operating costs during the same period in 2003 following its March 2003 purchase; and the Ocean Guardian and Ocean Princess, both of which incurred higher labor costs in 2004 associated with mandated labor benefits legislated in the U.K. 21 Table of Contents Partially offsetting the increase in contract drilling expense in 2004 were lower costs compared to 2003 due to: lower 5 year survey, inspection and repair costs for the Ocean Bounty, Ocean Guardian and Ocean Princess in 2004 compared to 2003; and mobilization costs in 2003 associated with the four rigs operating in the Mexican GOM. Jack Ups. Revenues. Revenues from jack ups increased $80.6 million during 2004 compared to 2003. The average operating dayrate for jack ups rose to $37,800 in 2004 from $28,100 in 2003 resulting in a $34.3 million improvement in revenues. All of the Companys jack ups in the GOM experienced an increase in average dayrate primarily due to a tighter market for this class of equipment in the U.S. GOM. Utilization rose to 86% during 2004 from 68% during 2003, resulting in a $35.4 million increase in revenue. Significant increases in utilization were primarily due to: the Ocean Tower and Ocean Titan in the U.S. GOM, and the Ocean Sovereign in Southeast Asia, which were in shipyards undergoing major upgrades during a significant portion of 2003, but were operating during most of 2004. Utilization for these rigs increased to 96% in 2004 compared to 39% in 2003; the Ocean Champion, which was reactivated from cold stack status during 2004; and the Ocean Heritage, Ocean Summit, Ocean Spartan, Ocean Columbia and Ocean Drake, all of which worked a majority of 2004 compared to each being stacked for periods ranging from two to five months in 2003. Utilization for these five rigs increased to 91% in 2004 as compared to 74% in 2003. Partially offsetting the improvement in utilization was: the Ocean Nugget, which was stacked for almost two months during 2004 for a spud can inspection and related repair work compared to working most of 2003; and the Ocean Warwick, which was in a shipyard for all of the fourth quarter of 2004 undergoing repairs to damages caused by Hurricane Ivan, compared to working most of 2003. In addition, revenues in 2004 included $10.9 million related to the amortization of lump sum mobilization fees. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for jack ups during 2004 increased $17.2 million from 2003 primarily due to: higher operating and mobilization costs for the Ocean Heritage during 2004, compared to reduced expenses during 2003 while this rig was stacked in a Singapore shipyard for six months; higher operating costs for the Ocean Sovereign, which was working in 2004 compared to 2003 when a majority of expenditures were capitalized as part of its upgrade; reactivation and operating costs for the Ocean Champion, compared to cold stack costs during 2003; and operating costs for the Ocean Titan during 2004, compared to 2003 when most of this rigs costs were capitalized in connection with its cantilever upgrade. Partially offsetting the higher contract drilling expenses in 2004 were higher comparative expenses during 2003 for: the Ocean Summit and Ocean Spartan, each of which was stacked for two and one half months in 2003; and costs associated with the 5 year survey of the Ocean Drake in 2003. 22 Table of Contents Reimbursable expenses, net. Revenues related to reimbursable items, offset by the related expenditures for these items, were $3.4 million in 2004 compared to $2.8 million in 2003. Reimbursable expenses include items that the Company purchases, and or services it performs, at the request of its customers. The Company charges its customers for purchases and or services performed on their behalf at cost, plus a mark up where applicable. Therefore, net reimbursables fluctuate based on customer requirements which vary. Depreciation. Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $3.2 million to $178.8 million, compared to $175.6 million in 2003, primarily due to additional depreciation expense associated with: the Ocean Rover, which completed its upgrade in July 2003; the Ocean Patriot, acquired in March 2003; upgrades to three jack up rigs, two of which were completed during the second quarter of 2003 and one which was completed in early 2004; and capital expenditures in the third quarter 2003 related to contracts for four of the Companys rigs in Mexico. Partially offsetting the increases noted above was higher depreciation expense of $5.3 million during the first quarter of 2003 prior to the Companys adjustment of the estimated service lives and salvage values for most of its drilling rigs, effective April 1, 2003, to better reflect their remaining economic lives and salvage values. See Critical Accounting Estimates. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense for 2004 of $32.8 million increased $3.9 million, as compared to $28.9 million for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher payroll costs, costs related to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, higher external audit fees and higher net building expenses due to lower rental income from tenants. Loss on Sale and Disposition of Assets. The $1.6 million loss on the sale and disposition of assets in 2004 primarily related to the write off of equipment that was lost during Hurricane Ivan. The loss on the sale and disposition of assets of $0.9 million during 2003 primarily related to the sale of two of the Companys semisubmersible drilling rigs, the Ocean Century and Ocean Prospector. These rigs, which had been cold stacked since July 1998 and October 1998, respectively, were permanently retired from service as offshore drilling rigs and written down by $1.6 million to their fair market values in September 2003 and subsequently sold for $375,000 each (pre tax) in December 2003. Interest Expense. Interest expense of $30.3 million in 2004 was $6.4 million higher than interest expense of $23.9 million in 2003 primarily due to interest on the 5.15% Senior Notes issued August 27, 2004 and lower interest expense in 2003 as a result of interest capitalized relating to the upgrade of the Ocean Rover which was completed in July 2003. See Note 1 General Information Capitalized Interest and Note 7 Long Term Debt in Item 8 of this report. Gain (Loss) on Sale of Marketable Securities. A gain on the sale of marketable securities of $0.3 million occurred in 2004 compared to a $6.9 million loss on the sale of marketable securities in 2003. See Note 3 Marketable Securities in Item 8 of this report. 23 Table of Contents Settlement of Litigation The Company recognized an $11.4 million gain as a result of the settlement of its lawsuit against an equipment manufacturer. The lawsuit was the result of an incident that had occurred in 2002 on the Ocean Baroness. Other Income and Expense (Other, net). Other income of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 included $1.4 million in foreign currency transaction losses Other income of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 related primarily to pre tax gains on foreign exchange forward contracts. See Note 4 Derivative Financial Instruments Forward Exchange Contracts to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Income Tax (Expense) Benefit. Net income tax benefit (expense) is a function of the mix between the Companys domestic and international pre tax earnings (losses), as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Income tax expense of $3.7 million was recognized on a pre tax loss of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to a tax benefit of $5.8 million recognized on a pre tax loss of $54.2 million in 2003. In 2002 the Company formed a Cayman Island corporation, Diamond Offshore International Limited, which is a wholly owned subsidiary. Certain of the Companys rigs that operate internationally are now owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company began to postpone remittance of the earnings from this subsidiary to the U.S. and to indefinitely reinvest these earnings internationally. Consequently, no U.S. taxes were provided on these earnings and no U.S. tax benefits were recognized on losses during 2004 or 2003. The Company recognized tax expense of $3.7 million for 2004 despite a $3.5 million pre tax loss primarily as a result of $20.5 million of unrepatriated losses in international tax jurisdictions for which no U.S benefits were recognized. Tax expense for 2004 also included $2.5 million associated with a revision to estimates in tax balance sheet accounts, a tax benefit of $5.2 million related to goodwill arising from the merger with Arethusa (Off Shore) Limited in 1996 and a tax benefit of $4.5 million due to the reversal of a tax liability associated with the Ocean Alliance Lease Leaseback. In 2003 a valuation allowance of $10.2 million, which resulted in a charge against earnings, was established for certain of the Companys foreign tax credit carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2011. Although the Company intends to make use of all available tax planning strategies in order to be able to utilize these carryforwards, under the more likely than not approach of evaluating the associated deferred tax asset the Company determined that a valuation allowance was necessary. In addition, in 2003 the Company reduced its deferred tax liability by $3.7 million related to the deductibility of goodwill associated with a 1996 acquisition. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA includes a provision allowing a deduction of 85% for certain foreign earnings that are repatriated. The AJCA provides the Company the opportunity to elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in 2005. Based on the existing language in the AJCA and current guidance, the Company does not expect to repatriate undistributed earnings. To the extent Congress or the Treasury Department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision, the Company will consider the effects, if any, of such information and will re evaluate, as necessary, its intentions with respect to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. Should the Company, upon consideration of any such potential clarifying language, ultimately elect to apply the repatriation provision of the AJCA, the Company does not expect that the impact of such an election would be material to its results of operations. 24 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 Comparative data relating to the Companys revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below (eliminations offset (i) dayrate revenues earned when the Companys rigs are utilized in its integrated services and (ii) intercompany expenses charged to rig operations). Certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed. Such reclassifications do not affect earnings.

Revenues. Revenues from high specification floaters decreased $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the same period in 2002. Lower average operating dayrates for most of the rigs in this classification resulted in a $39.0 million reduction in revenue. Average operating dayrates fell from $109,500 during 2002 to $95,300 (excluding the 25 Table of Contents Ocean Rover) during 2003. Significant reductions in average operating dayrates were experienced by certain rigs located in: Southeast Asia: the Ocean Baroness ($149,800 to $104,100); U.S. Gulf of Mexico: the Ocean Valiant ($81,400 to $52,600); and the Ocean Victory ($96,800 to $66,600). An overall improvement in utilization for high specification floaters during 2003 contributed $18.7 million to revenues and partially offset the negative effect of lower average operating dayrates. Utilization improved to 87% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 83% for the same period in 2002 (excluding the Ocean Rover). Utilization improved for: the Ocean America, which worked most of 2003 but was stacked for almost half of 2002; the Ocean Baroness, which worked most of 2003 but spent most of the first quarter of 2002 in a shipyard completing its upgrade to high specification capabilities; and the Ocean Star, which worked all of 2003 but was stacked four months during the same period in 2002. Partially offsetting the overall improvement in utilization was a decline in utilization for the Ocean Valiant, which was stacked in 2003 for approximately three more months than in 2002. The unfavorable revenue variance for high specification rigs in 2003 compared to 2002 was also partially offset by $12.7 million in revenue contributed by the Ocean Rover, which began its drilling program offshore Malaysia in July 2003 upon completion of its upgrade to high specification capabilities. The rig spent all of 2002 undergoing its upgrade. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for high specification floaters for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $3.7 million compared to the same period in 2002. Higher contract drilling expenses were primarily due to: operating costs for the Ocean Baroness, which worked most of the current year compared to 2002 when the rig began operations late in the first quarter upon completion of its upgrade; operating costs associated with the Ocean Rover, which began operating in July 2003 compared to 2002, when most of this rigs costs were capitalized in connection with its upgrade; and mobilization, 5 year survey and repair costs incurred by the Ocean Valiant during 2003. These higher contract drilling expenses were partially offset by lower expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to: higher costs incurred during 2002 for the recovery of the Ocean Baronesss marine riser, net of costs charged to an associated insurance claim; and 5 year survey and repair costs for the Ocean Victory and the Ocean Star incurred during 2002. Other Semisubmersibles. Revenues. Revenues from other semisubmersibles for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $57.1 million lower compared to the same period in 2002. 26 Table of Contents A decline in the average operating dayrate (excluding the Ocean Patriot and the Ocean Vanguard), from $67,900 during 2002 to $60,900 during 2003, resulted in lower revenues of $42.5 million. The most significant decreases in average operating dayrates were to certain rigs located in: the North Sea: the Ocean Guardian ($90,300 to $53,700); the Ocean Princess ($72,700 to $40,900); the Ocean Nomad ($64,800 to $42,700); and Southeast Asia: the Ocean General ($75,100 to $54,200). Lower utilization of 57% (excluding the Ocean Patriot and the Ocean Vanguard) during 2003 compared to 61% during 2002 resulted in a $27.3 million revenue decrease. Utilization declined primarily due to: the Ocean Epoch, which was stacked the majority of 2003 but worked most of 2002; the Ocean Guardian and the Ocean Yorktown, each of which was stacked approximately three months during 2003 compared to 2002 when both rigs worked most of the year; and the Ocean Liberator, which was cold stacked all of 2003 but worked approximately three months during 2002. Partially offsetting the decline in revenue in 2003 compared to 2002 were improvements in revenue from: the Ocean Worker, which worked most of 2003 but spent approximately three months in 2002 in a shipyard for its 5 year survey and repairs; and $12.7 million contributed by the Ocean Vanguard and the Ocean Patriot, which the Company acquired in December 2002 and March 2003, respectively. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for other semisubmersibles during the year ended December 31, 2003 was higher by $16.4 million compared to the same period in 2002 primarily due to additional costs during 2003 associated with: the Ocean Vanguard and the Ocean Patriot, which the Company acquired in December 2002 and March 2003, respectively; the mobilization of the Ocean Worker, Ocean Ambassador, Ocean Yorktown and Ocean Whittington to Mexico in 2003; the inspection of the Ocean Guardian; and the 5 year surveys of the Ocean Ambassador, Ocean Nomad and Ocean Bounty during 2003. Partially offsetting the higher contract drilling expenses during 2003 were lower expenses from the Ocean Liberator, Ocean New Era, Ocean Voyager and Ocean Endeavor, which were cold stacked all of 2003 but were ready stacked during most or part of 2002. Jack Ups. Revenues. Revenues from jack ups decreased $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the same period in 2002. Utilization fell to 68% during 2003 from 71% during 2002, resulting in a $6.3 million reduction in revenue. The decline in utilization was primarily from: the Ocean Sovereign, which spent most of 2003 in a shipyard completing its leg extension upgrade but operated offshore Indonesia all of 2002; and 27 Table of Contents the Ocean Titan, which was in a Gulf of Mexico shipyard from May 2003 through December 2003 for a cantilever conversion but worked almost all of the same period in 2002. The lower overall revenue in 2003 was partially offset by a $13.6 million increase in revenue due to utilization improvements from: the Ocean Spartan, Ocean Spur and Ocean Heritage, which operated during most of 2003 but were undergoing leg extension upgrades during 2002; and the Ocean Crusader, which worked almost all of 2003 but was stacked approximately three months in 2002. Also offsetting the unfavorable revenue variance for jack up rigs was an overall improvement in the average operating dayrate, from $27,300 during 2002 to $28,100 during 2003, which increased revenue by $4.7 million in 2003. Contract Drilling Expense. Contract drilling expense for jack ups during 2003 increased $4.6 million from 2002 primarily due to: operating costs incurred in 2003 for the Ocean Spartan, Ocean Spur, Ocean Tower and Ocean Heritage compared to 2002 costs that were capitalized in connection with their leg extension upgrades; and costs associated with the 5 year surveys of the Ocean Drake and Ocean Warwick in 2003. Partially offsetting the higher contract drilling expenses were: reduced costs for the Ocean Champion, which was cold stacked all of 2003 but only part of 2002; and reduced costs for the Ocean Titan due to the capitalization of most costs during its cantilever upgrade, which began in the second quarter of 2003 and continued through its completion in January 2004. Integrated Services. Integrated services had an operating loss of $0.5 million in 2003 comprised of project income of $0.4 million from the completion of one turnkey plug and abandonment project in the Gulf of Mexico during the first quarter of 2003 that was more than offset by operating overhead costs. During 2002, an operating loss of $0.6 million resulted primarily from an unprofitable turnkey project in the Gulf of Mexico. The Company has elected not to pursue contracts for integrated services except in very limited circumstances. Other. Other operating expense of $136,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $7.4 million compared to operating income of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2003 other operating expense of $2.4 million was primarily due to the write off of a contract dispute with a customer and a reserve for pending litigation. These operating expenses in 2003 were partially offset by operating income of $2.3 million primarily from the reimbursement of foreign taxes paid by the Companys customers on its behalf, settlements with the Companys customers related to prior years disputes and the reversal of a reserve related to a prior year customer contract audit. Other operating income of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 resulted primarily from a $5.9 million reimbursement of prior year foreign income tax to be received by the Company from its customers and related to a tax settlement made between the Company and the Norwegian tax authorities in December 2002. The corresponding income tax expense is reflected in Income tax benefit (expense) in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. Other operating income in 2002 also included a $2.4 million reversal of an accrual made in a prior year for personal injury claims and the elimination of a $1.0 million reserve for inventory obsolescence, from prior years, that was deemed no longer necessary. 28 Table of Contents Reimbursable expenses, net. Reimbursable expenses include items that the Company purchases, and or services it performs, at the request of its customers. Revenues related to reimbursable items, offset by the related expenditures for these items, were $2.8 million in 2003 compared to $2.5 million in 2002. Depreciation. Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $1.9 million to $175.6 million compared to $177.5 million in 2002. A $22.9 million pre tax reduction in depreciation expense resulted from increasing the estimated service lives and salvage values of most of the Companys drilling rigs, effective April 1, 2003, to better reflect their remaining economic lives and salvage values. This decrease was partially offset by additional depreciation from the Ocean Vanguard and the Ocean Patriot, which the Company acquired in December 2002 and March 2003, respectively. Depreciation also increased due to additional depreciation for five of the Companys recently upgraded jack up rigs, additional depreciation for the Ocean Rover, which completed its upgrade in July 2003 and additional depreciation for the Ocean Baroness, which completed its upgrade in March 2002. (Loss) Gain on Sale and Disposition of Assets. A loss on the sale and disposition of assets of $0.9 million occurred during 2003 primarily due to the sale of two of the Companys semisubmersible drilling rigs, the Ocean Century and Ocean Prospector. These rigs, which had been cold stacked since July 1998 and October 1998, respectively, were permanently retired from service as offshore drilling rigs and written down by $1.6 million to their fair market values in September 2003 and subsequently sold for $375,000 each (pre tax) in December 2003. A gain on the sale of assets of approximately $84,000 occurred in 2002. Interest Income. Interest income of $12.0 million earned in 2003 declined $17.8 million, from $29.8 million earned in 2002. These earnings were lower primarily due to lower interest rates earned on cash and marketable securities compared to 2002 and less cash investment during 2003. (Loss) Gain on Sale of Marketable Securities. A loss on the sale of marketable securities of $6.9 million occurred in 2003 compared to a $36.5 million gain on the sale of marketable securities in 2002. See Note 3 Marketable Securities in Item 8 of this report. Other Income and Expense (Other, net). Other income of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $1.4 million from other income of $1.5 million for the same period in 2002. Other income for both years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was primarily from a pre tax gain on foreign exchange forward contracts of $2.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively. See Note 4 Derivative Financial Instruments Forward Exchange Contracts in Item 8 of this report. Income Tax Benefit (Expense). An income tax benefit of $5.8 million was recognized on a pre tax loss of $54.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to tax expense of $33.7 million recognized on pre tax income of $96.2 million in 2002. In 2002 the Company formed a Cayman Island corporation, Diamond Offshore International Limited, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Certain of the Companys rigs that operate internationally are now owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company began to postpone remittance of the earnings from this subsidiary to the U.S. 29 Table of Contents and to indefinitely reinvest these earnings internationally. Consequently, no U.S. taxes were provided on these earnings and no U.S. tax benefits were recognized on losses during 2003. In 2003 a valuation allowance of $10.2 million, which resulted in a charge against earnings, was established for certain of the Companys foreign tax credit carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2011. Although the Company intends to make use of all available tax planning strategies in order to be able to utilize these carryforwards, under the more likely than not approach of evaluating the associated deferred tax asset the Company determined that a valuation allowance was necessary. In addition, in 2003 the Company reduced its deferred tax liability by $3.7 million related to the deductibility of goodwill associated with a 1996 acquisition. In the first quarter of 2002, a portion of the earnings from the Companys U.K. subsidiaries was considered to be indefinitely reinvested and no U.S. taxes were provided on those earnings. The effect of the indefinite reinvestment of the U.K. earnings in 2002 was to lower the annual effective tax rate but this decline was more than offset by prior year foreign tax expense recorded in 2002, primarily $5.9 million for a Norwegian income tax settlement. See Other. These U.K. subsidiaries are now owned, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited. Consequently, earnings and losses from the U.K. subsidiaries for 2003 are part of the earnings and losses of the Cayman Island subsidiary on which no U.S. taxes are provided. Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are its cash flows from operations, proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and other borrowings and its cash reserves. At December 31, 2004, the Company had $266.0 million in Cash and cash equivalents and $661.8 million in Investments and marketable securities, representing the Companys investment of cash available for current operations. Cash Flows from Operations. The Company operates in an industry that has been, and is expected to continue to be, extremely competitive and highly cyclical. The dayrates received by the Companys drilling rigs and rig utilization rates are a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace which is generally correlated with the price of oil and natural gas. As utilization rates increase, dayrates tend to increase as well reflecting the lower supply of available rigs, and vice versa. The same factors, primarily demand for drilling services, which is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development as well as a variety of political and economic factors, and availability of rigs in a particular geographical region, affect both dayrates and utilization rates. These factors are not within the Companys control and are difficult to predict. For a description of other factors that could affect the Companys cash flows from operations, see Overview Results of Operations and Industry Conditions and Forward Looking Statements. Shelf Registration. The Company has the ability to issue an aggregate of approximately $117.5 million in debt, equity and other securities under a shelf registration statement. In addition, the Company may issue, from time to time, up to eight million shares of common stock, shares which are registered under an acquisition shelf registration statement (upon effectiveness of an amendment thereto reflecting the effect of the two for one stock split declared in July 1997), in connection with one or more acquisitions by the Company of securities or assets of other businesses. Liquidity and Capital Requirements The Companys liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of the Companys working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements. Cash required to meet the Companys capital commitments is determined by evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating the Companys ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, including water depth and drilling capability upgrades. It is managements opinion that operating cash flows and the Companys cash reserves will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments; however, the Company will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions. In addition, the Company may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital 30 Table of Contents expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. The Companys ability to effect any such issuance will be dependent on the Companys results of operations, its current financial condition, current market conditions and other factors beyond its control. The Company believes it has the financial resources needed to meet its business requirements in the foreseeable future, including capital expenditures for rig upgrades and continuing rig enhancements, and working capital requirements. Contractual Cash Obligations. The following table sets forth the Companys contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2004. Payments due by Period Less than 1 3 4 5 After 5 Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years Years (In thousands) Long term debt principal $ 1,193,516 $ 484,102 $ $ 460,000 $ 249,414 Long term debt interest 312,580 20,832 39,550 39,550 212,648 Operating leases 2,103 1,316 729 58 Benefits under pension plan 8,593 629 2,201 1,590 4,173 Total obligations $ 1,516,792 $ 506,879 $ 42,480 $ 501,198 $ 466,235 Purchase obligations at December 31, 2004 related to direct rig operations are excluded from the above table as there are no purchase obligations for major rig upgrades or any other significant obligations other than those necessary for the normal course of business that existed at December 31, 2004. Payments of the Companys long term debt, including interest, could be accelerated due to certain rights that holders of the Companys debentures have to put the securities to the Company. See the discussion below. 5.15% Senior Notes. On August 27, 2004, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.15% Senior Notes Due September 1, 2014 (the 5.15% Senior Notes). The 5.15% Senior Notes were issued at an offering price of 99.759% of the principal amount and resulted in net proceeds to the Company of $247.8 million. The 5.15% Senior Notes bear interest at 5.15% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 2005, and mature on September 1, 2014. The 5.15% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. The Company has the right to redeem all or a portion of the 5.15% Senior Notes for cash at any time or from time to time on at least 15 days but not more than 60 days prior written notice, at the redemption price specified in the governing indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. 1.5% Debentures. On April 11, 2001, the Company issued $460.0 million principal amount of 1.5% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2031 (the 1.5% Debentures) which are due April 15, 2031. The 1.5% Debentures are convertible into shares of the Companys common stock at an initial conversion rate of 20.3978 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company has the right to deliver cash in lieu of shares of the Companys common stock. Interest of 1.5% per year on the outstanding principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures is payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year. In addition, under certain circumstances the Company will pay contingent interest to holders of the 1.5% Debentures during any six month period commencing after April 14, 2008. See 1.5% Debentures in Note 7 to the Companys Consolidated Financial 31 Table of Contents Statements in Item 8 of this report. The 1.5% Debentures are unsecured obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their 1.5% Debentures on April 15, 2008, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or shares of the Companys common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. In addition, holders may require the Company to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their 1.5% Debentures upon a change in control (as defined) for a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the 1.5% Debentures at any time on or after April 15, 2008, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Zero Coupon Debentures. The Companys Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures Due 2020 (the Zero Coupon Debentures) issued on June 6, 2000 at a price of $499.60 per $1,000 debenture are due June 6, 2020, which represents a yield to maturity of 3.50% per year. The Company will not pay interest prior to maturity unless it elects to convert the Zero Coupon Debentures to interest bearing debentures upon the occurrence of certain tax events. The Zero Coupon Debentures are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into the Companys common stock at a fixed conversion rate of 8.6075 shares of common stock per Zero Coupon Debenture, subject to adjustments in certain events. In addition, holders may require the Company to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their Zero Coupon Debentures upon a change in control (as defined) for a purchase price equal to the accreted value through the date of repurchase. The Zero Coupon Debentures are senior unsecured obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. The Company has the right to redeem the Zero Coupon Debentures, in whole or in part, on or after June 6, 2005, for a price equal to the issuance price plus accrued original issue discount through the date of redemption. Holders have the right to require the Company to repurchase the Zero Coupon Debentures on June 6, 2005, June 6, 2010 and June 6, 2015 at the accreted value through the date of repurchase. The Company may pay such repurchase price with either cash or shares of the Companys common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate accreted value of the Zero Coupon Debentures was $471.3 million. Because the holders of the debentures have the right to require the Company to repurchase the debentures within one year, the aggregate accreted value of $471.3 million is classified as a current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2004. The net proceeds from the 5.15% Senior Notes issued in August 2004 are available to partially fund a refinancing of these debentures. On June 6, 2005, the aggregate accreted value of the Zero Coupon Debentures outstanding as of the date of this report will be approximately $478 million. The aggregate principal amount at maturity will be $805.0 million assuming no conversions or redemptions occur prior to the maturity date. Letters of Credit. The Company is contingently liable as of December 31, 2004 in the amount of $76.1 million under certain performance, bid, supersedeas and custom bonds and letters of credit. Agreements related to approximately $34.0 million of multi year performance bonds can require cash collateral for the full line at any time for any reason. Holders of agreements related to another $4.6 million currently have the option to require cash collateral due to the lowering of the Companys credit rating on April 27, 2004. As of December 31, 2004 the Company had not been required to make any cash collateral deposits with respect to these agreements. The remaining agreements cannot require cash collateral except in events of default. On the Companys behalf, banks have issued letters of credit securing certain of these bonds. 32 Table of Contents Credit Ratings. The Companys current credit rating is Baa2 for Moodys Investors Services (Moodys) and A for Standard & Poors (S&P). In 2003 Moodys lowered its ratings of the Companys long term debt to Baa1 from A3 and on April 27, 2004 lowered its rating from Baa1 to Baa2 and changed the rating outlook from negative to stable. On July 27, 2004, S&P lowered the Companys debt rating from A to A and rated its outlook as stable. Although the Companys long term ratings continue at investment grade levels, lower ratings could result in higher interest rates on future debt issuances. Capital Expenditures. In January 2005, the Company announced the initiation of a major upgrade of its Victory class semisubmersible, the Ocean Endeavor, for ultra deepwater service. The modernized rig will be designed to operate in up to 10,000 feet of water at an estimated upgrade cost of approximately $250 million of which approximately $110 million is expected to be expended in 2005. The rig will be mobilized to a shipyard in Singapore where work is scheduled to commence in the second quarter of 2005. Delivery of the upgraded rig is expected in approximately two years. The Company has budgeted an additional $115 million of capital expenditures in 2005 associated with its ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, and other corporate requirements. The Company expects to finance its 2005 capital expenditures through the use of existing cash balances or internally generated funds. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company spent approximately $13 million to upgrade one of its high specification semisubmersible units, the Ocean America, with capabilities making it more suitable for developmental drilling. In addition, the Company spent $76.2 million on its continuing rig capital maintenance program (other than rig upgrades) and to meet other corporate capital expenditure requirements in 2004. The Company has completed its two year program to expand the capabilities of its jack up fleet by significantly upgrading six of its 14 jack up rigs at an aggregate cost of approximately $94 million. Three of these upgrades were completed in 2002, two in 2003 and one in early 2004. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had no off balance sheet debt. Historical Cash Flows The following is a discussion of the Companys historical cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in 2003. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Change (In thousands) Net income (loss) $ (7,243 ) $ (48,414 ) $ 41,171 Net changes in operating assets and liabilities 22,385 (9,393 ) 31,778 (Gain) loss on sale of marketable securities (254 ) 6,884 (7,138 ) Depreciation and other non cash items, net 193,394 213,374 (19,980 ) $ 208,282 $ 162,451 $ 45,831 Cash flows from operations in 2004 increased $45.8 million or 28% over cash generated by operating activities in 2003. The increase in cash flow from operations in 2004 is the result of higher utilization and average dayrates earned by the Companys offshore drilling units as a result of an increase in overall demand 33 Table of Contents for offshore contract drilling services, particularly in the second half of the year. These favorable trends were negatively impacted by reactivation costs for previously cold stacked rigs and repair costs of damages caused by Hurricane Ivan in the third quarter of 2004. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Change (In thousands) Purchase of marketable securities $ (4,606,400 ) $ (2,972,051 ) $ (1,634,349 ) Proceeds from sale of marketable securities 4,466,377 3,087,164 1,379,213 Capital expenditures (excluding rig acquisition) (89,229 ) (208,526 ) 119,297 Rig acquisition (63,500 ) 63,500 Purchases of Australian dollar time deposits (45,456 ) (45,456 ) Proceeds from maturities of Australian dollar time deposits 34,120 34,120 Proceeds from sale of assets 6,900 2,270 4,630 Proceeds from settlement of forward contracts 2,492 (2,492 ) $ (233,688 ) $ (152,151 ) $ (81,537 ) The Company used $233.7 million for investing activities in 2004 compared to $152.2 million in 2003. In 2004 the Company used $229.3 million for net purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures compared to a use of $156.9 million in 2003. The increase in cash usage in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to higher cash outflows related to the net sale and maturity of certain of the Companys investments in marketable securities, which more than offset the cash flow effect of reduced capital spending in 2004. In early 2004 the Company completed its two year program to expand the capabilities of its jack up fleet (see Liquidity and Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures) and focused primarily on its ongoing capital maintenance program. During 2003 the Company spent $65.0 million (including $1.5 million of inventory) for the purchase of the semisubmersible rig, the Ocean Patriot, and $208.5 million for capital projects including the Ocean Rover upgrade which was completed in July 2003, and the upgrade of three jack up rigs under the two year upgrade program. In the second quarter of 2004, based on the expectation that higher interest rates could be achieved by investing in Australian dollar based securities, the Company invested $42.1 million (equivalent to 60.0 million Australian dollars) in Australian dollar time deposits with expirations ranging from May 5, 2004 to March 9, 2005, of which $31.2 million (equivalent to 45.0 million Australian dollars) matured during 2004. In 2003, the Company settled its remaining forward exchange contracts, which it entered into in 2002, and received $2.5 million in cash. The Company did not enter into any similar forward exchange contracts in 2004. The Company may utilize forward exchange contracts from time to time to hedge its exposure to changes in exchange rates between U.S. dollars and the local currencies. In February 2005, the Company entered into a forward exchange contract requiring it to purchase the equivalent of approximately $3.0 million in Mexican pesos monthly beginning in March 2005 through May 2005. 34 Table of Contents Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Change (In thousands) Issuance of 5.15% Senior Notes $ 249,397 $ $ 249,397 Debt issuance costs 5.15% Senior Notes (1,751 ) (1,751 ) Payment of dividends (32,281 ) (57,022 ) 24,741 Acquisition of treasury stock (18,077 ) (18,211 ) 134 Ocean Alliance lease leaseback agreement (11,969 ) (11,155 ) (814 ) Proceeds from stock options exercised 168 168 $ 185,487 $ (86,388 ) $ 271,875 On August 27, 2004, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.15% Senior Notes at an offering price of 99.759% of the principal amount, which resulted in net proceeds to the Company of $247.8 million. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements 5.15% Senior Notes. Cash dividends paid to stockholders were $32.3 million in 2004 compared to $57.0 million in 2003. In the second half of 2003, the Company decided to reduce its quarterly cash dividend from $0.125 per share of common stock to $.0625 per share of common stock. Quarterly dividends have continued to be paid at the reduced rate. On January 25, 2005, the Company declared a dividend of $0.0625 per share of the Companys common stock payable March 1, 2005 to stockholders of record on February 1, 2005. Depending on market conditions, the Company may, from time to time, purchase shares of its common stock or issue put options in the open market or otherwise. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company purchased 782,200 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $18.1 million (or $23.11 average cost per share) and 1,014,000 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $18.2 million (or $17.96 average cost per share), respectively. Cash used in financing activities in 2004 and 2003 also included payments of $12.0 million and $11.2 million, respectively, in accordance with the Companys December 2000 lease leaseback agreement for the Ocean Alliance with a European bank. As of December 31, 2004, one installment of $13.7 million remains and is payable in December 2005. This financing agreement has an effective interest rate of 7.13% and is an unsecured obligation of the Company. Other Currency Risk. Certain of the Companys subsidiaries use the local currency in the country where they conduct operations as their functional currency. Currency environments in which the Company has material business operations include Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia. When possible, the Company attempts to minimize its currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to the Companys estimated operating costs payable in local currency with the balance of the contract payable in U.S. dollars. At present, however, only a limited number of the Companys contracts are payable both in U.S. dollars and the local currency. Currency translation adjustments are generally accumulated in a separate section of stockholders equity. If the Company ceases its operations in a currency environment, the accumulated adjustments would be recognized currently in results of operations. The effect on results of operations from these translation gains and losses has not been material and are not expected to have a significant effect in the future. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123). This statement supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. This statement requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be 35 Table of Contents recognized in financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS 123 is effective as of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after that date. The Companys adoption of SFAS 123 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In December 2004 the FASB issued SFAS 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions (SFAS 153). The amendments made by SFAS 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. Further, the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. The statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005 with earlier adoption permitted. The provisions of this statement shall be applied prospectively. The Companys adoption of SFAS 153 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Forward looking statements included in this report speak only as of the date of this report. The Company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement to reflect any change in the Companys expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward looking statement is based. 38 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The information included in this Item 7A is considered to constitute forward looking statements for purposes of the statutory safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements in Item 7 of this report. The Companys measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of its financial instruments. Market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by the Company at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. The Company believes that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since the Companys investment portfolio is subject to change based on its portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur. Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management. Senior management approves the overall investment strategy employed by the Company and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to it. The Company may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions. Interest Rate Risk The Company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. The Companys investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities. The Company monitors its sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of its financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates. The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of the Companys investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity. The analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of the Companys financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which the Company believes are reasonably possible over a one year period. The sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of the Companys interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly, the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the Companys earnings or stockholders equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions the Company could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. The Companys long term debt, as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 is denominated in U.S. dollars. The Companys debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates, and as such, interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of $177.8 million and $150.5 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A 100 basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of $217.3 million and $186.8 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. During 2004 the Company invested in fixed rate Australian dollar 39 Table of Contents time deposits and at December 31, 2004 15.0 million Australian dollars (equivalent to $11.6 million) of time deposits were included in Investments and marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their levels at December 31, 2004. The following table presents the Companys market risk by category (interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates): Fair Value Asset (Liability) Market Risk December 31, December 31, Category of Risk Exposure: 2004 2003 2004 2003 (In thousands) Interest rate: Marketable securities $ 650,247 (a) $ 503,995 (a) $ 2,100 (c) $ 700 (c) Long term debt (1,213,820 )(b) (909,100 )(b) Foreign Exchange: Australian dollar time deposits 11,602 (d) 2,300 (d) (a) The fair market value of the Companys investment in marketable securities is based on the quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. (b) The fair values of the Companys 5.15% Senior Notes, which were issued in August 2004, 1.5% Debentures due 2031 and Zero Coupon Debentures due 2020 are based on the quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. The fair value of the Companys Ocean Alliance lease leaseback agreement is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 4.27% for December 31, 2004 and 2.08% for December 31, 2003. (c) The calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. (d) The calculation of estimated foreign exchange risk is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of a decrease in foreign exchange rates of 20% at December 31, 2004. 40 Table of Contents
