Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements (including the Notes thereto) in Item 8 of this report. We provide contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe and are a leader in deepwater drilling with a fleet of 44 offshore drilling rigs. Our fleet currently consists of 30 semisubmersibles, 13 jack ups and one drillship. In August 2005, we purchased the Ocean Monarch (formerly the Enserch Garden Banks), a Victory class semisubmersible drilling rig and related equipment, for $20 million and removed from service one of our jack up rigs, the Ocean Warwick, as a result of damages it sustained during Hurricane Katrina. See Overview Impact of 2005 Hurricanes. In June 2005, we completed the sale of the Ocean Liberator and received net cash proceeds of $13.6 million. Overview Industry Conditions The steadily rising demand for our mid water (intermediate) and deepwater (high specification) semisubmersible rigs that characterized the first nine months of 2005 continued during the fourth quarter of the year, while the market for our jack up fleet reflected particular strength. Supported by solid fundamental market conditions for all classes of offshore drilling rigs, dayrates have in many cases more than doubled previous cycle peaks, and our customers are increasingly seeking longer term contracts. As a result, we increased our revenue backlog from approximately $900 million, or 31.4 rig years, at the beginning of 2005 to a current backlog of approximately $4.5 billion, or 69.1 rig years, as of early February 2006. Generally rig utilization rates approach 95 98% during contracted periods; however, utilization rates can be adversely impacted by additional downtime due to various operating factors including, but not limited to, unscheduled repairs, maintenance and weather. Gulf of Mexico. In the GOM, dayrates continue to escalate. A contract for one of our high specification rigs has reached as high as $395,000 per day for work beginning in the first quarter of 2007 and extending until the first quarter of 2008. This contrasts with a dayrate of $150,000 that the unit is currently earning. Six of our seven high specification semisubmersible rigs in the GOM, including the recently relocated Ocean Baroness, have future contracts or a letter of intent, or LOI, at dayrates at least 100 percent higher than the average dayrate these rigs earned during the first quarter of 2005. An LOI is subject to customary conditions, including the execution of a definitive agreement, and actual revenues received could be reduced by various operating factors, including utilization rates. The dayrates for our five intermediate semisubmersibles currently operating in the GOM have reached as high as $200,000 for a one well contract beginning in the third quarter of 2006. This contrasts with an average dayrate in the low $60,000 range earned during the first quarter of 2005 by our intermediate drilling units in the GOM. We continue to view the deepwater and intermediate markets in the GOM as under supplied and believe that additional improvements in backlog and dayrates are possible in these market segments during 2006. Our jack up fleet in the GOM also continued to experience high utilization and improving dayrates during the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to the first nine months of 2005. Dayrates for our jack up fleet operating in the GOM have reached as high as $125,000 for a two well contract beginning late in the first quarter of 2006. This contrasts with an average dayrate in the low $40,000 range earned by our jack up rigs in the GOM during the first quarter of 2005. Industry wide, we believe that nine jack up units were lost due to hurricanes in 2004 and 2005, and we expect up to six additional jack up units to leave the GOM for other international markets by mid 2006. Among the six jack up rigs that are expected to leave the GOM is the Ocean Spur. We expect to mobilize the rig from the GOM to Tunisia in the first quarter of 2006, where the unit has a commitment at a dayrate of $125,000 for a period of 12 months beginning in mid March. We view the jack up market in the GOM as under supplied and believe that additional improvement in backlog and dayrates is possible in this market segment during 2006. In the Mexican sector of the Gulf of Mexico, or Mexican GOM, our four intermediate semisubmersible rigs remain under long term contracts that extend into late 2006 and 2007. We view the market for the Mexican GOM as firm and expect it to remain so during 2006. 18 Table of Contents Brazil. Two of our rigs operating in Brazil are currently working under term contracts that expire in 2009 and two additional rigs are operating under contracts expiring in 2010. We do not currently contemplate any change in our market position in Brazil. We view the Brazilian semisubmersible market as firm and expect it to remain so during 2006. North Sea. Drilling activity in both the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea has mirrored that in the GOM since mid 2004. Our three intermediate semisubmersible rigs in the U.K. sector are operating under one to two year term contracts at dayrates ranging from $100,000 to $160,000 for work that is now underway. Additionally, one of these three rigs, the Ocean Nomad, has received an 18 month contract extension beginning in the first quarter of 2007 at a dayrate of $285,000. In Norway, the Ocean Vanguard is working under a $140,000 per day contract that expires early in the fourth quarter of 2006, followed by options priced at $160,000 per day that expire in the first quarter of 2008. Effective industry utilization remains near 100 percent in the North Sea, and current dayrates exceed our present and future contract rates in both the U.K. and Norwegian sectors. We believe this market will continue to improve during 2006. Australia/Asia/Middle East/Mediterranean. We currently have five semisubmersible rigs and one jack up rig operating in the Australia/Asia, or Australasian, market. These rigs are operating under contracts or commitments for work extending well into 2006, and in some instances 2007 or 2008, at increasing dayrates, compared to dayrates averaging in the low $100,000 range at the end of 2005. A commitment for one of our intermediate rigs in the sector has reached as high as $235,000 per day for one well beginning in the second quarter of 2006. This contrasts with a dayrate of $90,000 that the unit is currently earning. With the relocation of the Ocean Heritage from Southeast Asia to Qatar in the second quarter of 2005 and the expected mobilization of the Ocean Spur to the Mediterranean in the first quarter of 2006, we are continuing to strategically redeploy our fleet in response to rising market demand and dayrates. We believe that the Australasian and Middle East/Mediterranean markets will continue to improve during 2006. Impact of 2005 Hurricanes In the third quarter of 2005, two major hurricanes, Katrina and Rita, struck the U.S. Gulf Coast and GOM. In late August 2005, one of our jack up drilling rigs, the Ocean Warwick, was seriously damaged during Hurricane Katrina and other rigs in our fleet sustained lesser damage in Hurricanes Katrina or Rita, or in some cases from both storms. We believe that the physical damage to our rigs, as well as related removal and recovery costs, are covered by insurance, after applicable deductibles. Our results for 2005 reflect the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Ocean Warwick, with a net book value of $14.0 million, was declared a constructive total loss effective August 29, 2005. We issued a proof of loss in the amount of $50.5 million to our insurers, representing the insured value of the rig less a $4.5 million deductible, and received all insurance proceeds related to this insurance claim in 2005. Recovery and removal of the Ocean Warwick are subject to separate insurance deductibles totaling $2.5 million. In the third quarter of 2005, we recorded a $33.6 million, pre tax, net casualty gain ($21.8 million, after tax, or $0.15 per share of common stock on a diluted basis) on the Ocean Warwick, representing net insurance proceeds of $50.5 million, less the write off of the $14.0 million net carrying value of the drilling rig and $0.4 million in rig based inventory, and $2.5 million in insurance deductibles for salvage and wreck removal as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We have presented this as Casualty Gain on Ocean Warwick in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in Item 8 of this report. Damage to our other affected rigs and warehouse in New Iberia, Louisiana was less severe, and we believe that repair costs for such damage and lost equipment will be covered by insurance, less estimated deductibles. All of our damaged rigs have now been repaired and returned to service. Insurance deductibles relating to the remaining rigs damaged during Hurricane Katrina and our rigs and facility damaged by Hurricane Rita total $2.6 million in the aggregate, of which $1.2 million and $1.4 million have been recorded as additional contract drilling expense and loss on disposition of assets, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005 in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in Item 8 of this report. In addition, in the third quarter of 2005, we wrote off the net book value of approximately $4.2 million, pre tax, in rig equipment that was either lost or damaged beyond repair during these storms as loss on disposition of assets 19 Table of Contents and recorded a corresponding insurance receivable in an amount equal to our expected recovery from insurers. The write off of this equipment and recognition of insurance receivables had no net effect on our consolidated results of operations in 2005. During the third and fourth quarters of 2005, we incurred additional operating expenses, including but not limited to the cost of rig crew over time and employee assistance, hurricane relief supplies, temporary housing and office space and the rental of mooring equipment, of $5.1 million, pre tax, relating to relief and recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which we do not expect to be recoverable through our insurance. General Revenues. Our revenues vary based upon demand, which affects the number of days our drilling fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned by our rigs. When a rig is idle, no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result. Revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs, required surveys and shipyard upgrades. In order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates, we may mobilize our rigs from one market to another. However, during periods of mobilization, revenues may be adversely affected. As a response to changes in demand, we may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously, which may decrease or increase revenues, respectively. The two most significant variables affecting our revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates, each of which is ultimately a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace. As utilization rates increase, dayrates tend to increase as well, reflecting the lower supply of available rigs, and vice versa. Demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development, as well as a variety of political and economic factors. The availability of rigs in a particular geographical region also affects both dayrates and utilization rates. These factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict. We recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed. In connection with such drilling contracts, we may receive lump sum fees for the mobilization of equipment. We earn these fees as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. We previously accounted for the excess of mobilization fees received over costs incurred to mobilize an offshore rig from one market to another as revenue over the term of the related drilling contracts. Effective July 1, 2004 we changed our accounting to defer mobilization fees received as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred and began to amortize each, on a straight line basis, over the term of the related drilling contracts (which is the period estimated to be benefited from the mobilization activity). We believe that the straight line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts (which generally range from two to 60 months) is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed. If we had used this method of accounting in prior periods, our operating income (loss) and net income (loss) would not have changed and the impact on our contract drilling revenues and expenses would have been immaterial. Absent a contract, mobilization costs are recognized currently. From time to time, we may receive fees from our customers for capital improvements to our rigs. We defer such fees received in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report and recognize these fees into income on a straight line basis over the period of the related drilling contract. We capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of the improvement. We receive reimbursements for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services and other services provided at the request of our customers in accordance with a contract or agreement. We record these reimbursements at the gross amount billed to the customer, as Revenues related to reimbursable expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in Item 8 of this report. Operating Income. Our operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors, but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses. Operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and may not be significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or ready stacked state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract. However, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, we may reduce the size of a rigs crew and 20 Table of Contents take steps to cold stack the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income. We recognize, as incurred, operating expenses related to activities such as inspections, painting projects and routine overhauls that meet certain criteria and which maintain rather than upgrade our rigs. These expenses vary from period to period. Costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements. Higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades. Our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections, which we refer to as a 5 year survey or special survey, that are due every five years for each of our rigs. Operating revenue decreases because these surveys are performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard. Operating expenses increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs. Repair and maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of rigs undergoing a 5 year survey will vary from year to year. In addition, operating income may be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim periods between 5 year surveys. Intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a 5 year survey and require downtime for the drilling rig, but normally do not require dry docking or shipyard time. During 2006, we expect to spend an aggregate of $7.4 million for 5 year and intermediate surveys, excluding mobilization costs and any resulting repair and maintenance costs. Critical Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Judgments, assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies. We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows: Property, Plant and Equipment. We carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost. Maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments, which meet certain criteria, are capitalized. Depreciation is amortized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives. Our management makes judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization, useful lives and salvage values. Changes in these judgments, assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported. The offshore drilling industry is a relatively young industry which began developing just over 50 years ago. We have based our estimates of useful lives and salvage values on the historical industry data available to us, as well as our own experience. In April 2003, we commissioned a study to evaluate the economic lives of our drilling rigs because several of our rigs had reached or were approaching the end of their depreciable lives, yet were still operating and were expected to operate for many more years. As a result of this study, effective April 1, 2003, we recorded changes in accounting estimates by increasing the estimated service lives to 25 years for our jack ups and 30 years for our semisubmersibles and drillship and by increasing salvage values to 5% for most of our drilling rigs. We made the change in estimates to better reflect the remaining economic lives and salvage values of our fleet. The effect of this change in accounting estimates resulted in an increase in our net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 of $15.7 million, or $0.11 per share, and a reduction of our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 of, $19.6 million, or $0.15 per share, and $14.9 million, or $0.11 per share, respectively. We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We utilize a probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. Our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following: dayrate by rig; utilization rate by rig (expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used); the per day operating cost for each rig if active, ready stacked or cold stacked; and salvage value for each rig. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we develop a matrix by assigning probabilities to various combinations of assumed utilization rates and dayrates. We also consider the impact of a 5% reduction in assumed dayrates for 21 Table of Contents the cold stacked rigs (holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant), or alternatively the impact of a 5% reduction in utilization (again holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant) as part of our analysis. At December 31, 2005, we reviewed our single cold stacked rig, the Ocean Monarch, for impairment. Based on our recent decision to upgrade this drilling unit to high specification capabilities at an estimated cost of approximately $300 million and the low net book value of this rig, we do not consider this asset to be impaired. In December 2004, we reviewed our three cold stacked rigs for impairment and determined that none of the drilling units was impaired. On January 10, 2005, we announced that we would upgrade one of our cold stacked rigs, the Ocean Endeavor, to a high specification drilling unit for an estimated cost of approximately $250 million. As a result of this decision and the low net book value of this rig, we did not consider this asset to be impaired. We were marketing another of our cold stacked rigs, the Ocean Liberator, for sale to a third party in 2004, and we classified the rig as an asset held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2004 included in Item 8 of this report. The estimated market value of this rig, based on offers from third parties, was higher than its current carrying value; therefore, no write down was deemed necessary as a result of the reclassification to an asset held for sale. We sold the Ocean Liberator in the second quarter of 2005 for a net gain of $8.0 million. We evaluated our then remaining cold stacked rig for impairment using the probability weighted cash flow analysis discussed above. At December 31, 2004, the probability weighted cash flow for the Ocean New Era significantly exceeded its net carrying value of $3.2 million. We reactivated the Ocean New Era from cold stacked status in the fourth quarter of 2005 and it began operating under contract in the GOM in December 2005. At December 31, 2003 we determined that all five of our cold stacked rigs should be tested for impairment. The impairment analysis at December 31, 2003 consisted of a probability weighted cash flow analysis for each of the five cold stacked rigs. In all cases, the probability weighted cash flows significantly exceeded the carrying value of each rig. Managements assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. Personal Injury Claims. Our uninsured retention of liability for personal injury claims, which primarily results from Jones Act liability in the GOM, is $0.5 million per claim with an additional aggregate annual deductible of $1.5 million. Our in house claims department estimates the amount of our liability for our retention. This department establishes a reserve for each of our personal injury claims by evaluating the existing facts and circumstances of each claim and comparing the circumstances of each claim to our historical experiences with similar past personal injury claims. Our claims department also estimates our liability for claims which are incurred but not reported by using historical data. Historically, our ultimate liability for personal injury claims has not differed materially from our recorded estimates. At December 31, 2005 our estimated liability for personal injury claims was $38.9 million. The eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from the estimated amounts due to uncertainties such as: the severity of personal injuries claimed; significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims; the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated; inconsistent court decisions; and the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced 22 Table of Contents by a valuation allowance, if necessary, which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach. For interim periods, we estimate our annual effective tax rate by forecasting our annual income before income tax, taxable income and tax expense in each of our tax jurisdictions. We make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to forecasting of our effective tax rate, the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits, and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit. At the end of 2004 we had established a valuation allowance of $10.3 million for certain of our foreign tax credit carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2011. At December 31, 2005, we had $15.3 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards. During 2005, we were able to utilize most of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income generated during the year. As a result, we now expect to be able to utilize $14.5 million of our available foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration dates and we believe that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary for those credits. Consequently, we reversed $9.6 million of the previously established valuation allowance during 2005. With respect to the remaining $0.8 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards, we believe that a valuation allowance is necessary and as a result have a valuation allowance of $0.8 million at December 31, 2005. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Comparative data relating to our revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are presented below. We have reclassified certain amounts applicable to the prior periods to conform to the classifications we currently follow. These reclassifications do not affect earnings.

Revenues for our high specification rigs in the GOM increased $160.6 million, primarily due to higher average dayrates earned ($128.0 million) and higher utilization of our fleet in this market ($31.9 million) in 2005, as compared to 2004. The higher overall dayrates achieved for our high specification floaters reflected the continuing high demand for this class of rig in the GOM. Average dayrates for these rigs increased to $143,800 in 2005 compared to $82,000 in 2004. Fleet utilization for our high specification rigs in the GOM increased to 91% in 2005 from 80% in 2004. Higher utilization in 2005 compared to the prior year reflects the return to drilling operations of several rigs which did not operate in 2004 due to scheduled inspections and repairs (Ocean Confidence and Ocean America) and upgrade projects (Ocean America) and the ready stacking of the Ocean Star for the first five months of 2004. In the late third quarter of 2005, we relocated the Ocean Baroness from the Australia/Asia market to the GOM for a long term contract extending until November 2009. The Ocean Baroness began operating under contract in the GOM in November 2005 and generated revenues of $9.8 million in 2005, which are included in the utilization factors discussed above. Operating costs during 2005 for our high specification floaters in the GOM increased $7.0 million over operating costs in 2004. The increase in operating costs is primarily attributable to higher labor and benefits costs related to higher utilization of our rigs and the effect of December 2004 and September 2005 wage increases. Costs in 2005 also include operating expenses for the Ocean Baroness in the GOM, including mobilization costs from Southeast Asia. Increased operating costs in 2005 were partly offset by our recovery from a customer for damages sustained to one of our high specification rigs during Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Australia/Asia. Revenues generated by our rigs in the Australia/Asia region decreased $12.3 million to $68.3 million in 2005, as compared to revenues of $80.7 million in 2004. Utilization in this region decreased from 95% in 2004 to 80% in 2005, primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean Baroness from this market to the GOM. Prior to its departure to the GOM, the Ocean Baroness was mobilized to a shipyard in Singapore in mid May 2005 for an intermediate inspection and preparation for the rigs dry tow to the GOM, which resulted in additional unpaid downtime for the drilling unit as compared to 2004. The decline in utilization in 2005, as compared to 2004, resulted in a $23.9 million reduction in revenues in 2005. Average operating dayrates in this region increased from $116,600 in 2004 to $141,000 in 2005 and resulted in additional revenues of $11.6 million in 2005 compared to 2004. Contract drilling expenses in the region decreased $4.8 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean Baroness to the GOM in the third quarter of 2005. The overall decline in operating costs in the region was partly offset by higher insurance costs associated with increased premiums for the 2005/2006 policy year and additional loss of hire insurance coverage. 25 Table of Contents South America. Revenues for our high specification rig operations offshore Brazil increased $18.8 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily as a result of increased utilization for the Ocean Alliance in 2005 as compared to the prior year, when this rig experienced approximately five months of unpaid downtime. Utilization for these rigs offshore Brazil increased from 76% in 2004 to 89% in 2005 and contributed $9.5 million in additional revenues. Additionally, we negotiated a contract extension, including a dayrate increase, for the Ocean Alliance in the third quarter of 2005. Average dayrates earned by our high specification rigs in this region increased to $117,300 in 2005 from $102,900 in 2004, which contributed $9.3 million in additional revenues during 2005. Contract drilling expense for these operations in Brazil increased $4.9 million in 2005, as compared to the prior year. The increase in costs in 2005 is primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs as a result of December 2004 and September 2005 pay increases, increased local shorebase support costs due to the completion of a local training program in Brazil and higher insurance costs associated with increased premiums for the 2005/2006 policy year and additional loss of hire insurance.

Revenues generated in 2005 by our intermediate semisubmersible fleet operating in the GOM increased $57.1 million due to higher average dayrates earned ($31.3 million) and higher utilization of our fleet in this market ($27.5 million), as compared to 2004. Average dayrates earned increased to $77,300 in 2005 compared to $44,600 in 2004, reflecting the tightening market for intermediate semisubmersibles in the GOM. During 2004, we recognized $1.8 million in lump sum mobilization fees for the Ocean Concord. Overall utilization for our intermediate semisubmersibles in this region (excluding the Ocean Endeavor, which was cold stacked during 2004 prior to commencing a major upgrade in 2005, and the cold stacked Ocean Monarch, which we acquired in August 2005) increased to 71% in 2005 from 50% in 2004. The increase in utilization in 2005, as compared to 2004, is primarily due to the nearly full utilization of the Ocean Voyager in 2005 compared to 2004, when this unit was cold stacked for most of the year, and increased utilization for the Ocean Concord, which was out of service for almost six months in 2004 for a 5 year survey and maintenance projects. Additionally, we reactivated the Ocean New Era from cold stack status in the last half of 2005, and this drilling unit returned to active service in late December 2005. Partially offsetting the overall increase in utilization in 2005, as compared to 2004, was approximately four months of unpaid downtime for the Ocean Lexington in 2005 associated with inspections and a steel renewal project. 26 Table of Contents Contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersibles operations in the GOM increased $12.6 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to higher labor and benefits costs as a result of December 2004 and September 2005 wage increases for our rig based personnel, normal operating costs for the Ocean Voyager and Ocean New Era in 2005 and higher inspection and maintenance project costs for the Ocean Lexington, which was in a shipyard for inspections and a steel renewal project during 2005. These cost increases were partly offset by lower reactivation costs for the Ocean New Era in 2005, as compared to costs incurred to reactivate the Ocean Voyager in 2004. Australia/Asia. Our intermediate semisubmersibles working offshore Australia/Asia generated revenues of $111.8 million in 2005 compared to revenues of $77.2 million in 2004. The $34.6 million increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in average operating dayrates to $76,300 in 2005 compared to $62,900 in 2004, which generated $16.9 million in additional revenues in 2005. Our results in this region in 2005 also reflect the favorable impact of the Ocean Patriot operating for the majority of the year following its relocation to the region in the second half of 2004. However, excluding the Ocean Patriot, our average utilization for these rigs in the Australia/Asia region decreased from 96% in 2004 to 92% in 2005, primarily due to unpaid downtime for the Ocean Epoch which was in a shipyard for approximately 70 days in 2005 for a scheduled 5 year survey and associated repairs. The net effect of changes in utilization in this region was the generation of $10.7 million in additional revenues in 2005 compared to 2004. During 2005 we recognized $5.7 million in lump sum mobilization fees for the Ocean Patriot related to its 2004 mobilization from South Africa to New Zealand and the Bass Strait, compared to $3.3 million in similar fees recognized in 2004. In 2005 we also recognized $3.7 million in revenue related to the extension of a contract option period for one of our rigs in this region and $0.9 million in revenues for the amortization of lump sum fees received from a customer for rig modifications. Contract drilling expense for the Australia/Asia region increased $19.8 million from 2004 to 2005, primarily due to costs associated with the Ocean Patriot operating offshore Australia for all of 2005, including the amortization of deferred mobilization expenses. Europe/Africa. Operating revenues for our intermediate semisubmersibles working in this region increased $37.0 million in 2005 primarily due to an increase in the average operating dayrates from $54,400 in 2004 to $87,500 in 2005. This increase in average operating dayrates contributed $40.6 million in additional revenues in 2005, as compared to 2004. With the exception of the Ocean Patriot, which relocated from this region to Australia in mid 2004, average utilization increased slightly in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to higher utilization of the Ocean Nomad in 2005 as compared to 2004, when this drilling unit was both ready stacked and mobilizing between Africa and the U.K. for a total of approximately 5 months during the year. The net effect of changes in average utilization between 2005 and 2004 was a $1.9 million decrease in operating revenues in 2005. In 2004, we also recognized $2.0 million in mobilization revenue for the Ocean Nomad. Contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating offshore Europe increased $10.4 million in 2005 primarily due to increased labor and related costs and shorebase support costs for our operations in Norway, mostly due to Norwegian pay allowances and additional personnel required to comply with Norwegian regulations. Normal operating expenses for the Ocean Nomad increased in 2005, as compared to 2004, mainly due to higher labor costs associated with its operations in the U.K., as compared to the prior year when this unit worked a portion of the year offshore western Africa, as well as the recognition of mobilization expenses in 2005 related to the rigs relocation from western Africa to the U.K. Our operating costs in this region in 2004 included $8.7 million in costs for the Ocean Patriot which relocated to the Australia/Asia region in mid 2004. South America. Our intermediate semisubmersibles working in Brazil generated revenues of $53.6 million in 2005 compared to revenues of $44.8 million in 2004. The $8.8 million increase in operating revenues was primarily due to a contract extension for the Ocean Yatzy at a higher average dayrate than it previously earned. Average operating dayrates increased to $75,100, as compared to an average dayrate of $70,300 in 2004, and resulted in additional revenues of $4.3 million in 2005. Average utilization of our rigs in this region increased from 87% in 27 Table of Contents 2004 to 98% in 2005, which resulted in additional revenues in 2005 of $4.5 million. The lower utilization in 2004 was primarily due to additional downtime for special surveys and inspections of both of our rigs in this region. Operating expenses for the Ocean Yatzy and Ocean Winner increased $4.7 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to increased labor costs for our rig based personnel as a result of December 2004 and September 2005 wage increases and higher national labor and local shorebase support costs resulting from completion of a local competency program in Brazil.

Our operating results in this region reflect the continued improvement in average operating dayrates and utilization for jack up rigs in the GOM during 2005. Average operating dayrates increased to $54,600 in 2005 from $36,300 in 2004, which resulted in additional revenues of $75.5 million in 2005. Utilization of our jack up fleet in the GOM continued to improve in 2005 compared to the average utilization achieved by our rigs in 2004. Average utilization in 2005 increased to 96% from 87% in 2004, resulting in additional revenues of $8.0 million in 2005. The improvement in utilization is primarily due to the nearly full utilization of the Ocean Champion in 2005 as compared to 2004, when it completed its reactivation from cold stacked status, and the full utilization of the Ocean Nugget in 2005, as compared to 60 days of unpaid downtime in 2004 for a spud can inspection and related repair work. In late August 2005, the Ocean Warwick was declared a constructive total loss by our insurers as a result of damage it sustained during Hurricane Katrina. During 2005 and 2004, this drilling rig generated $11.8 million and $9.3 million in revenues, respectively, which are included in the revenue variances discussed above. See Overview Impact of 2005 Hurricanes. Contract drilling expenses for our jack ups operating in the GOM increased $9.0 million in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to higher labor and benefits costs for our rig based personnel as a result of December 2004 and September 2005 wage increases, higher normal operating costs in 2005 for the Ocean Champion compared to 2004 when the rig was being reactivated and higher operating and overhead costs for most of our jack ups in this region due to increased utilization. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Revenues for jack ups in the Australasian and Middle East regions were $49.4 million in 2005 compared to $21.3 million in 2004. The $28.2 million increase in revenues in this region in 2005 is primarily attributable to revenues generated by the Ocean Heritage ($17.0 million), which worked in this region for the entire year, compared to working in this region during only the last quarter of 2004, and an operating dayrate increase for the Ocean Sovereign ($11.2 million) after its second quarter 2005 relocation within the region to Indonesia. 28 Table of Contents Contract drilling expense for jack ups in the Australasian and Middle East regions increased $9.4 million to $25.0 million in 2005, as compared 2004, primarily due to normal operating costs associated with the Ocean Heritage operating in the region for the entire year, and higher normal repair and maintenance, travel and shore based costs for the Ocean Sovereign. South America. The Ocean Heritage operated offshore Ecuador for almost eight months in 2004. During its contract the rig generated $18.2 million in revenues, including the recognition of $8.5 million in lump sum mobilization fees, and incurred operating expenses of $9.0 million before returning to the Australasia/Middle East region in the fourth quarter of 2004. Other Operating Revenue and Expenses, net. Other operating expenses, net of other revenues, were $8.3 million in 2005 compared to $1.2 million in 2004. The $7.2 million increase in net costs in 2005, as compared to 2004, relates primarily to costs associated with relief and recovery efforts in the aftermath of the 2005 GOM hurricanes, increased rig crew training costs due to higher staffing and recruiting levels in 2005 and higher costs in 2005 to repair and replace non rig specific spare equipment. Reimbursable expenses, net. Revenues related to reimbursable items, offset by the related expenditures for these items, were $6.4 million and $3.4 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Reimbursable expenses include items that we purchase, and or services we perform, at the request of our customers. We charge our customers for purchases and or services performed on their behalf at cost, plus a mark up where applicable. Therefore, net reimbursables fluctuate based on customer requirements, which vary. Depreciation. Depreciation expense increased $4.9 million to $183.7 million in 2005 compared to $178.8 million in 2004 primarily due to depreciation recorded in 2005 associated with capital additions in 2004 and 2005. The increase in depreciation expense attributable to capital additions was partially offset by lower depreciation due to the constructive total loss of the Ocean Warwick in the third quarter of 2005 and the transfer of the Ocean Liberator to assets held for sale in December 2004. General and Administrative Expense. We incurred general and administrative expense of $37.2 million in 2005 compared to $32.8 million in 2004. The $4.4 million increase in overhead costs between the periods was primarily due to higher compensation expense related to our management bonus plan, higher fees paid to our external auditors and higher engineering consulting fees. Partially offsetting these higher expenses were lower legal fees in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to the settlement of litigation in December 2004, and the capitalization of certain costs associated with the upgrade of the Ocean Endeavor, which commenced in 2005. Gain on Sale and Disposition of Assets. We recognized a net gain of $14.8 million on the sale and disposition of assets in 2005 compared to a net loss of $1.6 million in 2004. Net gains recognized in 2005 include an $8.0 million gain on the June 2005 sale of the Ocean Liberator, $5.6 million in insurance proceeds related to the involuntary conversion of certain assets damaged during Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and gains on the sale of used drill pipe during the period. Partially offsetting the net gain in 2005 was a $1.4 million loss due to the retirement of equipment lost or damaged during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The loss on sale of assets in 2004 relates primarily to the retirement of equipment damaged during Hurricane Ivan. Casualty Gain on Ocean Warwick. We recorded a $33.6 million casualty gain in 2005 as a result of the constructive total loss of one of our jack up rigs, the Ocean Warwick, resulting from damages sustained during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. See Overview Impact of 2005 Hurricanes. 29 Table of Contents Interest Income. We earned interest income of $26.0 million in 2005 compared to $12.2 million in 2004. The $13.8 million increase in interest income is primarily the result of the combined effect of slightly higher interest rates earned on higher average cash and investment balances in 2005, as compared to 2004. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements and Historical Cash Flows. Interest Expense. Interest expense for 2005 was $41.8 million, or an $11.5 million increase in interest cost compared to 2004. This increase was primarily attributable to interest related to our 4.875% Senior Notes Due July 1, 2015, or 4.875% Senior Notes, and our 5.15% Senior Notes Due September 1, 2014, or 5.15% Senior Notes, which we issued in June 2005 and August 2004, respectively. In addition, interest expense for 2005 included a write off of $6.9 million in debt issuance costs associated with our June 2005 repurchase of approximately 96% of our then outstanding Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures due 2020, or Zero Coupon Debentures. This increase in interest cost was partially offset by lower interest expense on our Zero Coupon Debentures as a result of our partial repurchase of the outstanding debentures in June 2005 and approximately $0.7 million in interest costs which were capitalized in 2005 related to qualifying upgrade and construction projects. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements Contractual Cash Obligations. Other Income and Expense (Other, net). Included in Other, net are foreign currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses and other income and expense items, among other things, which are not attributable to our drilling operations. The components of Other, net fluctuate based on the level of activity, as well as fluctuations in foreign currencies. We recorded other expense, net, of $1.1 million in both 2005 and 2004. Effective October 1, 2005, we changed the functional currency of certain of our subsidiaries operating outside the United States to the U.S. dollar to more appropriately reflect the primary economic environment in which these subsidiaries operate. Prior to this date, these subsidiaries utilized the local currency of the country in which they conduct business as their functional currency. During 2005 and 2004, we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of $0.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively, including $3.5 million in additional expense in 2005 as a result of our change in functional currency to the U.S. dollar. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, we accounted for foreign currency translation gains and losses as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive losses in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report. Income Tax Expense. Our net income tax expense is a function of the mix of our domestic and international pre tax earnings, as well as the mix of earnings from the international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognized $96.1 million of tax expense on pre tax income of $356.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to tax expense of $3.7 million on a pre tax loss of $3.5 million in 2004. Certain of our rigs that operate internationally are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited, a Cayman Island subsidiary that we wholly own. We do not intend to remit earnings from this subsidiary to the U.S. and we plan to indefinitely reinvest these earnings internationally. Consequently, we provided no U.S. taxes on earnings and recognized no U.S. benefits on losses generated by this subsidiary during 2005 and 2004. At the end of 2004 we had established a valuation allowance of $10.3 million for certain of our foreign tax credit carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2011. At December 31, 2005, we had $15.3 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards. During 2005, we were able to utilize most of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income generated during the year. As a result, we now expect to be able to utilize $14.5 million of our available foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration dates, and we believe that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary for those credits. Consequently, we reversed $9.6 million of the previously established valuation allowance during 2005. With respect to the remaining $0.8 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards, we 30 Table of Contents believe that a valuation allowance is necessary and as a result have a valuation allowance of $0.8 million at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2004 we had a reserve of $8.9 million ($1.7 million included with Current Taxes Payable and $7.2 in Other Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets) for the exposure related to the disallowance of goodwill deductibility associated with a 1996 acquisition. During 2005 we concluded that the reserve was no longer necessary and eliminated the reserve, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $8.9 million. During 2005, we settled an income tax dispute in East Timor (formerly part of Indonesia) for approximately $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, our books reflected an accrued liability of $4.4 million related to potential East Timor and Indonesian income tax liabilities covering the period 1992 through 2000. Subsequent to the tax settlement, we determined that the accrual was no longer necessary and wrote off the accrued liability in the fourth quarter of 2005. During 2004 and 2005, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, examined our federal income tax returns for tax years 2000 and 2002. The examination was concluded during the fourth quarter of 2005. We and the IRS agreed to a limited number of adjustments for which we recorded additional income tax of $1.9 million in 2005. Our tax expense in 2004 included $2.5 million associated with a revision to estimates in tax balance sheet accounts, a tax benefit of $5.2 million related to goodwill arising from a 1996 merger, and a tax benefit of $4.5 million due to the reversal of a tax liability associated with the Ocean Alliance Lease Leaseback. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act, or AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA includes a provision allowing a deduction of 85% for certain foreign earnings that are repatriated. The AJCA provides us the potential opportunity to elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in 2005. Based on the existing language in the AJCA, subsequent guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, and after considering our history of foreign earnings, we did not have undistributed foreign earnings that would qualify for the 85% deduction upon repatriation. Consequently, we did not repatriate any undistributed earnings in 2005 pursuant to the AJCA. 31 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 Comparative data relating to our revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are presented below. We have reclassified certain amounts applicable to the prior periods to conform to the classifications we currently follow. These reclassifications do not affect earnings.

Revenues for our high specification floaters in the GOM decreased $20.2 million, primarily due to lower utilization of our fleet in this market ($7.2 million) and lower average dayrates earned ($13.0 million) in 2004, as compared to 2003. Utilization of this fleet in the GOM fell to 80% in 2004 compared to 84% in 2003, primarily due to rig downtime in 2004 for scheduled inspections and repairs (Ocean Confidence and Ocean America) and upgrade projects (Ocean America) and the ready stacking of the Ocean Star for the first five months of 2004. This decline in utilization was partially offset by increased utilization for the Ocean Valiant, which worked all of 2004 as compared to 2003, when the rig was in a shipyard for approximately three months for a 5 year survey and scheduled maintenance. The lower overall dayrates achieved for our high specification floaters in the GOM reflected the soft market conditions in the GOM during the first half of 2004 as several of these high specification rigs accepted jobs in the mid water depth market at lower dayrates. Average dayrates earned by high specification floaters in the GOM fell to $82,000 in 2004 compared to $89,500 in 2003. Operating costs for our high specification floaters in the GOM during 2004 were slightly lower than our operating costs in 2003. Lower operating expenses for the Ocean Valiant were partially offset by additional costs to repair damages sustained by the Ocean America and Ocean Star during Hurricane Ivan in the latter half of 2004. Operating costs for the Ocean Valiant were higher during 2003, as compared to 2004, as a result of a 5 year survey and related repairs in 2003. Australia/Asia. Revenues for the Ocean Baroness and Ocean Rover increased $28.4 million in 2004 to $80.7 million, as compared to revenues of $52.3 million earned by these rigs in 2003. This increase in revenue is primarily the result of $22.7 million in additional revenue generated by the Ocean Rover in 2004 as it continued its drilling program offshore Malaysia. The Ocean Rover began drilling operations in July 2003 after completion of its upgrade to high specification capabilities, which began in 2002. An increase in average dayrate and utilization for the Ocean Baroness in 2004, as compared to 2003, resulted in $3.9 million and $1.8 million in additional revenues, respectively. Contract drilling expense for these rigs increased $11.0 million in the Australia/Asia region in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to additional, normal operating costs for the Ocean Rover offshore Malaysia, which worked all of 2004, compared to 2003 when most of this rigs costs were capitalized in connection with its upgrade South America. Revenues from our Brazilian operations decreased $17.1 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily as a result of lower utilization of the Ocean Alliance in 2004 due to a series of sub sea and electrical 33 Table of Contents problems, as well as a scheduled 5 year survey and sub sea equipment upgrade that resulted in approximately five months of downtime for the rig. Contract drilling expense for our Brazilian operations increased $7.7 million in 2004, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to repair costs for the Ocean Alliance resulting from a series of sub sea and electrical problems and costs associated with its scheduled 5 year survey in 2004.

Overall utilization for our intermediate semisubmersibles in the GOM (excluding the Ocean Endeavor, which was cold stacked during 2004) decreased from 54% in 2003 to 50% in 2004, primarily as a result of the relocation of the Ocean Ambassador and the Ocean Worker from the GOM to the Mexican GOM in the latter half of 2003 and a 5 year survey and maintenance projects that kept the Ocean Concord out of service for approximately six months in 2004. The overall decline in utilization in the GOM resulted in a $13.1 million decrease in revenues in 2004, as compared to 2003. Average operating dayrates for our intermediate semisubmersibles increased in the GOM from $40,800 in 2003 to $44,600 in 2004 and resulted in the generation of $4.6 million in additional revenues in 2004 compared to the prior year. We also recognized $1.8 million in lump sum mobilization fees for the Ocean Concord in 2004. Contract drilling expense for these operations in the GOM decreased $10.5 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean Ambassador and the Ocean Worker to the Mexican GOM in the second half of 2003. This decrease was partially offset by additional operating expense related to the reactivation of the Ocean Voyager from cold stacked status during 2004 and normal operations during the fourth quarter of that year. Mexican GOM. Revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersibles in the Mexican GOM increased $48.5 million compared to the revenues earned in this region in 2003. We had four drilling units operating in this market throughout 2004, as compared to 2003 when the Ocean Ambassador, Ocean Whittington and Ocean Worker commenced operations for PEMEX in the Mexican GOM during the third quarter. The Ocean Yorktown was relocated to the Mexican GOM in July 2003 from Brazil and began operating under contract with PEMEX in the mid fourth quarter of 2003. 34 Table of Contents In the Mexican GOM, our intermediate semisubmersibles incurred higher operating expenses in 2004 as compared to 2003, when two of these rigs operated in the GOM and another rig was stacked in Africa for the first five months of the year. The increased operating costs in 2004, which resulted from the increased utilization in 2004 compared to the prior year, included additional equipment rental expense in connection with the rigs contracts with PEMEX, travel costs and costs associated with maintaining a Mexican shore base. These increased operating expenses were partially offset by lower rig mobilization costs in 2004, as compared to 2003, when we incurred additional costs to relocate these rigs to the Mexican GOM. Australia/Asia. Our intermediate semisubmersibles working offshore Australia/Asia generated revenues of $77.2 million in 2004 compared to revenues of $48.1 million in 2003. The $29.0 million increase in revenues was primarily due to increased utilization in 2004 compared to 2003. Utilization in this market increased to 91% in 2004 from 70% in 2003. In 2003, utilization in this region was reduced due to the ready stacking of the Ocean Epoch for the majority of the year and nearly two months of unpaid downtime for the Ocean Bounty due to a scheduled 5 year survey and related repairs. In 2004, we relocated the Ocean Patriot to this region from South Africa, resulting in additional revenues of $11.5 million in this region, including $3.3 million in mobilization revenue. The $14.7 million increase in contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersibles in the Australia/Asia region in 2004, as compared to 2003, was primarily due to additional costs associated with preparing the Ocean Patriot for operations in New Zealand and Australia, including mobilization of the rig from South Africa. Our operating costs for 2004 also included normal operating expenses for the Ocean Epoch, as compared to reduced costs in 2003 when the rig was ready stacked for most of the year. Europe/Africa. Overall utilization of our actively marketed intermediate semisubmersibles in this region increased from 67% in 2003 to 75% in 2004, reflecting the full utilization of the Ocean Princess and Ocean Guardian in 2004, as compared to 2003 when both rigs were ready stacked for part of the year, and which was partially offset by reduced utilization due to our relocation of the Ocean Patriot to New Zealand in mid 2004. Excluding the results for the Ocean Vanguard, which operated under a bareboat charter arrangement with its previous owner for the first five months of 2003, the net favorable change in utilization in this region and modest increase in average operating dayrates during 2004, as compared to 2003, resulted in additional revenues of $2.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively. The Ocean Vanguard generated $13.8 million in additional revenues in 2004, primarily as a result of a higher average operating dayrate earned in 2004 compared to 2003. The average operating dayrate for the Ocean Vanguard increased from $10,000 in 2003 to an average of $77,300 in 2004 as a result of the completion of its bareboat charter arrangement in June 2003. Contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating offshore Europe increased $19.6 million during 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating costs for the Ocean Vanguard in 2004, as compared to reduced costs incurred in 2003 when the rig operated under a bareboat charter to its previous owner. This increase also included costs associated with preparing the Ocean Vanguard for work in the North Sea. Additionally, contract drilling expenses for our rigs working offshore the U.K. were negatively impacted in 2004 by the cost of additional labor benefits mandated by legislation in the region and the recognition of mobilization costs related to the relocation of the Ocean Nomad from the U.K. to Gabon where the unit operated until the fourth quarter of 2004. South America. Revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersible fleet operating offshore Brazil decreased $33.3 million during 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean Yorktown to the Mexican GOM in the third quarter of 2003 at a reduced dayrate and the renewal of our operating contract for the Ocean Yatzy in the latter part of 2003 at a significantly lower operating dayrate that reflected market conditions at the time. Operating costs for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs offshore Brazil decreased $2.9 million in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean Yorktown to the Mexican GOM. The decrease in overall costs for our Brazilian operations was partially offset by higher rig inspection and related repair costs, as well as higher benefits costs for national employees, for our two remaining intermediate semisubmersibles in this region in 2004, as compared to 2003. 35 Table of Contents Jack Ups. Year Ended December 31, Favorable/ 2004 2003 (Unfavorable) (In thousands) CONTRACT DRILLING REVENUE GOM $ 138,886 $ 84,795 $ 54,091 Australia/Asia 21,290 12,979 8,311 South America 18,215 18,215 Total Contract Drilling Revenue $ 178,391 $ 97,774 $ 80,617 CONTRACT DRILLING EXPENSE GOM $ 89,906 $ 84,343 $ (5,563 ) Australia/Asia 15,546 12,962 (2,584 ) South America 9,014 (9,014 ) Total Contract Drilling Expense $ 114,466 $ 97,305 $ (17,161 ) OPERATING INCOME $ 63,925 $ 469 $ 63,456 GOM. Excluding the Ocean Champion, which was reactivated from cold stack status in 2004, utilization of our jack ups in the GOM rose to 92% in 2004 from 80% in 2003, resulting in $12.9 million in additional revenues in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in utilization in 2004 was primarily due to the nearly full utilization of the Ocean Tower and Ocean Titan, which were in shipyards undergoing major upgrades for a significant portion of 2003. Other changes in utilization were primarily due to the timing and duration of inspections and related repairs. The reactivated Ocean Champion generated revenues of $4.5 million in 2004. All of our jack ups in this region experienced an increase in average dayrate in 2004 primarily due to a tighter market for this class of equipment in the GOM. Average operating revenue per day increased from $26,400 in 2003 to $36,400 in 2004, resulting in $36.7 million in additional revenues in 2004. Our operating costs for jack ups in the GOM increased $5.6 million in 2004 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating costs for the Ocean Titan during 2004, compared to 2003 when most of this rigs costs were capitalized in connection with its cantilever upgrade, reactivation costs for the Ocean Champion and additional, normal operating costs associated with higher utilization of our jack up fleet in the GOM. Australia/Asia. Revenue improvements for our jack ups in the Australia/Asia region are primarily due to the nearly full utilization of the Ocean Sovereign in 2004 compared to 2003, when this unit was out of service for a major upgrade for a significant portion of the year ($13.2 million). This increase was partially offset by lower revenues for the Ocean Heritage, which in 2004 operated in this region for only a portion of the fourth quarter. During 2003, the Ocean Heritage operated offshore Indonesia prior to being stacked for the latter half of the year in a Singapore shipyard. We mobilized this drilling unit to Ecuador in early 2004. We recognized $2.4 million in mobilization fees for jack up rig moves in 2004. Contract drilling expense for our jack ups in this region increased in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to higher utilization and mobilization costs for the Ocean Sovereign in 2004 compared to 2003, when this rig was outof service for a major upgrade and then ready stacked in Singapore. During 2003, a majority of operating costs for the Ocean Sovereign were capitalized as part of its upgrade. South America. The Ocean Heritage operated offshore Ecuador for almost eight months in 2004. During its contract the rig generated $18.2 million in revenues, including the recognition of $8.5 million in lump sum mobilization fees, and incurred operating expenses of $9.0 million before returning to the Australia/Asia region in the fourth quarter of 2004. 36 Table of Contents Reimbursable expenses, net. Revenues related to reimbursable items, offset by the related expenditures for these items, were $3.4 million in 2004 compared to $2.8 million in 2003. Reimbursable expenses include items that we purchase, and or services we perform, at the request of our customers. We charge our customers for purchases and or services we perform on their behalf at cost, plus a mark up where applicable. Therefore, net reimbursables fluctuate based on customer requirements, which vary. Depreciation. Depreciation expense in 2004 increased $3.2 million to $178.8 million, compared to $175.6 million in 2003, primarily due to additional depreciation expense associated with upgrades to the Ocean Rover and two jack up rigs completed in 2003 and another jack up rig completed in early 2004, the Ocean Patriot, which we acquired in March 2003, and capital expenditures in the third quarter 2003 related to contracts for four of our rigs in Mexico. On April 1, 2003, we adjusted the estimated service lives and salvage values for most of our drilling rigs to better reflect their remaining economic lives and salvage values. We incurred $5.3 million more in depreciation expense for the first quarter of 2003 than that which we would have incurred using the new service lives and salvage values. See Critical Accounting Estimates. General and Administrative Expense. Our general and administrative expense increased $3.9 million in 2004 to $32.8 million, as compared to $28.9 million for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher payroll costs, our cost of compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, higher external audit fees and higher net building expenses due to lower rental income from our tenants. Loss on Sale and Disposition of Assets. During 2004, we wrote off $1.6 million of equipment that was lost during Hurricane Ivan. During 2003, we recognized net losses on the sale and disposition of assets of $0.9 million, primarily related to the sale of two of our semisubmersible drilling rigs, the Ocean Century and Ocean Prospector. These rigs, which had been cold stacked since July 1998 and October 1998, respectively, were permanently retired from service as offshore drilling rigs and written down by $1.6 million to their fair market values in September 2003. We sold these rigs for $375,000 each (pre tax) in December 2003. Interest Expense. We incurred interest expense of $30.3 million in 2004 compared to interest expense of $23.9 million in 2003. The $6.4 million increase in interest costs is primarily attributable to our 5.15% Senior Notes, which we issued on August 27, 2004, and was partially offset by lower interest expense in 2003 as a result of interest we capitalized relating to the upgrade of the Ocean Rover, which was completed in July 2003. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Capitalized Interest and Note 7 Long Term Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Gain (Loss) on Sale of Marketable Securities. We recognized net gains on sales of marketable securities of $0.3 million in 2004 compared to a $6.9 million net loss on the sale of marketable securities in 2003. See Note 3 Investments and Marketable Securities to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 37 Table of Contents Settlement of Litigation. In December 2004, we recognized an $11.4 million gain as a result of the settlement of our lawsuit against an equipment manufacturer. This lawsuit was the result of an incident that occurred in 2002 on the Ocean Baroness. Other Income and Expense (Other, net). We reported other income of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, which included $1.4 million in foreign currency transaction losses. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we recognized other income of $2.9 million primarily related to pre tax gains on foreign exchange forward contracts. See Note 4 Derivative Financial Instruments Forward Exchange Contracts to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Income Tax (Expense) Benefit. Our net income tax expense or benefit is a function of the mix between our domestic and international pre tax earnings or losses, respectively, as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognized income tax expense of $3.7 million on a pre tax loss of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to a tax benefit of $5.8 million, which we recognized on a pre tax loss of $54.2 million in 2003. Certain of our rigs that operate internationally are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited, a Cayman Island subsidiary that we wholly own. We do not intend to remit earnings from this subsidiary to the U.S. and we plan to indefinitely reinvest these earnings internationally. Consequently, we provided no U.S. taxes on earnings and recognized no U.S. tax benefits on losses during 2004 or 2003. We recognized tax expense of $3.7 million for 2004 despite a $3.5 million pre tax loss primarily as a result of $20.5 million of unrepatriated losses in international tax jurisdictions for which we did not recognize any U.S benefits. Our tax expense for 2004 also included $2.5 million associated with a revision to estimates in tax balance sheet accounts, a tax benefit of $5.2 million related to goodwill arising from our merger with Arethusa (Off Shore) Limited in 1996 and a tax benefit of $4.5 million due to the reversal of a tax liability associated with the Ocean Alliance Lease Leaseback. In 2003, we recorded a valuation allowance of $10.2 million for certain of our foreign tax credit carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2011 as a charge against earnings. Under the more likely than not approach of evaluating the associated deferred tax asset, at that time we determined that a valuation allowance was necessary. See Overview Critical Accounting Estimates Income Taxes. In addition, in 2003 we reduced our deferred tax liability by $3.7 million related to the deductibility of goodwill associated with a 1996 acquisition. 38 Table of Contents Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from our operations, proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and our cash reserves. At December 31, 2005, we had $842.6 million in Cash and cash equivalents and $2.3 million in Investments and marketable securities, representing our investment of cash available for current operations. Cash Flows from Operations. We operate in an industry that has been, and we expect to continue to be, extremely competitive and highly cyclical. The dayrates we receive for our drilling rigs and rig utilization rates are a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace, which is generally correlated with the price of oil and natural gas. Demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development, a variety of political and economic factors and availability of rigs in a particular geographic region. As utilization rates increase, dayrates tend to increase as well reflecting the lower supply of available rigs, and vice versa. These factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict. For a description of other factors that could affect our cash flows from operations, see Overview Industry Conditions, Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. Shelf Registration. We have the ability to issue an aggregate of approximately $117.5 million in debt, equity and other securities under a shelf registration statement. In addition, from time to time we may issue up to eight million shares of common stock which are registered under an acquisition shelf registration statement, after giving effect to the two for one stock split we declared in July 1997, in connection with one or more acquisitions by us of securities or assets of other businesses. Liquidity and Capital Requirements Our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements. We determine the amount of cash required to meet our capital commitments by evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, including water depth and drilling capability upgrades. We believe that our operating cash flows and cash reserves will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments; however, we will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions. In addition, we may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. Our ability to effect any such issuance will be dependent on our results of operations, our current financial condition, current market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our business requirements in the foreseeable future, including capital expenditures for rig upgrades and enhancements, as well as our working capital requirements. Contractual Cash Obligations. The following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2005. Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years (In thousands) Long term debt principal $ 977,654 $ $ 459,987 $ 18,720 $ 498,947 Forward exchange contracts 122,493 116,846 5,647 Purchase obligations related to rig upgrade/modifications 411,000 259,000 152,000 Operating leases 2,474 1,892 582 Total obligations $ 1,513,621 $ 377,738 $ 618,216 $ 18,720 $ 498,947 39 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2005, we had purchase obligations aggregating approximately $411 million related to the major upgrade of the Ocean Endeavor and construction of two new jack up rigs, the Ocean Scepter and Ocean Shield. We had no other purchase obligations for major rig upgrades or any other significant obligations at December 31, 2005, except for those related to our direct rig operations, which arise during the normal course of business. Payments of our long term debt, including interest, could be accelerated due to certain rights that holders of our debentures have to put the securities to us. See the discussion below related to our 1.5% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2031, or 1.5% Debentures, and Zero Coupon Debentures. 4.875% Senior Notes. On June 14, 2005, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes at an offering price of 99.785% of the principal amount, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $247.6 million. These notes bear interest at 4.875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning January 1, 2006, and mature on July 1, 2015. The 4.875% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. We have the right to redeem all or a portion of the 4.875% Senior Notes for cash at any time or from time to time on at least 15 days but not more than 60 days prior written notice, at the redemption price specified in the governing indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. 5.15% Senior Notes. On August 27, 2004, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.15% Senior Notes at an offering price of 99.759% of the principal amount, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $247.6 million. These notes bear interest at 5.15% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 2005, and mature on September 1, 2014. The 5.15% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. We have the right to redeem all or a portion of the 5.15% Senior Notes for cash at any time or from time to time on at least 15 days but not more than 60 days prior written notice, at the redemption price specified in the governing indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. 1.5% Debentures. On April 11, 2001, we issued $460.0 million principal amount of 1.5% Debentures, which are due April 15, 2031. The 1.5% Debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 20.3978 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures, or $49.02 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we have the right to deliver cash in lieu of shares of our common stock. We pay interest of 1.5% per year on the outstanding principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures, semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year. In addition, under certain circumstances we will pay contingent interest to holders of our 1.5% Debentures during any six month period commencing after April 14, 2008. See 1.5% Debentures in Note 7 Long Term Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The 1.5% Debentures are unsecured obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their 1.5% Debentures on April 15, 2008, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. In addition, holders may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their 1.5% Debentures upon a change in control (as defined in the governing indenture) for a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem all or a portion of the 1.5% Debentures at any time on or after April 15, 2008, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Zero Coupon Debentures. We issued our Zero Coupon Debentures on June 6, 2000 at a price of $499.60 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which represents a yield to maturity of 3.50% per year. The Zero Coupon Debentures mature on June 6, 40 Table of Contents 2020, and, as of December 31, 2005, the aggregate accreted value of our outstanding Zero Coupon Debentures was $18.7 million. We will not pay interest prior to maturity unless we elect to convert the Zero Coupon Debentures to interest bearing debentures upon the occurrence of certain tax events. The Zero Coupon Debentures are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into our common stock at a fixed conversion rate of 8.6075 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of Zero Coupon Debentures, subject to adjustments in certain events. In addition, holders may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their Zero Coupon Debentures upon a change in control (as defined in the governing indenture) for a purchase price equal to the accreted value through the date of repurchase. The Zero Coupon Debentures are senior unsecured obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. We also have the right to redeem the Zero Coupon Debentures, in whole or in part, for a price equal to the issuance price plus accrued original issue discount through the date of redemption. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase the Zero Coupon Debentures on June 6, 2010 and June 6, 2015, at the accreted value through the date of repurchase. We may pay any such repurchase price with either cash or shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. On June 7, 2005, we repurchased $460.0 million accreted value, or $774.1 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity, of our Zero Coupon Debentures at a purchase price of $594.25 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which represented 96% of our then outstanding Zero Coupon Debentures. The aggregate principal amount at maturity of those Zero Coupon Debentures will be $30.9 million assuming no additional conversions or redemptions occur prior to the maturity date. Letters of Credit. We are contingently liable as of December 31, 2005 in the amount of $47.9 million under certain performance, bid, supersedeas and custom bonds and letters of credit. Agreements relating to approximately $34.0 million of multi year performance bonds can require cash collateral for the full line at any time for any reason. Issuers of a $0.5 million letter of credit have the option to require cash collateral due to the lowering of our credit rating in April 2004. As of December 31, 2005 we had not been required to make any cash collateral deposits with respect to these agreements. The remaining agreements cannot require cash collateral except in events of default. On our behalf, banks have issued letters of credit securing certain of these bonds. Credit Ratings. Our current credit rating is Baa2 for Moodys Investors Services and A for Standard Poors. Although our long term ratings continue at investment grade levels, lower ratings could result in higher interest rates on future debt issuances. Capital Expenditures. In May 2005, we began a major upgrade of the Ocean Endeavor for ultra deepwater service. The modernized rig will be capable of operating in up to 10,000 feet of water at an estimated upgrade cost of approximately $250 million. We spent approximately $54.5 million on this project in 2005 and expect to spend approximately $145 million in 2006. We expect delivery of the upgraded rig in mid 2007. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2005, we entered into agreements to construct two high performance, premium jack up rigs. The two new drilling units, the Ocean Scepter and the Ocean Shield, are under construction in Brownsville, Texas and in Singapore, respectively, at an aggregate expected cost of approximately $300 million. We spent $85.9 million in 2005 related to the new construction and expect to spend approximately $114 million in 2006 on these two construction projects. We expect delivery of both units in the first quarter of 2008. In January 2006, we announced that we will upgrade the currently cold stacked Ocean Monarch for ultra deepwater service at an aggregate estimated cost of approximately $300 million. We expect to mobilize the rig to a shipyard in Singapore for the upgrade in mid 2006 and expect to spend approximately $60 million on this project in 2006. We purchased the Ocean Monarch and its related equipment in August 2005 for $20.0 million. 41 Table of Contents We have budgeted approximately $215 million in additional capital expenditures in 2006 associated with our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, and other corporate requirements. We expect to finance our 2006 capital expenditures through the use of our existing cash balances or internally generated funds. During 2005, we spent approximately $133.4 million on our continuing rig capital maintenance program (other than rig upgrades and new construction) and to meet other corporate capital expenditure requirements in 2005. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had no off balance sheet debt or other arrangements. Historical Cash Flows The following is a discussion of our historical cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Change (In thousands) Net income (loss) $ 260,337 $ (7,243 ) $ 267,580 Net changes in operating assets and liabilities (81,039 ) 22,385 (103,424 ) Loss (gain) on sale of marketable securities 1,180 (254 ) 1,434 Depreciation and other non cash items, net 208,093 193,394 14,699 $ 388,571 $ 208,282 $ 180,289 Our cash flows from operations in 2005 increased $180.3 million or 87% over cash generated by our operating activities in 2004. The increase in cash flow from operations in 2005 is primarily the result of higher average dayrates and, to a lesser extent, higher utilization earned by our offshore drilling units as a result of an increase in worldwide demand for offshore contract drilling services. These favorable trends were negatively impacted by an increase in cash required to satisfy our working capital requirements, including a temporary increase in our trade accounts receivable, which will generate cash as the billing cycle is completed.

In 2005, we sold marketable securities, net of purchases, of $654.3 million compared to net purchases of $140.3 million during 2004. This increase in net sales activity is primarily the result of increased cash requirements in 2005 to partially fund our repurchase of $460.0 million accreted value of Zero Coupon Debentures in June 2005 and capital additions. 42 Table of Contents During 2005, we spent approximately $140.4 million related to the major upgrade of the Ocean Endeavor and construction of two new jack up drilling rigs, the Ocean Scepter and Ocean Shield, in addition to $133.4 million related to our ongoing capital maintenance program and our purchase of the Ocean Monarch for $20.0 million. During 2004, our primary focus was on our ongoing capital maintenance program. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures. We collected $50.5 million in insurance proceeds related to the casualty loss of the Ocean Warwick in 2005. Additionally, in 2005 we sold one of our then cold stacked intermediate semisubmersible rigs, the Ocean Liberator, for net cash proceeds of $13.6 million and received $5.6 million in insurance proceeds (total proceeds of $14.5 million of which $8.9 million is included in net cash provided by operating activities) related to the involuntary conversion of assets damaged during Hurricane Ivan in 2004. In the second quarter of 2004, based on our expectation that higher interest rates could be achieved by investing in Australian dollar based securities, we invested $42.1 million (equivalent to 60.0 million Australian dollars) in Australian dollar time deposits with expirations ranging from May 2004 to March 2005. During 2005 and 2004, $11.8 million and $34.1 million matured, respectively. Also during 2005, we entered into various foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which resulted in net realized gains totaling $1.1 million. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities.

We repurchased $460.0 million accreted value, or approximately 96%, of our then outstanding Zero Coupon Debentures for cash in June 2005. During 2005, we received $11.5 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options to purchase shares of our common stock. During 2004, we received $0.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. We paid cash dividends to our stockholders of $48.3 million in 2005 compared to $32.3 million in 2004. On January 24, 2006, we declared a quarterly cash dividend and a special cash dividend of $0.125 and $1.50, respectively, per share of our common stock. Both the quarterly and special cash dividends are payable on March 1, 2006 to stockholders of record on February 3, 2006. Depending on market conditions, we may, from time to time, purchase shares of our common stock in the open market or otherwise. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we purchased 782,200 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $18.1 million (or $23.11 average cost per share). We did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. We paid the final installment of $12.8 million on our lease leaseback arrangement for the Ocean Alliance in December 2005. 43 Table of Contents Other Currency Risk. Some of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their operations in the local currency of the country where they conduct operations. Currency environments in which we have significant business operations include Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia. When possible, we attempt to minimize our currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to our estimated operating costs payable in local currency with the balance of the contract payable in U.S. dollars. At present, however, only a limited number of our contracts are payable both in U.S. dollars and the local currency. We also utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce our forward exchange risk. A forward currency exchange contract obligates a contract holder to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specific dates. We record currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses as Other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The effect on our results of operations from these translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses has not been material and are not expected to have a significant effect in the future. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004 the Financial Accounting Standards Board revised SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, or SFAS 123 (R). This statement supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. This statement requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS 123 (R) is effective as of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after that date. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 123 (R) to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The information included in this Item 7A is considered to constitute forward looking statements for purposes of the statutory safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements in Item 7 of this report. Our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments. Market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. We believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur. Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by our senior management. Senior management approves the overall investment strategy that we employ and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to us. We may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. Our investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities. We monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates. The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity. The analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period. The sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly, the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our earnings or stockholders equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Our long term debt, as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates, and as such, interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of $173.8 million and $177.8 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A 100 basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of $40.0 million and $217.3 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 47 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. During 2004 we invested in fixed rate Australian dollar time deposits and 15.0 million Australian dollars (equivalent to $11.6 million) of time deposits were included in Investments and marketable securities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2004. These time deposits matured during the first quarter of 2005. During 2005 we entered into various forward exchange contracts requiring us to purchase predetermined amounts of foreign currencies at predetermined dates. As of December 31, 2005, we had foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding requiring us to purchase the equivalent of $17.1 million in Mexican pesos, the equivalent of $7.7 million in Australian dollars, the equivalent of $67.2 million in British pounds sterling and the equivalent of $30.5 million in Brazilian Reals at various times through March 2007. These forward exchange contracts were included in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005 at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their levels at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The following table presents our exposure to market risk by category (interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates): Fair Value Asset (Liability) Market Risk December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 2005 2004 (In thousands) Interest rate: Marketable securities $ 2,281 (a) $ 650,247 (a) $ 200 (c) $ 2,100 (c) Long term debt (1,159,941 ) (b) (1,213,820 ) (b) Foreign Exchange: Australian dollar time deposits 11,602 (d) 2,300 (d) Forward exchange contracts 400 (d) 21,500 (d) (a) The fair market value of our investment in marketable securities is based on the quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2005 and 2004. (b) The fair values of our 4.875% Senior Notes, 5.15% Senior Notes, 1.5% Debentures and Zero Coupon Debentures are based on the quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2005 and 2004. The fair value of our Ocean Alliance lease leaseback agreement is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 4.27% for December 31, 2004. (c) The calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points at December 31, 2005 and 2004. (d) The calculation of estimated foreign exchange risk is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of an increase in foreign exchange rates of 20% at December 31, 2005 and a decrease in foreign exchange rates of 20% at December 31, 2004. 48 Table of Contents
