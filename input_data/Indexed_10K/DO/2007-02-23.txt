Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements (including the Notes thereto) in Item 8 of this report. We provide contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe and are a leader in deepwater drilling with a fleet of 44 offshore drilling rigs. Our fleet currently consists of 30 semisubmersibles, 13 jack ups and one drillship. In addition, we have two jack up drilling units on order at shipyards in Brownsville, Texas and Singapore. We expect both of these units to be delivered during the first quarter of 2008. Overview Industry Conditions Worldwide demand for our mid water (intermediate) and deepwater (high specification) semisubmersible rigs and international jack up rigs remained strong during the fourth quarter of 2006. However, the jack up market in the GOM continues to experience downward pricing pressure, with the potential for a given rig to be ready stacked for a period of time between wells. As of January 29, 2007, we had one ready stacked jack up unit. Exclusive of the GOM jack up market, which accounted for 12 percent of our total revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, solid fundamental market conditions remain in place for all classes of offshore drilling rigs worldwide, and both dayrates and term contract opportunities have continued to slowly increase. Gulf of Mexico. In the GOM, the market for our semisubmersible equipment remains firm. The dayrate on one of our seven high specification floaters in the GOM, for which we have received a letter of intent, or LOI, is as high as $500,000 for future work. However, the pace of contracting for these rigs has slowed due to the backlog of our existing agreements, all of which extend into 2008 or 2009, except for the most recent agreement which extends into 2012. Dayrates for our five intermediate semisubmersibles currently located in the GOM are as high as $300,000 for a current one well contract and a future three well contract. We continue to view the deepwater and intermediate markets in the GOM as under supplied and believe that the GOM semisubmersible market will remain strong in 2007. Our jack up fleet in the GOM experienced somewhat lower utilization during the fourth quarter of 2006, coupled with increasing downward pressure on dayrates, compared to the third quarter of 2006. This situation began in the second quarter of 2006. We believe that the current pricing pressure on jack up rigs in the GOM will extend at least until the second quarter of 2007. We expect two of our intermediate semisubmersibles, the Ocean New Era and Ocean Voyager, to mobilize from the GOM to the Mexican GOM in the third quarter of 2007 under approximately 21/2 year contracts both ending in early 2010. The rigs have commitments at dayrates of $265,000 and $335,000, respectively. The terms of our drilling contracts with PEMEX for these rigs expose us to greater risks than we normally assume, such as exposure to increased environmental liability. In addition, each contract can be terminated by PEMEX on short term notice, contractually or by statute, subject to certain conditions, although we view this eventuality as unlikely. We expect the market for the Mexican GOM to remain strong in 2007. Brazil. Two of our rigs operating in Brazil are currently working under term contracts with Petrobras that expire in 2009, and two additional rigs are operating under contracts expiring in 2010. Petrobras is continuing to seek additional intermediate semisubmersible rigs, and we expect the Brazilian semisubmersible demand to remain strong in 2007. North Sea. Effective industry utilization remains at 100 percent in the North Sea where we have three intermediate semisubmersible rigs in the U.K. and one intermediate unit in Norway. Indicating the strength of this market, one of our four rigs in the North Sea recently received a term contract extending until the second quarter of 2009, with an option until late March 2007 to convert to a two year contract ending in 2010. The other three rigs have term contracts that extend into 2010. Australia/Asia/Middle East/Mediterranean. We currently have five semisubmersible rigs and one jack up unit operating in the Australia/Asia market, and two jack up rigs and one intermediate floater operating in the Middle 19 Table of Contents East/Mediterranean sector. All nine of these rigs are operating under contracts for work extending into 2007, 2008 or 2009. During the third quarter of 2006, one of our new build jack up rigs, the Ocean Shield, which is currently under construction in Singapore, received a one year term contract at a dayrate of $265,000, with the option until late March 2007 to convert to a two year contract, but at a slightly lower dayrate. Under the agreement, the rig is scheduled to begin work offshore Australia upon completion of construction and commissioning of the rig, which is estimated to occur in the first quarter of 2008. We believe that the Australia/Asia and Middle East/Mediterranean markets will remain strong in 2007. Contract Drilling Backlog The following table reflects our contract drilling backlog as of February 19, 2007 and February 6, 2006 (the date reported in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2005) and reflects both firm commitments (typically represented by signed contracts), as well as LOIs. An LOI is subject to customary conditions, including the execution of a definitive agreement. Contract drilling backlog is based on the full contractual dayrate for our drilling rigs and is calculated assuming full utilization of our drilling equipment for the contract period. The amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors. Utilization rates, which generally approach 95 98% can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including, but not limited to, unscheduled repairs, maintenance and weather. Our contract backlog is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period, excluding revenues for mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and customer reimbursables. Changes in our contract drilling backlog between periods is a function of both the performance of work on term contracts, as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts.

The percentage of rig days committed is calculated as the ratio of total days committed under contracts and LOIs and scheduled shipyard and survey days for all rigs in our fleet to total available days (number of rigs multiplied by the number of days in a particular year). Total available days have been calculated based on the expected delivery dates for the Ocean Endeavor, Ocean Monarch, and our two newbuild jack up rigs, the Ocean Scepter and Ocean Shield.

In late August 2005, one of our jack up drilling rigs, the Ocean Warwick, was seriously damaged during Hurricane Katrina and other rigs in our fleet, as well as our warehouse in New Iberia, Louisiana, sustained lesser damage in Hurricane Katrina or Rita, or both storms. We believe that the physical damage to our rigs, as well as related removal and recovery costs, are primarily covered by insurance, after applicable deductibles. At December 31, 2006, we had filed several insurance claims related to the 2005 storms which are currently under review by insurance adjusters or are pending underwriter approval. Our results for 2005, and to a lesser extent 2006, reflect the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Ocean Warwick, with a net book value of $14.0 million, was declared a constructive total loss effective August 29, 2005. We issued a proof of loss in the amount of $50.5 million to our insurers, representing the insured value of the rig less a $4.5 million deductible. We received all insurance proceeds related to this claim in 2005. Recovery and removal of the Ocean Warwick are subject to separate insurance deductibles which were estimated at the time of loss to be $2.5 million in the aggregate. In the third quarter of 2005, we recorded a net $33.6 million casualty gain for the Ocean Warwick, representing net insurance proceeds of $50.5 million, less the write off of the $14.0 million net carrying value of the drilling rig and $0.4 million in rig based spare parts and supplies, and estimated insurance deductibles aggregating $2.5 million for salvage and wreck removal. We have presented this as Casualty Gain on Ocean Warwick in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in Item 8 of this report. During 2006, we subsequently revised our estimate of expected deductibles related to salvage and wreck removal of the Ocean Warwick to $2.0 million and recorded a $0.5 million adjustment to Casualty Gain on Ocean Warwick in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in Item 8 of this report. Damage to our other affected rigs and warehouse was less severe. At the time of loss, we estimated insurance deductibles related to the remaining rigs damaged during Hurricane Katrina and our rigs and facility damaged by Hurricane Rita to total $2.6 million in the aggregate, of which $1.2 million and $1.4 million were recorded as additional contract drilling expense and loss on disposition of assets, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005 in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in Item 8 of this report. Subsequently, during 2006, we revised our estimate of the applicable deductibles related to these damages and recorded a $0.4 million gain on disposition of assets in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in Item 8 of this report. In addition, in the third quarter of 2005 and during 2006, we wrote off the aggregate net book value of approximately $14.3 million in rig equipment that was either lost or damaged beyond repair during these storms as loss on disposition of assets and recorded a corresponding insurance receivable in an amount equal to our expected recovery from insurers. The write off of this equipment and recognition of insurance receivables had no net effect on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. During the third and fourth quarters of 2005, we incurred additional operating expenses, including but not limited to the cost of rig crew over time and employee assistance, hurricane relief supplies, temporary housing and office space and the rental of mooring equipment, of $5.1 million relating to relief and recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which we do not expect to be recoverable through our insurance. In late 2006 we received $3.1 million from certain of our customers primarily related to the replacement or repair of equipment damaged during the 2005 hurricanes. We recorded $0.3 million of this recovery as a credit to 21 Table of Contents contract drilling expense, $1.1 million as a gain on disposition of assets and the remaining $1.8 million as other income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in Item 8 of this report. General Our revenues vary based upon demand, which affects the number of days our fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned. When a rig is idle, no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result. Revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs, required surveys and shipyard upgrades. In order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates, we may mobilize our rigs from one market to another. However, during periods of mobilization, revenues may be adversely affected. As a response to changes in demand, we may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously, which may decrease or increase revenues, respectively. The two most significant variables affecting revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates, each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace. As utilization rates increase, dayrates tend to increase as well, reflecting the lower supply of available rigs, and vice versa. Demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development, as well as a variety of political and economic factors. The availability of rigs in a particular geographical region also affects both dayrates and utilization rates. These factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict. We recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed. In connection with such drilling contracts, we may receive lump sum fees for the mobilization of equipment. We earn these fees as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. We defer mobilization fees received, as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred, and amortize each, on a straight line basis, over the term of the related drilling contracts (which is the period estimated to be benefited from the mobilization activity). Straight line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts (which generally range from two to 60 months) is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed. Absent a contract, mobilization costs are recognized currently. From time to time, we may receive fees from our customers for capital improvements to our rigs. We defer such fees and recognize them into income on a straight line basis over the period of the related drilling contract as a component of contract drilling revenue. We capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of the improvement. We receive reimbursements for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services and other services provided at the request of our customers in accordance with a contract or agreement. We record these reimbursements at the gross amount billed to the customer, as Revenues related to reimbursable expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in Item 8 of this report. Operating Income. Our operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors, but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses. Our operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling equipment. The principal components of our operating costs are, among other things, direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory inspections, boat and helicopter rentals and insurance. Labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most significant components of our operating expenses. In general, our labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels, rig staffing requirements, inflation and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which our rigs operate. We have experienced and continue to experience upward pressure on salaries and wages as a result of the strengthening offshore drilling market and increased competition for skilled workers. In response to these market conditions we have implemented retention programs, including increases in compensation. Costs to repair and maintain our equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing, as well as the age and condition of the equipment. Operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and may not be significantly affected by short term fluctuations in utilization. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or ready stacked state 22 Table of Contents with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract. However, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, we may reduce the size of a rigs crew and take steps to cold stack the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income. We recognize, as incurred, operating expenses related to activities such as inspections, painting projects and routine overhauls that meet certain criteria and which maintain rather than upgrade our rigs. These expenses vary from period to period. Costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements. Higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades. Periods of high, sustained utilization may result in cost increases for maintenance and repairs in order to maintain our equipment in proper, working order. In addition, during periods of high activity and dayrates, higher prices generally pervade the entire offshore drilling industry and its support businesses, which cause our costs for goods and services to increase. Our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections, which we refer to as a 5 year survey, or special survey, that are due every five years for each of our rigs. Operating revenue decreases because these surveys are performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard. Operating expenses increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs. Repair and maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of rigs undergoing a 5 year survey will vary from year to year. In addition, operating income may be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim periods between 5 year surveys. Intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a 5 year survey. Although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the drilling rig, it normally does not require dry docking or shipyard time. During 2007, we expect to spend an aggregate of approximately $46 million for 5 year surveys and intermediate surveys, including estimated mobilization costs, but excluding any resulting repair and maintenance costs, which could be significant. Costs of mobilizing our rigs to shipyards for scheduled surveys, which were a major component of our survey related costs during 2006, are indicative of higher prices commanded by support businesses to the offshore drilling industry. We expect mobilization costs to be a significant component of our survey related costs in 2007. When we renewed our principal insurance policies effective May 1, 2006, coverage for offshore drilling rigs, if available, was offered at substantially higher premiums than in the past and was subject to an increasing number of coverage limitations, due in part to underwriting losses suffered by the insurance industry as a result of damage caused by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico in 2004 and 2005. In some cases, quoted renewal premiums increased by more than 200%, with the addition of substantial deductibles and limits on the amount of claims payable for losses arising from named windstorms. In light of these factors, we determined that retention of additional risk was preferable to paying dramatically higher premiums for limited coverage. Accordingly, we have elected to self insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. For our other physical damage coverage, our deductible is $150.0 million per occurrence (or lower for some rigs if they are declared a constructive total loss). As a result of our reduced coverage, our premiums for this coverage were reduced from the amounts we paid in 2005 and were lower than the renewal rates quoted by our insurance carriers. We also renewed our liability policies in May 2006, with an increase in premiums and deductibles. Our new deductibles under these policies have generally increased to $5.0 million per occurrence, but our deductibles arising in connection with certain liabilities relating to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have increased to $10.0 million per occurrence, with no annual aggregate deductible. In addition, we elected to self insure a portion of our excess liability coverage related to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To the extent that we incur certain liabilities related to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in excess of $75.0 million, we are self insured for up to a maximum retention of $17.5 million per occurrence in addition to these deductibles. We are currently in the early stages of renewing our insurance policies that expire on May 1, 2007. Currently we are unable to predict what changes, if any, we may make to our insurance coverage on or after May 1, 2007. 23 Table of Contents If named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico cause significant damage to our rigs or equipment or to the property of others for which we may be liable, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Insurance premiums will be amortized as expense over the applicable policy periods which generally expire at the end of April 2007. Construction and Capital Upgrade Projects. We capitalize interest cost for the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost, or SFAS 34. During 2006 and 2005, we began capitalizing interest on our two capital upgrade projects and the construction of our two new jack up rigs. Pursuant to SFAS 34, the period of interest capitalization covers the duration of the activities required to make the asset ready for its intended use, and the capitalization period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. In 2006 we began capitalizing interest on expenditures related to the capital upgrade of the Ocean Monarch and the construction of our two jack up rigs, and in 2005, we began capitalizing interest on expenditures related to the upgrade of the Ocean Endeavor. See Note 1 General Information Capitalized Interest to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. As of December 31, 2006, the shipyard portion of the Ocean Endeavors upgrade had been completed, and the rig is currently undergoing sea trials and commissioning in Singapore. We will continue to capitalize interest costs related to this upgrade until sea trials and commissioning are completed and the rig is loaded out on a heavy lift vessel for its return to the GOM, which we anticipate will occur at the end of the first quarter of 2007. We believe that this point in time represents the completion of the construction phase of the upgrade project, as the newly upgraded rig will be ready for its intended use. Accordingly, we will then cease capitalizing interest costs related to this upgrade and will begin depreciating the newly upgraded rig. As a result of the scheduled delivery of the Ocean Endeavor, we anticipate that depreciation and interest expense in 2007 will increase by approximately $6 million (representing nine months of expense) and $2.5 million, respectively. Critical Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 General Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Judgments, assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies. We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows: Property, Plant and Equipment. We carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost. Maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments, which meet certain criteria, are capitalized. Depreciation is amortized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives. Our management makes judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization, useful lives and salvage values. Changes in these judgments, assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported. We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We utilize a probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. Our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following: dayrate by rig; utilization rate by rig (expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used); the per day operating cost for each rig if active, ready stacked or cold stacked; and salvage value for each rig. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we develop a matrix by assigning probabilities to various combinations of assumed utilization rates and dayrates. We also consider the impact of a 5% reduction in assumed dayrates for the cold stacked rigs (holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant), or alternatively the impact of a 5% reduction in utilization (again holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant) as part of our analysis. 24 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006, all of our drilling rigs were either under contract, in shipyards for surveys and or life extension projects or undergoing a major upgrade. Based on this knowledge, we determined that an impairment test of our drilling equipment was not needed as we are currently marketing all of our drilling units. We did not have any cold stacked rigs at December 31, 2006. We do not believe that current circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our property and equipment may not be recoverable. Managements assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. Personal Injury Claims. Effective May 1, 2006, in conjunction with our insurance policy renewals, we increased our deductible for liability coverage for personal injury claims, which primarily result from Jones Act liability in the Gulf of Mexico, to $5.0 million per occurrence, with no aggregate deductible. The Jones Act is a federal law that permits seamen to seek compensation for certain injuries during the course of their employment on a vessel and governs the liability of vessel operators and marine employers for the work related injury or death of an employee. Prior to this renewal, our uninsured retention of liability for personal injury claims was $0.5 million per claim with an additional aggregate annual deductible of $1.5 million. Our in house claims department estimates the amount of our liability for our retention. This department establishes a reserve for each of our personal injury claims by evaluating the existing facts and circumstances of each claim and comparing the circumstances of each claim to historical experiences with similar past personal injury claims. Our claims department also estimates our liability for personal injuries that are incurred but not reported by using historical data. From time to time, we may also engage experts to assist us in estimating our reserve for such personal injury claims. In 2006 we engaged an actuary to estimate our liability for personal injury claims based on our historical losses and utilizing various actuarial models. We reduced our reserve for personal injury claims by $8.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2006 based on an actuarial review from which we determined that our aggregate reserve for personal injury claims should be $35.0 million at December 31, 2006. The eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from our estimated amounts due to uncertainties such as: the severity of personal injuries claimed; significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims; the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated; inconsistent court decisions; and the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, or SFAS 109, which requires the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if necessary, which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach. For interim periods, we estimate our annual effective tax rate by forecasting our annual income before income tax, taxable income and tax expense in each of our tax jurisdictions. We make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to forecasting of our effective tax rate, the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits, and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit. During 2006 we were able to utilize all of the foreign tax credits available to us and we had no foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2006. At the end of 2005, we had a valuation allowance of $0.8 million for certain of our foreign tax credit carryforwards which was reversed during 2006 as the valuation allowance was no longer necessary. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, or FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold 25 Table of Contents and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the guidance provided in FIN 48 and expect to adopt FIN 48 in the first quarter of 2007. Although our assessment has not yet been finalized, upon adoption of FIN 48 we expect to recognize a cumulative effect adjustment for uncertain tax positions of approximately $30 million, which will be charged to results of operations and equity. Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 Comparative data relating to our revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are presented below.

Due to this continuing strong demand, our operating income in 2006 increased $566.0 million, or 151%, to $940.4 million, compared to $374.4 million in 2005. Dayrates have generally increased during 2006, compared to 2005, resulting in the generation of additional contract drilling revenues by our fleet. However, overall revenue increases were negatively impacted by the effect of downtime associated with mandatory surveys and related repair time and lower dayrates earned by some of our semisubmersible rigs due to 26 Table of Contents previously established job sequencing that caused the units to temporarily roll to older contracts with lower dayrates. Total contract drilling revenues in 2006 increased $808.1 million, or 69%, to $1,987.1 million compared to 2005. Our results in 2006 were also impacted by higher expenses related to our mooring enhancement and other hurricane preparedness activities, wage increases in late 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 and surveys performed during 2006. The increase in survey costs included higher expenses for survey related services and higher boat charges associated with moving rigs to and from shipyards. In addition, overall cost increases for maintenance and repairs between 2005 and 2006 reflect the impact of high, sustained utilization of our drilling units across our fleet and in all geographic locations in which we operate. The increase in overall operating and overhead costs also reflects the impact of higher prices throughout the offshore drilling industry and its support businesses. Total contract drilling expenses in 2006 increased $173.5 million, or 27%, to $812.1 million, compared to the same period in 2005. The increase in our operating expenses in 2006, as compared to 2005, was partially offset by an $8.0 million reduction in our reserve for personal injury claims based on an actuarial review. Our operating results in 2005 included a $33.6 million casualty gain due to the constructive total loss of the Ocean Warwick as a result of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 and an $8.0 million gain related to the June 2005 sale of the Ocean Liberator. High Specification Floaters.

Revenues generated by our high specification floaters operating in the GOM increased $270.0 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to higher average dayrates earned during the period and revenues generated by the Ocean Baroness, which relocated to the GOM from the Australia/Asia market in the latter half of 2005 ($58.1 million). Excluding the Ocean Baroness, average operating revenue per day for our rigs in this market increased to $242,000 during 2006, compared to $142,600 during 2005, generating additional revenues of $211.6 million. The higher overall dayrates achieved for our high specification floaters reflect the continuing high demand for this class of rig in the GOM. Average utilization for our high specification rigs operating in the GOM, excluding the contribution from the Ocean Baroness, increased slightly to 96% in 2006 compared to 2005, and resulted in $0.2 million in revenue. Operating costs during 2006 for our high specification floaters in the GOM increased $55.3 million over operating costs incurred during 2005. The increase in operating costs is primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating costs and amortization of mobilization expenses for the Ocean Baroness during 2006 ($30.6 million) compared to the prior year when this drilling rig operated offshore Indonesia. In addition, our operating expenses for 2006, compared to 2005, reflect higher labor and benefits costs related to late 2005 and first quarter of 2006 wage increases, higher repair and maintenance costs, and higher miscellaneous operating expenses, including catering costs. Our operating expenses in 2005 reflect a $2.0 million reduction in costs due to a recovery from a 27 Table of Contents customer for damages sustained by one of our GOM rigs during Hurricane Ivan in 2004, partially offset by the recognition of $0.5 million in deductibles for damages sustained during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Australia/Asia. Revenues generated by our high specification rigs in the Australia/Asia/Middle East market decreased $2.7 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean Baroness from this market to the GOM in the latter half of 2005. Prior to its relocation to the GOM, the Ocean Baroness generated $18.2 million in revenues during 2005. The decrease in revenues in 2006 was partially offset by additional revenue ($13.7 million) generated by an increase in the dayrate earned by the Ocean Rover compared to the prior year. The average operating revenue per day for this rig increased from $143,500 in 2005 to $181,500 in 2006 as a result of a new drilling program which began in the second quarter of 2006. Utilization improvements for the Ocean Rover during 2006, as compared to 2005 when the unit had 11 days of downtime for repairs, generated an additional $1.8 million in revenues. Operating costs for our rigs in the Australia/Asia/Middle East market decreased $11.4 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean Baroness to the GOM ($15.5 million). This decrease was partially offset by an increase in operating costs for the Ocean Rover during 2006, compared to the prior year, primarily related to higher personnel related costs as a result of late 2005 and March 2006 pay increases, increased agency fee costs (which are based on a percentage of revenues) and higher other miscellaneous operating expenses. South America. Revenues for our high specification rigs operating offshore Brazil increased $50.7 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to higher average dayrates earned by our rigs in this market ($44.1 million). Average operating revenue per day earned by the Ocean Alliance and the Ocean Clipper increased to $180,100 during 2006 up from $117,300 during the prior year as a result of contract renewals for both rigs in the latter part of 2005. Utilization for our rigs offshore Brazil increased from 89% in 2005 to 96% in 2006, contributing $6.6 million in additional revenues in 2006, primarily due to less downtime during 2006 for repairs. Contract drilling expenses for our operations offshore Brazil increased $13.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in costs is primarily due to higher labor, benefits and other personnel related costs as a result of 2005 and March 2006 pay increases and other compensation enhancement programs, increased agency fee costs (which are based on a percentage of revenues), higher freight costs and higher maintenance and project costs. Intermediate Semisubmersibles.

Revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the GOM during 2006 increased $124.8 million over the prior year primarily due to higher average operating dayrates and the operation of the Ocean New Era ($53.9 million) which was reactivated in December 2005. Average operating dayrates for the remainder of our GOM fleet of intermediate rigs increased from $77,300 in 2005 to $149,300 in 2006 and generated additional revenues of $82.2 million during 2006. Excluding the Ocean New Era, utilization fell from 87% in 2005 to 75% in 2006, resulting in an $11.3 million reduction in revenues generated in 2006 compared to 2005. Average utilization in 2006 was negatively impacted by approximately five months of downtime for the Ocean Saratoga in connection with its survey and related repairs, as well as a life enhancement upgrade that commenced in the third quarter of 2006 and approximately one month of downtime for both the Ocean Voyager and Ocean Concord for mooring upgrades. Partially offsetting the decline in average utilization in 2006 was an improvement in utilization for the Ocean Lexington, which worked nearly all of 2006 prior to its move to Egypt at the beginning of the fourth quarter. During 2005, the Ocean Lexington incurred over four months of downtime for a survey and life enhancement upgrade. Contract drilling expense for our GOM operations increased $30.6 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to normal operating costs for the Ocean New Era in 2006 ($7.6 million) and repair and other normal operating costs for the Ocean Whittington ($6.4 million) in the latter half of 2006 after its return from the Mexican GOM. Higher operating costs in 2006, as compared to 2005, reflect higher labor and benefits costs as a result of September 2005 and March 2006 wage increases for our rig based personnel, mobilization costs associated with mooring upgrades for the Ocean Concord and Ocean Voyager, survey and related repair costs for the Ocean Saratoga and higher maintenance and other miscellaneous operating costs for our semisubmersible rigs in this market segment. In addition, during 2006, we incurred $2.4 million in costs associated with the rental of mooring lines and chains as temporary replacements for equipment lost during the 2005 hurricanes in the GOM. Partially offsetting the increased operating costs in 2006 was the absence of reactivation costs for the Ocean New Era, which returned to service in December 2005. Mexican GOM. Revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersibles operating in the Mexican GOM during 2006 decreased $5.1 million compared to 2005, primarily due to PEMEXs early cancellation of its contract for the Ocean Whittington in July 2006, partially offset by increased revenues for the Ocean Worker as a result of a small dayrate increase received in December 2005. Our remaining three rigs in this market continue operating under contracts with PEMEX, two of which expire in mid 2007 and one that extends until late 2007. Operating costs in the Mexican GOM increased $3.2 million during 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to the effect of 2005 and March 2006 wage increases for our rig based personnel, as well as higher repair and maintenance costs, other miscellaneous operating costs and overheads, partially offset by lower operating costs for the Ocean Whittington pursuant to its third quarter relocation to the GOM after termination of its drilling contract by PEMEX. In addition, we incurred $1.9 million in costs associated with the demobilization of the Ocean Whittington from offshore Mexico to the GOM. Australia/Asia. Our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the Australia/Asia market during 2006 generated an additional $84.4 million in revenues compared to 2005 primarily due to higher average operating dayrates ($84.3 million). Average operating dayrates increased from $76,300 in 2005 to $135,600 in 2006. In addition, the over 95% utilization of both the Ocean Epoch and Ocean Patriot during 2006, as compared to 2005 when the average utilization for these two rigs was 84%, contributed an additional $6.6 million to 2006 revenues. During 2005 the Ocean Epoch had over two months of downtime associated with a scheduled 5 year survey, other regulatory inspections and contract preparation work prior to its relocation to Malaysia and the Ocean Patriot incurred over one month of downtime associated with an intermediate inspection and repairs. These favorable revenue variances in 2006 were partially offset by the lower recognition of deferred mobilization, capital upgrade and other fees in 2006 compared to 2005. During 2006, we recognized $2.3 million in lump sum mobilization revenue related to the Ocean Patriots move offshore New Zealand at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2006 and equipment upgrade fees from two customers in connection with customer requested capital improvements to the Ocean Patriot. However, during 2005, we recognized $5.7 million and $0.9 million in connection with the Ocean Patriots 2004 mobilization from South Africa to New Zealand and the Bass Strait and equipment upgrade fees, respectively. Additionally, we received a fee from another customer in this market for a drilling option for another rig, of which $0.6 million and $3.7 million were recognized in 2006 and 2005, respectively. 29 Table of Contents Contract drilling expense for the Australia/Asia/Middle East region increased slightly from $83.8 million in 2005 to $87.5 million in 2006. The $3.8 million net increase in costs for 2006 is primarily the result of higher labor costs (due to wage increases in late 2005 and March 2006), higher repair and maintenance costs, higher revenue based agency fees and higher other operating costs. These unfavorable cost trends were partially offset by lower survey and inspection costs in 2006 and the recognition of an insurance deductible in 2005 related to an anchor winch failure on the Ocean Patriot. In addition, we recognized $1.1 million and $5.2 million in mobilization expenses for our rigs in this region during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The amount of mobilization expenses recognized during a period is dependent upon the duration of the rig move and the contract period over which the mobilization costs are to be recognized. Europe/Africa. Revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersibles operating in this market increased $101.0 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in the average operating revenue per day earned by our rigs in this market. Excluding the Ocean Lexington, which began operating in this market sector during the fourth quarter of 2006 and contributed revenues of $5.6 million, the average operating revenue per day for our rigs operating in this market increased from $87,500 in 2005 to $144,500 in 2006. This increase in average revenue per day generated additional revenues of $70.6 million in 2006 compared to 2005. All three of our rigs operating in the U.K. sector of the North Sea received operating dayrate increases during 2006 and the Ocean Vanguard began a drilling program in the fourth quarter of 2006 at a higher dayrate than it previously earned. Average utilization for our rigs in the Europe/Africa region increased from 83% in 2005 to 94% in 2006, excluding the Ocean Lexington, generating $20.7 million in additional revenues. The increase in average utilization is primarily due to higher utilization in 2006 for the Ocean Vanguard, compared to 2005 when this unit incurred more than five months of downtime due to an anchor winch failure and for a 5 year survey and related repairs. Additionally, average utilization for our three rigs operating in the U.K. sector of the North Sea increased slightly, reflecting the nearly full utilization of the Ocean Nomad during 2006 compared to 2005, when the rig was ready stacked for almost three weeks and incurred nearly a full month of downtime for repairs. These favorable utilization trends were partially offset by 48 days of downtime for the Ocean Princess which was in a shipyard for an intermediate survey during 2006. In comparison, the Ocean Princess operated for nearly all of 2005. During 2006, we also recognized $4.4 million in revenues related to the amortization of lump sum fees received from customers for capital improvements to the Ocean Guardian and Ocean Vanguard. Contract drilling expenses for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the Europe/Africa region increased $16.5 million during 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to the inclusion of $4.2 million of normal operating costs for the Ocean Lexington in Egypt and costs associated with scheduled surveys for the Ocean Guardian and Ocean Princess, including mobilization and related repair costs during 2006. Also contributing to the increase in costs during 2006 were higher personnel and related costs (including administrative and support personnel in the region), reflecting the impact of wage increases after September 2005 and higher overall other operating costs. These cost increases in 2006 were partially offset by lower maintenance costs for the Ocean Vanguard in 2006 compared to 2005 and the absence of mobilization costs in 2006 related to the Ocean Nomads relocation from Gabon to the North Sea at the end of 2004, which were fully recognized in 2005, as well as the 2005 recognition of mobilization costs incurred in connection with the Ocean Guardians first quarter 2006 survey. South America. Revenues generated by our two intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in Brazil increased $23.2 million to $76.7 million in 2006 from $53.6 million in 2005, primarily due to higher average operating dayrates earned by both of our rigs in this market. Average operating revenue per day rose from $75,100 in 2005 to $113,700 in 2006, contributing $26.4 million in additional revenues. Reduced utilization for our two intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating offshore Brazil during 2006, compared to 2005, is primarily the result of additional downtime for repairs during 2006, including 45 days of downtime for a thruster change out on the Ocean Yatzy. This overall decrease in average utilization in 2006 resulted in a $3.2 million reduction in revenues compared to the prior year. Operating expenses for the Ocean Yatzy and Ocean Winner increased $11.5 million in 2006 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased labor costs for our rig based and shore based personnel as a result of wage increases and other compensation enhancement programs implemented after the third quarter of 2005, higher 30 Table of Contents revenue based agency fees, as well as higher repair, maintenance and freight costs and increases in other routine operating costs in 2006 compared to 2005.

Revenues generated by our jack up rigs in the GOM increased $92.9 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an improvement in average operating dayrates for our rigs in this region. Excluding the Ocean Warwick, which was declared a constructive total loss in the third quarter of 2005, our average operating revenue per day increased to $100,800 in 2006 from $59,100 in 2005, generating additional revenues of $141.9 million. GOM revenues were reduced $37.2 million due to changes in average utilization which fell to 79% in 2006 from 96% in 2005 (excluding the Ocean Warwick). During 2006, utilization in the GOM was negatively impacted primarily by the relocation of the Ocean Spur to Tunisia in the first quarter of 2006 and over five months of downtime for the Ocean Nugget for a special survey, related repairs and contract preparation work prior to its relocation to the Mexican GOM in the fourth quarter of 2006. Also during 2006, the Ocean Spartan underwent leg repairs and was ready stacked from mid September 2006 until mid December 2006 for total downtime of approximately four months, and the Ocean Summit incurred over three months of downtime for a special survey and related repairs. During 2005, the Ocean Warwick generated revenues of $11.8 million. Contract drilling expense in the GOM during 2006 increased $13.7 million compared to 2005. The increase in 2006 operating costs is primarily due to higher labor and other personnel related costs as a result of late 2005 and March 2006 wage increases, costs associated with special surveys and related repairs for the Ocean Summit and Ocean Nugget, leg repairs for the Ocean Nugget, leg/spud can repairs for the Ocean Spartan and higher overhead, catering and other miscellaneous operating expenses. The overall increase in contract drilling expenses was partially offset by the absence of operating costs for the Ocean Warwick during 2006 and reduced operating costs in the GOM for the Ocean Spur (which only operated in the GOM for 45 days in 2006 before relocating to Tunisia) and the Ocean Nugget (which was relocated to the Mexican GOM at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2006). Both the Ocean Spur and Ocean Nugget operated solely in the GOM during 2005. Also partially offsetting these negative cost trends was a reduction in survey and related mobilization costs during 2006 associated with the Ocean Spartans survey in late 2005. We also recognized a $1.0 million insurance deductible for a leg punchthrough incident on the Ocean Spartan in 2005. Mexican GOM. Our jack up rig the Ocean Nugget, which relocated to the Mexican GOM at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2006, generated $16.0 million there in 2006. This unit is contracted to work for PEMEX through March 2009. Contract drilling expenses related to this rig were $4.4 million. We had no jack up units operating in this market during 2005. 31 Table of Contents Australia/Asia/Middle East. Revenues generated by our jack up rigs in the Australia/Asia and Middle East regions were $61.1 million in 2006 compared to $49.4 million in 2005. The $11.7 million increase in revenues in this region during 2006 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to higher average operating dayrates for both of our jack up rigs in this region ($15.1 million). Average dayrates for our jack up rigs in this region increased from $71,900 in 2005 to $95,600 in 2006. The favorable contribution to operating revenues by the increase in average operating dayrates was partially offset by the reduced recognition of deferred mobilization revenues in 2006, as compared to 2005 ($3.1 million) and the effect of slightly lower average utilization in this region in 2006 compared to 2005 ($0.3 million). Contract drilling expenses for our jack up rigs in the Australia/Asia and Middle East regions increased slightly from $25.0 million in 2005 to $27.7 million in 2006. Higher labor costs in 2006 (resulting from late 2005 and early 2006 wage increases), higher maintenance, inspection costs and revenue based agency fees were partially offset by the 2005 recognition of an insurance deductible for leg damage to the Ocean Heritage and the recognition of mobilization costs related to relocation of the Ocean Sovereign to locations offshore Bangladesh and Indonesia during 2005. Europe/Africa. The Ocean Spur began operating offshore Tunisia in mid March 2006 and generated $42.8 million in revenues, including the recognition of $5.3 million in deferred mobilization revenue, and incurred operating expenses of $14.8 million during 2006. We did not have any of our jack up rigs working in this region during 2005. Other Contract Drilling. Other contract drilling expenses increased $15.4 million during 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to the inclusion of $12.7 million in costs related to anchor boat rental and other costs associated with our mooring enhancement and hurricane preparedness activities, which were implemented in response to mooring issues which arose during the 2005 hurricane season. Reimbursable expenses, net. Revenues related to reimbursable items, offset by the related expenditures for these items, were $8.0 million and $6.4 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Reimbursable expenses include items that we purchase, and or services we perform, at the request of our customers. We charge our customers for purchases and or services performed on their behalf at cost, plus a mark up where applicable. Therefore, net reimbursables fluctuate based on customer requirements, which vary. Depreciation. Depreciation expense increased $16.8 million to $200.5 million during 2006 compared to $183.7 million during the same period in 2005 primarily due to depreciation associated with capital additions in 2005 and 2006, partially offset by lower depreciation expense resulting from the declaration of a constructive total loss of the Ocean Warwick in the third quarter of 2005. General and Administrative Expense. We incurred general and administrative expense of $41.6 million during 2006 compared to $37.2 million during 2005. The $4.4 million increase in overhead costs between the periods was primarily due to the recognition of stock based compensation expense pursuant to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), effective January 1, 2006. Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets. We recognized a net loss of $1.1 million on the sale and disposal of assets, including disposal costs, during 2006 compared to a net gain of $14.8 million during 2005. The loss recognized in 2006 is primarily the result of costs associated with the removal of production equipment from the Ocean Monarch, which was subsequently sold to a third party, partially offset by a $1.1 million recovery from certain of our customers related to the involuntary conversion of assets damaged during the 2005 hurricanes. Results for 2005 included a gain of $8.0 million related to the June 2005 sale of the Ocean Liberator, $5.6 million in insurance proceeds related to the involuntary conversion of certain assets damaged during Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and gains on the sale of used drill pipe during the period, partially offset by a $1.4 million loss due to the retirement of equipment lost or damaged during 32 Table of Contents Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Casualty Gain on Ocean Warwick. We recorded a $33.6 million casualty gain in 2005 as a result of the constructive total loss of the Ocean Warwick, resulting from damages sustained during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. Subsequently in 2006, we revised our estimate of expected deductibles related to this incident and recorded a $0.5 million favorable adjustment to Casualty Gain on Ocean Warwick. See Overview Impact of 2005 Hurricanes. Interest Income. We earned interest income of $37.9 million during 2006 compared to $26.0 million in 2005. The $11.9 million increase in interest income is primarily the result of the combined effect of slightly higher interest rates earned on higher average invested cash balances in 2006, as compared to 2005. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements and Historical Cash Flows. Interest Expense. We recorded interest expense of $24.1 million during 2006, reflecting a $17.7 million decrease in interest cost compared to 2005. The decrease in interest cost was primarily attributable to lower interest expense in 2006 related to our Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures due 2020, or Zero Coupon Debentures, as a result of our June 2005 repurchase of $774.1 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of Zero Coupon Debentures, the associated write off of $6.9 million of debt issuance costs in June 2005 and the conversion of $22.4 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of Zero Coupon Debentures into shares of our common stock during 2006. In addition we capitalized an additional $9.1 million in interest costs in connection with qualifying upgrades and construction projects during 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in interest cost was partially offset by additional interest expense on our 4.875% Senior Notes due July 1, 2015, or 4.875% Senior Notes, which we issued in June 2005. Other Income and Expense (Other, net). Included in Other, net are foreign currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses and other income and expense items, among other things, which are not attributable to our drilling operations. The components of Other, net fluctuate based on the level of activity, as well as fluctuations in foreign currencies. We recorded other income, net, of $12.1 million during 2006 and other expense, net, of $1.1 million in 2005. Effective October 1, 2005, we changed the functional currency of certain of our subsidiaries operating outside the United States to the U.S. dollar to more appropriately reflect the primary economic environment in which these subsidiaries operate. Prior to this date, these subsidiaries utilized the local currency of the country in which they conducted business as their functional currency. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of $10.3 million and net foreign currency exchange losses of $0.8 million, respectively. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, we accounted for foreign currency translation gains and losses as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive losses in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report. Income Tax Expense. Our net income tax expense is a function of the mix of our domestic and international pre tax earnings, as well as the mix of earnings from the international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognized $259.5 million of tax expense on pre tax income of $966.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to tax expense of $96.1 million on a pre tax income of $356.4 million in 2005. Certain of our rigs that operate internationally are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited, a Cayman Islands subsidiary that we wholly own. We do not intend to remit earnings from this subsidiary to the U.S. and we plan to indefinitely reinvest these earnings internationally. Consequently, we provided no U.S. taxes on earnings and recognized no U.S. benefits on losses generated by this subsidiary during 2006 and 2005. 33 Table of Contents During 2006 we were able to utilize all of the foreign tax credits available to us and we had no foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2006. At the end of 2005, we had a valuation allowance of $0.8 million for certain of our foreign tax credit carryforwards which was reversed during 2006 as the valuation allowance was no longer necessary. During 2005, we reversed $9.6 million of the previously established $10.3 million valuation allowance for certain of our foreign tax credit carryforwards. During 2006 we recorded an $8.3 million tax benefit related to the deduction allowable under Internal Revenue Code Section 199 for domestic production activities. During the second quarter of 2006, the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service issued guidelines regarding the deduction allowable under Internal Revenue Code Section 199 which was previously believed to be unavailable to the drilling industry with respect to qualified production activities income. The $8.3 million tax benefit recognized included $2.2 million related to the year 2005. During 2005, we reversed a previously established reserve of $8.9 million ($1.7 million included with Current Taxes Payable and $7.2 million in Other Liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets) associated with exposure related to the disallowance of goodwill deductibility associated with a 1996 acquisition which we believed was no longer necessary. During 2005, we settled an income tax dispute in East Timor (formerly part of Indonesia) for approximately $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, our books reflected an accrued liability of $4.4 million related to potential East Timor and Indonesian income tax liabilities covering the period 1992 through 2000. Subsequent to the tax settlement, we determined that the accrual was no longer necessary and reversed the accrued liability in the fourth quarter of 2005. During 2004 and 2005, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, examined our federal income tax returns for tax years 2000 and 2002. The examination was concluded during the fourth quarter of 2005. We and the IRS agreed to a limited number of adjustments for which we recorded additional income tax of $1.9 million in 2005. 34 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Comparative data relating to our revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are presented below. We have reclassified certain amounts applicable to the prior periods to conform to the classifications we currently follow. These reclassifications do not affect earnings.

Revenues for our high specification floaters in the GOM increased $160.6 million in 2005, primarily due to higher average dayrates earned ($128.0 million) and higher utilization of our fleet in this market ($31.9 million), as compared to 2004. The higher overall dayrates achieved for our high specification floaters reflected the continuing high demand for this class of rig in the GOM. Average dayrates for these rigs increased to $143,800 in 2005 compared to $82,000 in 2004. Fleet utilization for our high specification rigs in the GOM increased to 91% in 2005 from 80% in 2004. Higher utilization in 2005 compared to the prior year reflects the return to drilling operations of several rigs which did not operate in 2004 due to scheduled inspections and repairs (Ocean Confidence and Ocean America) and upgrade projects (Ocean America) and the ready stacking of the Ocean Star for the first five months of 2004. In the late third quarter of 2005, we relocated the Ocean Baroness from the Australia/Asia market to the GOM for a long term contract extending until November 2009. The Ocean Baroness began operating under contract in the GOM in November 2005 and generated revenues of $9.8 million in 2005, which are included in the utilization factors discussed above. Operating costs during 2005 for our high specification floaters in the GOM increased $7.0 million over operating costs in 2004. The increase in operating costs is primarily attributable to higher labor and benefits costs related to higher utilization of our rigs and the effect of December 2004 and September 2005 wage increases. Costs in 2005 also include operating expenses for the Ocean Baroness in the GOM, including mobilization costs from Southeast Asia. Increased operating costs in 2005 were partially offset by our recovery from a customer for damages sustained to one of our high specification rigs during Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Australia/Asia. Revenues generated by our rigs in the Australia/Asia region decreased $12.3 million to $68.3 million in 2005, as compared to revenues of $80.7 million in 2004. Utilization in this region decreased from 95% in 2004 to 80% in 2005, primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean Baroness from this market to the GOM. Prior to its departure to the GOM, the Ocean Baroness was mobilized to a shipyard in Singapore in mid May 2005 for an intermediate inspection and preparation for the rigs dry tow to the GOM, which resulted in additional unpaid downtime for the drilling unit as compared to 2004. The decline in utilization in 2005, as compared to 2004, resulted in a $23.9 million reduction in revenues in 2005. Average operating dayrates in this region increased from $116,600 in 2004 to $141,000 in 2005 and resulted in additional revenues of $11.6 million in 2005 compared to 2004. Contract drilling expenses in the region decreased $4.8 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean Baroness to the GOM in the third quarter of 2005. The overall decline in operating costs in the region was partially offset by higher insurance costs associated with increased premiums for the 2005/2006 policy year and additional loss of hire insurance coverage. 36 Table of Contents South America. Revenues for our high specification rig operations offshore Brazil increased $18.8 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily as a result of increased utilization for the Ocean Alliance in 2005 as compared to the prior year, when this rig experienced approximately five months of unpaid downtime. Utilization for these rigs offshore Brazil increased from 76% in 2004 to 89% in 2005 and contributed $9.5 million in additional revenues. Additionally, we negotiated a contract extension, including a dayrate increase, for the Ocean Alliance in the third quarter of 2005. Average dayrates earned by our high specification rigs in this region increased to $117,300 in 2005 from $102,900 in 2004, which contributed $9.3 million in additional revenues during 2005. Contract drilling expense for these operations in Brazil increased $4.9 million in 2005 compared to the prior year. The increase in costs in 2005 was primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs as a result of December 2004 and September 2005 pay increases, increased local shorebase support costs due to the completion of a local training program in Brazil and higher insurance costs associated with increased premiums for the 2005/2006 policy year and additional loss of hire insurance.

Revenues generated in 2005 by our intermediate semisubmersible fleet operating in the GOM increased $57.1 million due to higher average dayrates earned ($31.3 million) and higher utilization of our fleet in this market ($27.5 million), as compared to 2004. Average dayrates earned increased to $77,300 in 2005 compared to $44,600 in 2004, reflecting the tightening market for intermediate semisubmersibles in the GOM. During 2004, we recognized $1.8 million in lump sum mobilization fees for the Ocean Concord. Overall utilization for our intermediate semisubmersibles in this region (excluding the Ocean Endeavor, which was cold stacked during 2004 prior to commencing a major upgrade in 2005, and the cold stacked Ocean Monarch, which we acquired in August 2005) increased to 71% in 2005 from 50% in 2004. The increase in utilization in 2005, as compared to 2004, is primarily due to the nearly full utilization of the Ocean Voyager in 2005 compared to 2004, when this unit was cold stacked for most of the year, and increased utilization for the Ocean Concord, which was out of service for almost six months in 2004 for a 5 year survey and maintenance projects. Additionally, we reactivated the Ocean New Era from cold stack status in the last half of 2005, and this drilling unit returned to active service in late December 2005. Partially offsetting the overall increase in utilization in 2005, as compared to 2004, was approximately four months of unpaid downtime for the Ocean Lexington in 2005 associated with inspections and a life enhancement project. 37 Table of Contents Contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersibles operations in the GOM increased $12.6 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to higher labor and benefits costs as a result of December 2004 and September 2005 wage increases for our rig based personnel, normal operating costs for the Ocean Voyager and Ocean New Era in 2005 and higher inspection and maintenance project costs for the Ocean Lexington, which was in a shipyard for inspections and a life enhancement project during 2005. These cost increases were partially offset by lower reactivation costs for the Ocean New Era in 2005, as compared to costs incurred to reactivate the Ocean Voyager in 2004. Australia/Asia. Our intermediate semisubmersibles working offshore Australia/Asia generated revenues of $111.8 million in 2005 compared to revenues of $77.2 million in 2004. The $34.6 million increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in average operating dayrates to $76,300 in 2005 compared to $62,900 in 2004, which generated $16.9 million in additional revenues in 2005. Our results in this region in 2005 also reflect the favorable impact of the Ocean Patriot operating for the majority of the year following its relocation to the region in the second half of 2004. However, excluding the Ocean Patriot, our average utilization for these rigs in the Australia/Asia region decreased from 96% in 2004 to 92% in 2005, primarily due to unpaid downtime for the Ocean Epoch which was in a shipyard for approximately 70 days in 2005 for a scheduled 5 year survey and associated repairs. The net effect of changes in utilization in this region was the generation of $10.7 million in additional revenues in 2005 compared to 2004. During 2005 we recognized $5.7 million in lump sum mobilization fees for the Ocean Patriot related to its 2004 mobilization from South Africa to New Zealand and the Bass Strait, compared to $3.3 million in similar fees recognized in 2004. In 2005 we also recognized $3.7 million in revenue related to the extension of a contract option period for one of our rigs in this region and $0.9 million in revenues for the amortization of lump sum fees received from a customer for rig modifications. Contract drilling expense for the Australia/Asia region increased $19.8 million from 2004 to 2005, primarily due to costs associated with the Ocean Patriot operating offshore Australia for all of 2005, including the amortization of deferred mobilization expenses. Europe/Africa. Operating revenues for our intermediate semisubmersibles working in this region increased $37.0 million in 2005 primarily due to an increase in the average operating dayrates from $54,400 in 2004 to $87,500 in 2005. This increase in average operating dayrates contributed $40.6 million in additional revenues in 2005, as compared to 2004. With the exception of the Ocean Patriot, which relocated from this region to Australia in mid 2004, average utilization increased slightly in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to higher utilization of the Ocean Nomad in 2005 as compared to 2004, when this drilling unit was both ready stacked and mobilizing between Africa and the U.K. for a total of approximately five months during the year. The net effect of changes in average utilization between 2005 and 2004 was a $1.9 million decrease in operating revenues in 2005. In 2004, we also recognized $2.0 million in mobilization revenue for the Ocean Nomad. Contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating offshore Europe increased $10.4 million in 2005 primarily due to increased labor and related costs and shorebase support costs for our operations in Norway, mostly due to Norwegian pay allowances and additional personnel required to comply with Norwegian regulations. Normal operating expenses for the Ocean Nomad increased in 2005, as compared to 2004, mainly due to higher labor costs associated with its operations in the U.K., as compared to the prior year when this unit worked a portion of the year offshore western Africa, as well as the recognition of mobilization expenses in 2005 related to the rigs relocation from western Africa to the U.K. Our operating costs in this region in 2004 included $8.7 million in costs for the Ocean Patriot which relocated to the Australia/Asia region in mid 2004. South America. Our intermediate semisubmersibles working in Brazil generated revenues of $53.6 million in 2005 compared to revenues of $44.8 million in 2004. The $8.8 million increase in operating revenues was primarily due to a contract extension for the Ocean Yatzy at a higher average dayrate than it previously earned. Average operating dayrates increased to $75,100, as compared to an average dayrate of $70,300 in 2004, and resulted in additional revenues of $4.3 million in 2005. Average utilization of our rigs in this region increased from 87% in 38 Table of Contents 2004 to 98% in 2005, which resulted in additional revenues in 2005 of $4.5 million. The lower utilization in 2004 was primarily due to additional downtime for special surveys and inspections of both of our rigs in this region. Operating expenses for the Ocean Yatzy and Ocean Winner increased $4.7 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to increased labor costs for our rig based personnel as a result of December 2004 and September 2005 wage increases and higher national labor and local shorebase support costs resulting from completion of a local competency program in Brazil.

Our operating results in this region reflected the improvement in average operating dayrates and utilization for jack up rigs in the GOM during 2005. Average operating dayrates increased to $54,600 in 2005 from $36,300 in 2004, which resulted in additional revenues of $75.5 million in 2005. Utilization of our jack up fleet in the GOM continued to improve in 2005 compared to the average utilization achieved by our rigs in 2004. Average utilization in 2005 increased to 96% from 87% in 2004, resulting in additional revenues of $8.0 million in 2005. The improvement in utilization was primarily due to the nearly full utilization of the Ocean Champion in 2005 as compared to 2004, when it completed its reactivation from cold stacked status, and the full utilization of the Ocean Nugget in 2005, as compared to 60 days of unpaid downtime in 2004 for a spud can inspection and related repair work. In late August 2005, the Ocean Warwick was declared a constructive total loss by our insurers as a result of damage it sustained during Hurricane Katrina. During 2005 and 2004, this drilling rig generated $11.8 million and $9.3 million in revenues, respectively, which are included in the revenue variances discussed above. See Overview Impact of 2005 Hurricanes. Contract drilling expenses for our jack up rigs operating in the GOM increased $9.0 million in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to higher labor and benefits costs for our rig based personnel as a result of December 2004 and September 2005 wage increases, higher normal operating costs in 2005 for the Ocean Champion compared to 2004 when the rig was being reactivated and higher operating and overhead costs for most of our jack ups in this region due to increased utilization. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Revenues for jack up rigs in the Australasian and Middle East regions were $49.4 million in 2005 compared to $21.3 million in 2004. The $28.2 million increase in revenues in this region in 2005 is primarily attributable to revenues generated by the Ocean Heritage ($17.0 million), which worked in this region for the entire year, compared to working in this region during only the last quarter of 2004, and an operating dayrate increase for the Ocean Sovereign ($11.2 million) after its second quarter 2005 relocation within the region to Indonesia. 39 Table of Contents Contract drilling expense for our jack up rigs in the Australasian and Middle East regions increased $9.4 million to $25.0 million in 2005, as compared 2004, primarily due to normal operating costs associated with the Ocean Heritage operating in the region for the entire year, and higher normal repair and maintenance, travel and shore based costs for the Ocean Sovereign. South America. The Ocean Heritage operated offshore Ecuador for almost eight months in 2004. During its contract the rig generated $18.2 million in revenues, including the recognition of $8.5 million in lump sum mobilization fees, and incurred operating expenses of $9.0 million before returning to the Australasia/Middle East region in the fourth quarter of 2004. Other Operating Revenue and Expenses, net. Other operating expenses, net of other revenues, were $8.3 million in 2005 compared to $1.2 million in 2004. The $7.2 million increase in net costs in 2005, as compared to 2004, relates primarily to costs associated with relief and recovery efforts in the aftermath of the 2005 GOM hurricanes, increased rig crew training costs due to higher staffing and recruiting levels in 2005 and higher costs in 2005 to repair and replace non rig specific spare equipment. Reimbursable expenses, net. Revenues related to reimbursable items, offset by the related expenditures for these items, were $6.4 million and $3.4 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Reimbursable expenses include items that we purchase, and or services we perform, at the request of our customers. We charge our customers for purchases and or services performed on their behalf at cost, plus a mark up where applicable. Therefore, net reimbursables fluctuate based on customer requirements, which vary. Depreciation. Depreciation expense increased $4.9 million to $183.7 million in 2005 compared to $178.8 million in 2004 primarily due to depreciation recorded in 2005 associated with capital additions in 2004 and 2005. The increase in depreciation expense attributable to capital additions was partially offset by lower depreciation due to the constructive total loss of the Ocean Warwick in the third quarter of 2005 and the transfer of the Ocean Liberator to assets held for sale in December 2004. General and Administrative Expense. We incurred general and administrative expense of $37.2 million in 2005 compared to $32.8 million in 2004. The $4.4 million increase in overhead costs between the periods was primarily due to higher compensation expense related to our management bonus plan, higher fees paid to our external auditors and higher engineering consulting fees. Partially offsetting these higher expenses were lower legal fees in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to the settlement of litigation in December 2004, and the capitalization of certain costs associated with the upgrade of the Ocean Endeavor, which commenced in 2005. Gain on Sale and Disposition of Assets. We recognized a net gain of $14.8 million on the sale and disposition of assets in 2005 compared to a net loss of $1.6 million in 2004. Net gains recognized in 2005 include an $8.0 million gain on the June 2005 sale of the Ocean Liberator, $5.6 million in insurance proceeds related to the involuntary conversion of certain assets damaged during Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and gains on the sale of used drill pipe during the period. Partially offsetting the net gain in 2005 was a $1.4 million loss due to the retirement of equipment lost or damaged during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The loss on sale of assets in 2004 relates primarily to the retirement of equipment damaged during Hurricane Ivan. Casualty Gain on Ocean Warwick. We recorded a $33.6 million casualty gain in 2005 as a result of the constructive total loss of one of our jack up rigs, the Ocean Warwick, resulting from damages sustained during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. See Overview Impact of 2005 Hurricanes. 40 Table of Contents Interest Income. We earned interest income of $26.0 million in 2005 compared to $12.2 million in 2004. The $13.8 million increase in interest income is primarily the result of the combined effect of slightly higher interest rates earned on higher average cash and investment balances in 2005, as compared to 2004. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements and Historical Cash Flows. Interest Expense. Interest expense for 2005 was $41.8 million, or an $11.5 million increase in interest cost compared to 2004. This increase was primarily attributable to interest related to our 4.875% Senior Notes and our 5.15% Senior Notes Due September 1, 2014, or 5.15% Senior Notes, which we issued in June 2005 and August 2004, respectively. In addition, interest expense for 2005 included a write off of $6.9 million in debt issuance costs associated with our June 2005 repurchase of approximately 96% of our then outstanding Zero Coupon Debentures. This increase in interest cost was partially offset by lower interest expense on our Zero Coupon Debentures subsequent to our partial repurchase of the outstanding debentures in June 2005 and approximately $0.7 million in interest costs which were capitalized in 2005 related to qualifying upgrade and construction projects. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements Contractual Cash Obligations. Other Income and Expense (Other, net). Included in Other, net are foreign currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses and other income and expense items, among other things, which are not attributable to our drilling operations. The components of Other, net fluctuate based on the level of activity, as well as fluctuations in foreign currencies. We recorded other expense, net, of $1.1 million in both 2005 and 2004. Effective October 1, 2005, we changed the functional currency of certain of our subsidiaries operating outside the United States to the U.S. dollar to more appropriately reflect the primary economic environment in which these subsidiaries operate. Prior to this date, these subsidiaries utilized the local currency of the country in which they conduct business as their functional currency. During 2005 and 2004, we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of $0.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively, including $3.5 million in additional expense in 2005 as a result of our change in functional currency to the U.S. dollar. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, we accounted for foreign currency translation gains and losses as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive losses in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report. Income Tax Expense. Our net income tax expense is a function of the mix of our domestic and international pre tax earnings, as well as the mix of earnings from the international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognized $96.1 million of tax expense on pre tax income of $356.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to tax expense of $3.7 million on a pre tax loss of $3.5 million in 2004. Certain of our rigs that operate internationally are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited, a Cayman Islands subsidiary that we wholly own. We do not intend to remit earnings from this subsidiary to the U.S. and we plan to indefinitely reinvest these earnings internationally. Consequently, we provided no U.S. taxes on earnings and recognized no U.S. benefits on losses generated by this subsidiary during 2005 and 2004. At the end of 2004 we had established a valuation allowance of $10.3 million for certain of our foreign tax credit carryforwards which were scheduled to expire beginning in 2011. At December 31, 2005, we had $15.3 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards. During 2005, we were able to utilize most of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income generated during the year. As a result, we expected to be able to utilize $14.5 million of our available foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration dates, and determined that a valuation allowance was no longer necessary for those credits. Consequently, we reversed $9.6 million of the previously established valuation allowance during 2005. With respect to the remaining $0.8 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards, we determined that a valuation allowance was necessary and as a result had a valuation allowance of $0.8 million at December 31, 2005. 41 Table of Contents At December 31, 2004 we had a reserve of $8.9 million ($1.7 million included with Current Taxes Payable and $7.2 in Other Liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets) for the exposure related to the disallowance of goodwill deductibility associated with a 1996 acquisition. During 2005 we concluded that the reserve was no longer necessary and eliminated the reserve, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $8.9 million. During 2005, we settled an income tax dispute in East Timor (formerly part of Indonesia) for approximately $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, our books reflected an accrued liability of $4.4 million related to potential East Timor and Indonesian income tax liabilities covering the period 1992 through 2000. Subsequent to the tax settlement, we determined that the accrual was no longer necessary and wrote off the accrued liability in the fourth quarter of 2005. During 2004 and 2005, the IRS examined our federal income tax returns for tax years 2000 and 2002. The examination was concluded during the fourth quarter of 2005. We and the IRS agreed to a limited number of adjustments for which we recorded additional income tax of $1.9 million in 2005. Our tax expense in 2004 included $2.5 million associated with a revision to estimates in tax balance sheet accounts, a tax benefit of $5.2 million related to goodwill arising from a 1996 merger, and a tax benefit of $4.5 million due to the reversal of a tax liability associated with the Ocean Alliance lease leaseback. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act, or AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA includes a provision allowing a deduction of 85% for certain foreign earnings that are repatriated. The AJCA provided us a potential opportunity to elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in 2005. Based on the language in the AJCA and subsequent guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, and after considering our history of foreign earnings, we did not have undistributed foreign earnings that would qualify for the 85% deduction upon repatriation. Consequently, we did not repatriate any undistributed earnings in 2005 pursuant to the AJCA. 42 Table of Contents Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from our operations, proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and our cash reserves. We may also make use of our $285 million credit facility for cash liquidity. See $285 Million Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2006, we had $524.7 million in Cash and cash equivalents and $301.2 million in Investments and marketable securities, representing our investment of cash available for current operations. Cash Flows from Operations. We operate in an industry that has been, and we expect to continue to be, extremely competitive and highly cyclical. The dayrates we receive for our drilling rigs and rig utilization rates are a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace, which is generally correlated with the price of oil and natural gas. Demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development, a variety of political and economic factors and availability of rigs in a particular geographic region. As utilization rates increase, dayrates tend to increase as well reflecting the lower supply of available rigs, and vice versa. These factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict. For a description of other factors that could affect our cash flows from operations, see Overview Industry Conditions, Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. $285 Million Revolving Credit Facility. In November 2006, we entered into a $285 million syndicated, 5 year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility, for general corporate purposes, including loans and performance or standby letters of credit. Loans under the Credit Facility bear interest at our option at a rate per annum equal to (i) the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin, varying from 0.20% to 0.525%, based on our current credit ratings. Under our Credit Facility, we also pay, based on our current credit ratings, and as applicable, other customary fees, including, but not limited to, a facility fee on the total commitment under the Credit Facility regardless of usage and a utilization fee that applies if the aggregate of all loans outstanding under the Credit Facility equals or exceeds 50% of the total commitment under the facility. Changes in credit ratings could lower or raise the fees that we pay under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, the maintenance of a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization, as defined in the Credit Facility, of not more than 60% at the end of each fiscal quarter and limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations, liquidation and dissolution, changes in lines of business, swap agreements, transactions with affiliates and subsidiary indebtedness. Based on our current credit ratings at December 31, 2006, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans would have been 0.27%. As of December 31, 2006, there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility. Shelf Registration. We have the ability to issue an aggregate of approximately $117.5 million in debt, equity and other securities under a shelf registration statement. In addition, from time to time we may issue up to eight million shares of common stock which are registered under an acquisition shelf registration statement, after giving effect to the two for one stock split we declared in July 1997, in connection with one or more acquisitions by us of securities or assets of other businesses. Liquidity and Capital Requirements Our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements. We determine the amount of cash required to meet our capital commitments by evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, including water depth and drilling capability upgrades. We believe that our operating cash flows and cash reserves will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments; however, we will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions. In addition, we may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. Our ability to effect any such issuance will be dependent on our results of operations, our current financial condition, current market conditions and other 43 Table of Contents factors beyond our control. Additionally, we may also make use of our Credit Facility to finance capital expenditures or for other general corporate purposes. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our business requirements in the foreseeable future, including capital expenditures for rig upgrades and enhancements, as well as our working capital requirements. Contractual Cash Obligations. The following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2006. Payments Due By Period Less than 1 After 5 Contractual Obligations Total year 1 3 years 4 5 years years (In thousands) Long term debt (principal and interest) (1) $ 1,177,056 $ 31,963 $ 513,542 $ 56,098 $ 575,453 Forward exchange contracts 22,463 22,463 Purchase obligations related to rig upgrade/modifications 456,022 263,213 192,809 Operating leases 3,227 2,460 767 Total obligations $ 1,658,768 $ 320,099 $ 707,118 $ 56,098 $ 575,453 (1) See 1.5% Debentures and Zero Coupon Debentures and Note 18 Subsequent Events to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of changes in our long term debt subsequent to December 31, 2006. Payments of our long term debt, including interest, could be accelerated due to certain rights that holders of our debentures have to put the securities to us. See the discussion below related to our 1.5% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2031, or 1.5% Debentures, and Zero Coupon Debentures. As of December 31, 2006, we had purchase obligations aggregating approximately $456 million related to the major upgrades of the Ocean Endeavor and Ocean Monarch and construction of two new jack up rigs, the Ocean Scepter and Ocean Shield. We anticipate that expenditures related to these shipyard projects will be approximately $263 million and $193 million in 2007 and 2008, respectively. However, the actual timing of these expenditures will vary based on the completion of various construction milestones, which are beyond our control. We had no other purchase obligations for major rig upgrades or any other significant obligations at December 31, 2006, except for those related to our direct rig operations, which arise during the normal course of business. 4.875% Senior Notes. On June 14, 2005, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes at an offering price of 99.785% of the principal amount, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $247.6 million. These notes bear interest at 4.875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year and mature on July 1, 2015. The 4.875% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. We have the right to redeem all or a portion of the 4.875% Senior Notes for cash at any time or from time to time on at least 15 days but not more than 60 days prior written notice, at the redemption price specified in the governing indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. 5.15% Senior Notes. On August 27, 2004, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.15% Senior Notes at an offering price of 99.759% of the principal amount, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $247.6 million. These notes bear interest at 5.15% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year and mature on September 1, 2014. The 5.15% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. We have the right to redeem all or a portion of the 5.15% Senior Notes for cash at any time or from time to time on at least 15 days but not more than 60 days prior written notice, at the redemption price specified in the governing indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. 44 Table of Contents 1.5% Debentures. On April 11, 2001, we issued $460.0 million principal amount of 1.5% Debentures, which are due April 15, 2031. The 1.5% Debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 20.3978 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures, or $49.02 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we have the right to deliver cash in lieu of shares of our common stock. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their 1.5% Debentures on April 15, 2008, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. See 1.5% Debentures in Note 8 Long Term Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The 1.5% Debentures are senior unsecured obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. During 2006 and 2005, the holders of $20,000 and $13,000, respectively, in principal amount of our 1.5% Debentures elected to convert their outstanding debentures into shares of our common stock, resulting in the issuance of 404 shares and 264 shares of our common stock in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2006 and through February 14, 2007, the holders of $438.4 million in principal amount of our 1.5% Debentures converted their outstanding debentures into 8,943,284 shares of our common stock. As a result of these conversions, $21.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures remained outstanding as of February 14, 2007. The cash requirements for the interest payable to holders of our 1.5% Debentures will decrease due to the decrease in the outstanding principal amount. Zero Coupon Debentures. We issued our Zero Coupon Debentures on June 6, 2000 at a price of $499.60 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which represents a yield to maturity of 3.50% per year. The Zero Coupon Debentures mature on June 6, 2020, and, as of December 31, 2006, the aggregate accreted value of our outstanding Zero Coupon Debentures was $5.3 million. We will not pay interest prior to maturity unless we elect to convert the Zero Coupon Debentures to interest bearing debentures upon the occurrence of certain tax events. The Zero Coupon Debentures are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into our common stock at a fixed conversion rate of 8.6075 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of Zero Coupon Debentures, subject to adjustments in certain events. See Zero Coupon Debentures in Note 8 Long Term Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The Zero Coupon Debentures are senior unsecured obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. On June 7, 2005, we repurchased $460.0 million accreted value, or $774.1 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity, of our Zero Coupon Debentures at a purchase price of $594.25 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which represented 96% of our then outstanding Zero Coupon Debentures. Additionally, in connection with the June 2005 repurchase, we expensed $6.9 million in debt issuance costs associated with the retired debentures, which we have included in interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. During 2006, holders of $13.7 million accreted value, or $22.4 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity, of our Zero Coupon Debentures elected to convert their outstanding debentures into shares of our common stock. We issued 193,147 shares of our common stock upon conversion of these debentures. Subsequent to December 31, 2006 and through February 14, 2007, the holders of $1.5 million accreted value at the dates of conversion, or $2.4 million aggregate principal amount at maturity, of our Zero Coupon Debentures converted their outstanding debentures into 20,658 shares of our common stock. As a result of these conversions, $3.8 million in accreted value, or $6.0 million aggregate principal amount at maturity, of the Zero Coupon Debentures remained outstanding as of February 14, 2007. Letters of Credit. We are contingently liable as of December 31, 2006 in the amount of $122.0 million under certain performance, bid, supersedeas and custom bonds and letters of credit. We purchased three of these performance bonds totaling $73.2 million from a related party after obtaining competitive quotes. Agreements relating to approximately $107.3 45 Table of Contents million of performance bonds can require collateral at any time. As of December 31, 2006, we had not been required to make any collateral deposits with respect to these agreements. The remaining agreements cannot require collateral except in events of default. On our behalf, banks have issued letters of credit securing certain of these bonds. See Note 12 Related Party Transactions to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. Credit Ratings. Our current credit rating is Baa2 for Moodys Investors Services and A for Standard Poors. Although our long term ratings continue at investment grade levels, lower ratings would result in higher rates for borrowings under our Credit Facility and could also result in higher interest rates on future debt issuances. Capital Expenditures. In 2006, we began a major upgrade of the Ocean Monarch, a Victory class semisubmersible that we acquired in August 2005 for $20.0 million. The modernized rig will be designed to operate in up to 10,000 feet of water in a moored configuration for an estimated cost of approximately $300 million of which we had spent $33.9 million through December 31, 2006. We expect to spend an additional $150.0 million and $116.1 million on this upgrade in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In addition, the shipyard portion of the upgrade of the Ocean Endeavor has been completed. The newly upgraded rig is currently undergoing sea trials and commissioning. The unit will remain in Singapore until the arrival of a heavy lift vessel, anticipated late in the first quarter of 2007, which will return the rig to the GOM. The Ocean Endeavor is expected to commence drilling operations in the GOM in mid 2007. We estimate that the total cost of the upgrade will be approximately $253 million of which $208.4 million had been spent through December 31, 2006. We expect to spend the remaining $44.0 million in 2007. In the second quarter of 2005, we entered into agreements to construct two high performance, premium jack up rigs. The two new drilling units, the Ocean Scepter and the Ocean Shield, are being constructed in Brownsville, Texas and Singapore, respectively, at an aggregate expected cost of approximately $320 million, including drill pipe and capitalized interest, of which $176.1 million had been spent through December 31, 2006. Each newbuild jack up rig will be equipped with a 70 foot cantilever package, be capable of drilling depths of up to 35,000 feet and have a hook load capacity of two million pounds. We expect to spend approximately $69 million and $77 million towards the construction of these two units in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Delivery of both the Ocean Scepter and Ocean Shield are expected in the first quarter of 2008. We have budgeted approximately $316 million in additional capital expenditures in 2007 associated with our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, and other corporate requirements. We expect to finance our 2007 capital expenditures through the use of our existing cash balances or internally generated funds. From time to time, however, we may also make use of our Credit Facility to finance capital expenditures. During 2006, we spent approximately $273.2 million on our continuing rig capital maintenance program (other than rig upgrades and new construction) and to meet other corporate capital expenditure requirements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had no off balance sheet debt or other arrangements. Historical Cash Flows The following is a discussion of our historical cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. 46 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change (In thousands) Net income $ 706,847 $ 260,337 $ 446,510 Net changes in operating assets and liabilities (154,068 ) (84,906 ) (69,162 ) Loss on sale of marketable securities 31 1,180 (1,149 ) Depreciation and other non cash items, net 207,279 211,960 (4,681 ) $ 760,089 $ 388,571 $ 371,518 Our cash flows from operations in 2006 increased $371.5 million or 96% over net cash generated by our operating activities in 2005. The increase in cash flow from operations in 2006 is primarily the result of higher average dayrates and, to a lesser extent, higher utilization earned by our offshore drilling units as a result of an increase in worldwide demand for offshore contract drilling services in 2006 as compared to 2005. These favorable trends were impacted by an increase in cash required to satisfy our working capital requirements, including an increase in our trade accounts receivable, which is primarily driven by higher dayrates earned by our drilling rigs in 2006 as compared to 2005. These trade receivables generate cash as the billing cycle is completed, customarily within 30 to 45 days of invoicing. In addition, we paid $248.7 million and $10.8 million in U.S. federal and foreign income taxes, respectively, each net of refunds received, during 2006. We received $7.7 million in refunds of U.S. federal income taxes and paid $5.3 million in foreign income taxes, net of refunds received, during 2005. Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change (In thousands) Purchase of marketable securities $ (2,472,431 ) $ (4,956,560 ) $ 2,484,129 Proceeds from sale of marketable securities 2,187,766 5,610,907 (3,423,141 ) Capital expenditures (551,237 ) (293,829 ) (257,408 ) Insurance proceeds from casualty loss of Ocean Warwick 50,500 (50,500 ) Proceeds from sale/involuntary conversion of assets 4,731 26,047 (21,316 ) Proceeds from maturities of Australian dollar time deposits 11,761 (11,761 ) Proceeds from settlement of forward contracts 7,289 1,136 6,153 $ (823,882 ) $ 449,962 $ (1,273,844 ) Our investing activities used $823.9 million in 2006, as compared to generating $450.0 million in 2005. During 2006, we purchased marketable securities, net of sales, of $284.7 million compared to net sales of $654.3 million during 2005. Our level of investment activity is dependent on our working capital and other capital requirements during the year, as well as a response to actual or anticipated events or conditions in the securities markets. The high level of marketable securities transactions during 2005, primarily during the first half of the year, was primarily in response to an increase in our short term cash requirements in 2005 to partially fund the repurchase of $460.0 million accreted value of Zero Coupon Debentures in June 2005 and capital additions. During 2006, we spent approximately $278.0 million related to the major upgrades of the Ocean Endeavor and Ocean Monarch and construction of the Ocean Scepter and Ocean Shield. During 2005, we spent approximately $140.4 million related to the major upgrade of the Ocean Endeavor and construction of our two new jack up drilling rigs. Expenditures for our ongoing capital maintenance programs were $273.2 million in 2006 compared to $133.4 million in 2005. The increase in expenditures related to our ongoing capital maintenance program in 2006 compared to 2005 is related to an increase in discretionary funds available for capital spending in 2006, and, to a lesser extent, in response to the high sustained utilization of our drilling rigs in 2006. Our capital expenditures in 2005 also included $20.0 million for the purchase of the Ocean Monarch and its related equipment. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures. 47 Table of Contents We collected $50.5 million in insurance proceeds related to the casualty loss of the Ocean Warwick in 2005. Additionally, in 2005 we sold one of our then cold stacked intermediate semisubmersible rigs, the Ocean Liberator, for net cash proceeds of $13.6 million and received $5.6 million in insurance proceeds (total proceeds of $14.5 million of which $8.9 million is included in net cash provided by operating activities) related to the involuntary conversion of assets damaged during Hurricane Ivan in 2004. During 2006, we received $2.1 million in insurance proceeds (total proceeds of $10.8 million of which $8.7 million is included in net cash provided by operating activities) related to the involuntary conversion of riser equipment damaged on the Ocean Vanguard in December 2004 and recovered an additional $1.1 million from our customers (total recovery of $3.1 million of which $2.0 million is included in net cash provided by operating activities) related to the involuntary conversion of assets damaged during the 2005 hurricanes. During 2005, our remaining investments in Australian dollar time deposits, which we originally entered into in 2004, matured, resulting in proceeds to us of $11.8 million. In the latter half of 2005, we stepped up our ongoing program of entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce our forward exchange risk. During 2006, we realized net gains totaling $7.3 million on the settlement of several forward exchange contracts in various currencies. We realized net gains of $1.1 million on similar forward exchange transactions during 2005. As of December 31, 2006, we had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding, which aggregated $22.5 million, that require us to purchase the equivalent of $5.7 million in Brazilian reais, $2.7 million in British pounds sterling, $10.3 million in Mexican pesos and $3.8 million in Norwegian kroner at various times through June 2007. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change (In thousands) Proceeds from issuance of senior notes $ $ 249,462 $ (249,462 ) Payment of debt issuance costs (1,866 ) 1,866 Redemption of Zero Coupon Debentures (460,015 ) 460,015 Payment of dividends (258,155 ) (48,260 ) (209,895 ) Ocean Alliance lease leaseback agreement (12,818 ) 12,818 Proceeds from stock options exercised 3,263 11,547 (8,284 ) Other 793 793 $ (254,099 ) $ (261,950 ) $ 7,851 In June 2005, we issued $250.0 million principal amount of our 4.875% Senior Notes for net cash proceeds of $247.6 million. We repurchased $460.0 million accreted value, or approximately 96%, of our then outstanding Zero Coupon Debentures for cash in June 2005. We did not issue debt or repurchase any outstanding debentures during 2006. During 2006, we paid cash dividends totaling $258.2 million (consisting of quarterly dividends of $64.6 million in the aggregate, or $0.125 per share of our common stock per quarter, and a special cash dividend of $1.50 per share of our common stock, totaling $193.6 million). We paid $48.3 million in quarterly cash dividends to our shareholders during 2005. Our quarterly dividend payments in the last half of 2005 reflected a $.0625 per share increase over dividends paid during the first half of 2005. On January 30, 2007, we declared a quarterly cash dividend and a special cash dividend of $0.125 and $4.00, respectively, per share of our common stock. Both the quarterly and special cash dividends are payable on March 1, 2007 to stockholders of record on February 14, 2007. Any future determination as to payment of quarterly dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors. In addition, our Board of Directors may, in subsequent years, consider paying additional annual special dividends, in amounts to be determined, if it believes that our financial position, earnings outlook, capital spending plans and other relevant factors warrant such action at that time. 48 Table of Contents Depending on market conditions, we may, from time to time, purchase shares of our common stock in the open market or otherwise. We did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. We paid the final installment of $12.8 million on our lease leaseback arrangement for the Ocean Alliance in December 2005. Other Currency Risk. Some of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their operations in the local currency of the country where they conduct operations. Currency environments in which we have significant business operations include Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Australia and Malaysia. When possible, we attempt to minimize our currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to our estimated operating costs payable in local currency with the balance of the contract payable in U.S. dollars. At present, however, only a limited number of our contracts are payable both in U.S. dollars and the local currency. We also utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce our forward exchange risk. A forward currency exchange contract obligates a contract holder to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specific dates. We record currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses as Other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The effect on our results of operations from these translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses has not been material and are not expected to have a significant effect in the future. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, or SAB 108. SAB 108 requires a registrant to quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements on its current year financial statements using two approaches, the rollover and iron curtain approaches. A registrant is required to adjust its current year financial statements if either approach to accumulate and identify misstatements results in quantifying a misstatement that is material, after considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 is required to be considered for financial statements for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006; however, earlier application of the guidance in SAB 108 to interim financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006 is encouraged. The adoption of SAB 108 had no impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension or Other Postretirement Plans, or SFAS 158. SFAS 158 amends existing guidance to require (1) balance sheet recognition of the funded status of defined benefit plans, (2) recognition in other comprehensive income of various items before they are recognized in periodic benefit cost, (3) the measurement date for plan assets and the benefit obligation to be the balance sheet date, and (4) additional disclosures regarding the effects on periodic benefit cost for the following fiscal year arising from delayed recognition in the current period. SFAS 158 also includes guidance regarding selection of assumed discount rates for use in measuring the benefit obligation. SFAS 158 provides different effective dates for various aspects of the new rules. For public companies, requirements to recognize the funded status of the plan and to comply with the disclosure provisions of SFAS 158 are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006, and the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. Early adoption of SFAS 158 is encouraged and must be applied to all of an entitys benefit plans. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we adopted the requirement to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan, as well as the disclosure provisions. See Note 14 Employee Benefit Plans to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, or SFAS 157, which establishes a separate framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 was issued to eliminate the diversity in practice that exists due to the different definitions of fair value and the limited guidance for applying those definitions in GAAP that are dispersed among the many accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements; however, its adoption may result in changes to current practice. 49 Table of Contents Changes resulting from the application of SFAS 157 relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement, rather than an entity specific measurement. It also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (i) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources and (ii) the reporting entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is encouraged, provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year, including interim periods. We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of applying SFAS 157 on our financial statements; however, we do not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the guidance provided in FIN 48 and expect to adopt FIN 48 in the first quarter of 2007. Although our assessment has not yet been finalized, upon adoption of FIN 48 we expect to recognize a cumulative effect adjustment for uncertain tax positions of approximately $30 million, which will be charged to results of operations and equity. Forward Looking Statements We or our representatives may, from time to time, make or incorporate by reference certain written or oral statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.

These types of statements inherently are subject to a variety of assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected, projected or expressed in forward looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, among others, the following: general economic and business conditions; worldwide demand for oil and natural gas; changes in foreign and domestic oil and gas exploration, development and production activity; oil and natural gas price fluctuations and related market expectations; the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and pricing, and the level of production in non OPEC countries; policies of the various governments regarding exploration and development of oil and gas reserves; advances in exploration and development technology; the political environment of oil producing regions; casualty losses; operating hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore; industry fleet capacity; market conditions in the offshore contract drilling industry, including dayrates and utilization levels; competition; changes in foreign, political, social and economic conditions; risks of international operations, compliance with foreign laws and taxation policies and expropriation or nationalization of equipment and assets; risks of potential contractual liabilities pursuant to our various drilling contracts in effect from time to time; foreign exchange and currency fluctuations and regulations, and the inability to repatriate income or capital; risks of war, military operations, other armed hostilities, terrorist acts and embargoes; changes in offshore drilling technology, which could require significant capital expenditures in order to maintain competitiveness; regulatory initiatives and compliance with governmental regulations; compliance with environmental laws and regulations; customer preferences; effects of litigation; cost, availability and adequacy of insurance; adequacy of our sources of liquidity; the availability of qualified personnel to operate and service our drilling rigs; and various other matters, many of which are beyond our control. The risks and uncertainties included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report and our other filings with the SEC include additional factors that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial performance. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. Forward looking statements included in this report speak only as of the date of this report. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations with regard to the statement or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward looking statement is based. 51 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The information included in this Item 7A is considered to constitute forward looking statements for purposes of the statutory safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements in Item 7 of this report. Our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments. Market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. We believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur. Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by our senior management. Senior management approves the overall investment strategy that we employ and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to us. We may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. Our investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities. We monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates. The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity. The analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period. The sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly, the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our earnings or stockholders equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Our long term debt, as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates, and as such, interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of $270.8 million and $173.8 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A 100 basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of $33.0 million and $40.0 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 52 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. During 2006 and 2005, we entered into various foreign currency forward exchange contracts that required us to purchase predetermined amounts of foreign currencies at predetermined dates. As of December 31, 2006, we had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding, which aggregated $22.5 million, that require us to purchase the equivalent of $5.7 million in Brazilian reais, $2.7 million in British pounds sterling, $10.3 million in Mexican pesos and $3.8 million in Norwegian kroner at various times through June 2007. At December 31, 2005, we had foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding, which aggregated $122.5 million, that required us to purchase the equivalent of $17.1 million in Mexican pesos, the equivalent of $7.7 million in Australian dollars, the equivalent of $67.2 million in British pounds sterling and the equivalent of $30.5 million in Brazilian reais at various times through March 2007. These forward exchange contracts were included in Prepaid expenses and other in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006 and 2005 at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their levels at December 31, 2006 and 2005. The following table presents our exposure to market risk by category (interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates): Fair Value Asset (Liability) Market Risk December 31, December 31, 2006 2005 2006 2005 (In thousands) Interest rate: Marketable securities $ 301,159 (a) $ 2,281 (a) $ 400 (c) $ 200 (c) Long term debt (1,231,689 ) (b) (1,159,941 ) (b) Foreign Exchange: Forward exchange contracts 2,600 (d) 400 (d) 7,400 (d) 21,500 (d) (a) The fair market value of our investment in marketable securities, excluding repurchase agreements, is based on the quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2006 and 2005. (b) The fair values of our 4.875% Senior Notes, 5.15% Senior Notes, 1.5% Debentures and Zero Coupon Debentures are based on the quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2006 and 2005. (c) The calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points at December 31, 2006 and 2005. (d) The calculation of estimated foreign exchange risk is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of an increase in foreign exchange rates of 20% at December 31, 2006 and a decrease in foreign exchange rates of 20% at December 31, 2005. 53 Table of Contents
