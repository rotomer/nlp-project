Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements (including the Notes thereto) in Item 8 of this report. We provide contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe and are a leader in offshore drilling with a fleet of 44 offshore drilling rigs. Our fleet currently consists of 30 semisubmersibles, 13 jack ups and one drillship. In addition, we have two jack up drilling units under construction at shipyards in Brownsville, Texas and Singapore. We expect both of these units to be delivered during the second quarter of 2008. Overview Industry Conditions Worldwide demand for our mid water (intermediate) and deepwater (high specification) semisubmersible rigs remained strong throughout the year 2007 and into 2008. The jack up market in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, however, continues to experience reduced demand, resulting in downward pricing pressure and some of our jack up rigs being ready stacked for periods of time between wells. Exclusive of the GOM jack up market, which accounted for nine percent of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007, solid fundamental market conditions remain in place for all classes of our offshore drilling rigs worldwide. Gulf of Mexico. In the GOM, the market for our high specification semisubmersible equipment remains firm. One of our high specification rigs is contracted for work in the GOM until late in the fourth quarter of 2008, while the remaining seven high specification rigs currently located in the GOM have contracts that extend well into 2009 and beyond, including two at dayrates as high as $500,000 for future work. In many cases, these contracts also include un priced option periods that have neither been exercised nor have expired. As of the date of this report, dayrates for intermediate semisubmersibles in the GOM, where we currently have one such unit operating, are ranging between $250,000 and $300,000. During 2007, strong international demand offering lengthy terms encouraged us to obtain international contracts for four of our intermediate rigs that were previously located in the GOM. All but one of these rigs has left the GOM. The fourth unit is in a shipyard in Brownsville for a survey and life extension project. We expect this rig to depart the GOM in the second quarter of 2008 for Brazil. We continue to view the deepwater and intermediate markets in the GOM as under supplied and believe that the GOM semisubmersible market will remain strong in 2008. Our jack up fleet in the GOM continued to experience lower utilization and dayrates during the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to the third quarter of 2007, as four of our seven available rigs were ready stacked for periods of time and average dayrates declined slightly from those earned during the third quarter of 2007. As of January 28, 2008, all seven of our available jack ups in the GOM were on contract, although the well to well nature of the market persists. The international market for jack ups remains generally strong. As a result, we signed a two year term extension with KODECO Energy Co. LTD. for the Ocean Sovereign in Indonesia at a dayrate in the mid $140,000s that is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2008. The mobilization of the Ocean Columbia from the GOM to Mexico also was completed during the fourth quarter of 2007, and that unit began operating in the first quarter of 2008. We believe that the current market environment for jack up rigs, both in the GOM and internationally, will continue at least through the first quarter of 2008. Brazil. During 2007, we added two semisubmersible rigs to our fleet in Brazil, where we currently have five semisubmersibles and one drillship operating. Two additional semisubmersible units, the Ocean Yorktown and Ocean Worker, are expected to commence operations there in the second and third quarters of 2008, respectively. Our drillship is contracted until the end of 2010. Of our other seven rigs that are or are expected to be working offshore Brazil in 2008, one is contracted until 2012 and two each are contracted until 2013, 2014 and 2015. In late 2007, Petrobras announced the discovery of an ultra deep Atlantic Ocean field with as much as 8 billion barrels of crude oil. In early 2008, Petrobras also announced the discovery of a large natural gas reserve off the coast of Rio de Janeiro that may more than equal the size of the crude oil discovery. We expect the Brazilian floater market to remain strong during 2008. 20 Table of Contents North Sea. Effective semisubmersible utilization remains at 100 percent in the North Sea where we have three semisubmersible rigs in the U.K. and one semisubmersible unit in Norway. The current contract for one of our four rigs in the North Sea extends until the second quarter of 2009, and the other three rigs have term contracts that extend into 2010. Australia/Asia/Middle East/Mediterranean. We currently have five semisubmersible rigs and one jack up unit operating in the Australia/Asia market, and three jack up rigs and one semisubmersible rig located in the Middle East/Mediterranean sector. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the semisubmersible Ocean General received a Letter of Intent, or LOI, for two years of work in Vietnam at a dayrate in the low $280,000s. We believe that the Australia/Asia/Middle East and Mediterranean floater markets will remain strong during 2008. Contract Drilling Backlog The following table reflects our contract drilling backlog as of February 7, 2008, October 25, 2007 (the date reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2007) and February 19, 2007 (the date reported in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2006) and reflects both firm commitments (typically represented by signed contracts), as well as previously disclosed LOIs. An LOI is subject to customary conditions, including the execution of a definitive agreement. Contract drilling backlog is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period and adding one half of any potential rig performance bonuses. Our calculation also assumes full utilization of our drilling equipment for the contract period (excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days); however, the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors. Utilization rates, which generally approach 95 98% during contracted periods, can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including, but not limited to, weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance. Contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and customer reimbursables. Changes in our contract drilling backlog between periods is a function of both the performance of work on term contracts, as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts.

The percentage of rig days committed is calculated as the ratio of total days committed under contracts and LOIs, as well as scheduled shipyard, survey and mobilization days for all rigs in our fleet to total available days (number of rigs multiplied by the number of days in a particular year). Total available days have been calculated based on the expected delivery dates for the Ocean Monarch, and our two new build jack up rigs, the Ocean Scepter and Ocean Shield. For the Years Ending December 31, 2008 2009 2010 2011 2015 Rig Days Committed (1) High Specification Floaters 99 % 73 % 51 % 14 % Intermediate Semisubmersibles 94 % 83 % 53 % 19 % Jack ups 48 % 17 % 2 % (1) Includes approximately 1,166 and 349 scheduled shipyard, survey and mobilization days for 2008 and 2009, respectively. General Our revenues vary based upon demand, which affects the number of days our fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned. When a rig is idle, no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result. Revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs, required surveys and shipyard upgrades. In order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates, we may mobilize our rigs from one market to another. However, during periods of mobilization, revenues may be adversely affected. As a response to changes in demand, we may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously, which may decrease or increase revenues, respectively. The two most significant variables affecting revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates, each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace. As utilization rates increase, dayrates tend to increase as well, reflecting the lower supply of available rigs, and vice versa. Demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development, as well as a variety of political and economic factors. The availability of rigs in a particular geographical region also affects both dayrates and utilization rates. These factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict. We recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed. In connection with such drilling contracts, we may receive fees (either lump sum or dayrate) for the mobilization of equipment. We earn these fees as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. We defer mobilization fees received, as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred, and amortize each, on a straight line basis, over the term of the related drilling contracts (which is the period estimated to be benefited from the mobilization activity). Straight line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts (which generally range from two to 60 months) is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed. Absent a contract, mobilization costs are recognized currently. From time to time, we may receive fees from our customers for capital improvements to our rigs. We defer such fees and recognize them into income on a straight line basis over the period of the related drilling contract as a component of contract drilling revenue. We capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of the improvement. We receive reimbursements for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services and other services provided at the request of our customers in accordance with a contract or agreement. We record these reimbursements at the gross amount billed to the customer, as Revenues related to reimbursable expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in Item 8 of this report. Operating Income. Our operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors, but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses. Our operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling equipment. The principal components of our operating costs are, among other things, direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory inspections, boat and helicopter rentals and insurance. Labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most 22 Table of Contents significant components of our operating expenses. In general, our labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels, rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which our rigs operate. We have experienced and continue to experience upward pressure on salaries and wages as a result of the strong offshore drilling market and increased competition for skilled workers. In response to these market conditions we have implemented retention programs, including increases in compensation. Costs to repair and maintain our equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing, as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the regions in which our rigs are working. Operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates, and short term reductions in utilization do not necessarily result in lower operating expenses. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or ready stacked state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract. However, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, we may reduce the size of a rigs crew and take steps to cold stack the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income. We recognize, as incurred, operating expenses related to activities such as inspections, painting projects and routine overhauls that meet certain criteria and which maintain rather than upgrade our rigs. These expenses vary from period to period. Costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements. Higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades. Periods of high, sustained utilization may result in cost increases for maintenance and repairs in order to maintain our equipment in proper, working order. In addition, during periods of high activity and dayrates, higher prices generally pervade the entire offshore drilling industry and its support businesses, which cause our costs for goods and services to increase. Our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections, which we refer to as a 5 year survey, or special survey, that are due every five years for each of our rigs. Operating revenue decreases because these surveys are performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard. Operating expenses increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs. Repair and maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of rigs undergoing a 5 year survey will vary from year to year. In addition, operating income may be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim periods between 5 year surveys. Intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a 5 year survey. Although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the drilling rig, it normally does not require dry docking or shipyard time, except for rigs located in the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. During 2008, we expect 12 rigs in our fleet to undergo 5 year or intermediate surveys at an estimated aggregate cost of approximately $45 million, including estimated mobilization costs, but excluding any resulting repair and maintenance costs, which could be significant. Costs of mobilizing our rigs to shipyards for scheduled surveys, which were a major component of our survey related costs during 2007, are indicative of higher prices commanded by support businesses to the offshore drilling industry. We expect mobilization costs to be a significant component of our survey related costs in 2008. For physical damage due to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as of the date of this report our deductible is $75.0 million per occurrence (or lower for some rigs if they are declared a constructive total loss) with an annual aggregate limit of $125.0 million. Accordingly, our insurance coverage for all physical damage to our rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for the policy period ending April 30, 2008 is limited to $125.0 million. If named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico cause significant damage to our rigs or equipment or to the property of others for which we may be liable, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Insurance premiums will be amortized as expense over the applicable policy periods which generally expire at the end of April 2008. 23 Table of Contents Construction and Capital Upgrade Projects. We capitalize interest cost for the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost, or SFAS 34. During 2005 and 2006, we began capitalizing interest with respect to expenditures related to our upgrade of the Ocean Monarch and the construction of our two new jack up rigs. Pursuant to SFAS 34, the period of interest capitalization covers the duration of the activities required to make the asset ready for its intended use, and the capitalization period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Prior to the completion of our upgrade of the Ocean Endeavor in March 2007, we capitalized interest on qualifying expenditures on that project beginning in April 2005. See Note 1 General Information Capitalized Interest to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. During 2008, we expect to complete the upgrade of the Ocean Monarch and to accept delivery of the newly constructed Ocean Scepter and Ocean Shield. We will continue to capitalize interest costs related to this upgrade until sea trials and commissioning of the Ocean Monarch are completed and the rig is loaded on a heavy lift vessel for its return to the GOM, which we anticipate will occur late in the fourth quarter of 2008. We expect to continue capitalizing interest costs in connection with the construction of our two jack up rigs until sea trials and commissioning of the rigs are complete, which we expect to occur in the second quarter of 2008. Accordingly, we will then cease capitalizing interest costs related to these projects and will begin depreciating the newly upgraded/constructed rigs. As a result of the scheduled delivery of these rigs, we anticipate that depreciation and interest expense in 2008 will increase by approximately $7 million and $2 million, respectively. Critical Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 General Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Judgments, assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies. We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows: Property, Plant and Equipment. We carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost. Maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments, which meet certain criteria, are capitalized. Depreciation is amortized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives. Our management makes judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization, useful lives and salvage values. Changes in these judgments, assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported. We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We utilize a probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. Our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following: dayrate by rig; utilization rate by rig (expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used); the per day operating cost for each rig if active, ready stacked or cold stacked; and salvage value for each rig. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we develop a matrix by assigning probabilities to various combinations of assumed utilization rates and dayrates. We also consider the impact of a 5% reduction in assumed dayrates for the cold stacked rigs (holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant), or alternatively the impact of a 5% reduction in utilization (again holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant) as part of our analysis. As of December 31, 2007, all of our drilling rigs were either under contract or were in shipyards for surveys, contract modifications or major upgrade, except for two of our jack up drilling rigs located in the GOM. At December 31, 2007, one of these idle units was under contract but waiting to begin drilling operations while the other unit was being actively marketed. We did not have any cold stacked rigs at December 31, 2007. We do not believe that current circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our property and equipment may not be recoverable. 24 Table of Contents Managements assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. Personal Injury Claims. Our deductible for liability coverage for personal injury claims, which primarily results from Jones Act liability in the Gulf of Mexico, is $5.0 million (or $10.0 million if hurricane related) per occurrence, with no aggregate deductible. The Jones Act is a federal law that permits seamen to seek compensation for certain injuries during the course of their employment on a vessel and governs the liability of vessel operators and marine employers for the work related injury or death of an employee. We engage experts to assist us in estimating our aggregate reserve for personal injury claims based on our historical losses and utilizing various actuarial models. The eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from our estimated amounts due to uncertainties such as: the severity of personal injuries claimed; significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims; the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated; inconsistent court decisions; and the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, or SFAS 109, which requires the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if necessary, which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach. For interim periods, we estimate our annual effective tax rate by forecasting our annual income before income tax, taxable income and tax expense in each of our tax jurisdictions. We make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to forecasting of our effective tax rate, the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits, and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit. We adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, or FIN 48, on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognized a long term tax receivable of $2.6 million and a long term tax liability of $31.1 million for uncertain tax positions, the net of which was accounted for as a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. We record interest related to accrued unrecognized tax positions in interest expense and recognize penalties associated with uncertain tax positions in our tax expense. 25 Table of Contents Results of Operations Although we perform contract drilling services with different types of drilling rigs and in many geographic locations, there is a similarity of economic characteristics among all our divisions and locations, including the nature of services provided and the type of customers for our services. We believe that the combination of our drilling rigs into one reportable segment is the appropriate aggregation in accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. However, for purposes of this discussion and analysis of our results of operations, we provide greater detail with respect to the types of rigs in our fleet and the geographic regions in which they operate to enhance the readers understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations.

Continued high overall utilization and historically high dayrates contributed to an overall increase in our net income of $139.7 million, or 20%, to $846.5 million in 2007 compared to $706.8 million in 2006. In many of the markets in which we operate, dayrates continued to increase compared to 2006 resulting in the generation of additional contract drilling revenues by our fleet. However, overall revenue increases were negatively impacted by the effect of downtime associated with scheduled shipyard projects and mandatory inspections or surveys, as well as the temporary ready stacking of drilling rigs between wells in the GOM jack up market. Total contract drilling revenues in 2007 increased $518.5 million, or 26%, to $2.5 billion compared to $2.0 billion in 2006. Total contract drilling expenses increased $199.1 million, or 25%, in 2007, compared to 2006, to $1.0 billion. Overall cost increases for maintenance and repairs between 2007 and 2006 reflect the impact of high, sustained utilization of our drilling units across our fleet, additional survey and related maintenance costs, contract preparation and mobilization costs, as well as the inclusion of normal operating costs for the newly upgraded Ocean Endeavor. The increase in overall operating and overhead costs also reflects the impact of higher prices throughout the offshore drilling industry and its support businesses. Our results were also impacted by higher expenses related to our mooring enhancement and other hurricane preparedness activities in 2006 and compensation increases during 2006 and 2007. Depreciation and general and administrative expenses increased $46.7 million in the aggregate, or 19% in 2007, compared to 2006, reducing our net income by $288.7 million in 2007. Net income for 2007 includes $58.6 million of non recurring U.S. federal income tax expense related to the distribution of previously untaxed earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries. High Specification Floaters. Year Ended December 31, Favorable/ 2007 2006 (Unfavorable) (In thousands) HIGH SPECIFICATION FLOATERS: CONTRACT DRILLING REVENUE GOM $ 833,751 $ 574,594 $ 259,157 Australia/Asia/Middle East 73,004 65,682 7,322 South America 124,137 126,597 (2,460 ) Total Contract Drilling Revenue $ 1,030,892 $ 766,873 $ 264,019 CONTRACT DRILLING EXPENSE GOM $ 208,140 $ 143,447 $ (64,693 ) Australia/Asia/Middle East 27,070 24,465 (2,605 ) South America 86,056 68,364 (17,692 ) Total Contract Drilling Expense $ 321,266 $ 236,276 $ (84,990 ) OPERATING INCOME $ 709,626 $ 530,597 $ 179,029 GOM. Revenues generated by our high specification floaters operating in the GOM increased $259.2 million during 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to higher average dayrates earned during 2007 ($259.1 million). Average operating revenue per day for our rigs in this market, excluding the Ocean Endeavor, increased to $354,400 during 2007 compared to $236,600 in 2006, reflecting the continued high demand for this class of rig in the GOM. Excluding the Ocean Endeavor, six of our seven other high specification semisubmersible rigs in the GOM are currently operating at dayrates higher than those they earned during 2006. The Ocean Endeavor began operating during the third quarter of 2007 and generated revenues of $42.7 million in the GOM in 2007. Average utilization for our high specification rigs operating in the GOM, excluding the Ocean Endeavor, decreased from 94% in 2006 to 87% in 2007 and resulted in a $38.4 million decline in revenues comparing the 27 Table of Contents years. The decline in utilization during the 2007 period was primarily the result of scheduled downtime for special surveys for the Ocean Star (47 days) and Ocean Quest (66 days) and for a special survey and repairs to the Ocean Baroness (149 days), Combined utilization for these three rigs was 95% during 2006. During 2006, we recognized $4.3 million in mobilization revenue for the Ocean Baroness associated with its 2005 relocation to the GOM. Operating costs during 2007 for our high specification floaters in the GOM increased $64.7 million to $208.1 million (including $16.8 million in normal operating expenses for the Ocean Endeavor) compared to 2006. The increase in operating costs in 2007 compared to 2006 reflects higher labor, benefits and other personnel related costs resulting from compensation increases, higher maintenance and project costs and incremental costs associated with regulatory surveys for the Ocean Baroness, Ocean Star and Ocean Quest, including mobilization, inspection and related repair costs. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Revenues generated by the Ocean Rover, our high specification rig operating offshore Malaysia, increased $7.3 million during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to a higher operating dayrate earned by the rig in the first quarter and last two months of 2007. Operating expenses for the Ocean Rover in 2007 increased $2.6 million to $27.1 million compared to 2006, primarily due to higher labor, benefits and maintenance and project costs, partially offset by lower insurance and other costs. South America. Revenues earned by our high specification floaters operating offshore Brazil decreased $2.5 million to $124.1 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to a decline in utilization ($5.8 million) resulting from 33 days of additional unpaid downtime in 2007 for a special survey for the Ocean Alliance. The decline in revenues in 2007 was partially offset by an increase in the average operating revenue per day from $180,100 during 2006 to $185,300 during 2007, which contributed additional revenues of $3.3 million. Contract drilling expense for our operations in Brazil increased $17.7 million during 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in costs is primarily due to survey costs for the Ocean Alliance, higher labor and benefits costs as a result of compensation increases, as well as higher catering, freight and maintenance and project costs during 2007 compared to 2006. 28 Table of Contents Intermediate Semisubmersibles.

Revenues generated during 2007 by our intermediate semisubmersible fleet decreased $53.9 million compared to 2006, primarily as a result of the fourth quarter 2006 relocation of the Ocean Lexington to Egypt, as well as shipyard time during 2007 for four of our other rigs in this market. During 2007, we completed a survey and contract preparation work for the Ocean Voyager, a service life extension project for the Ocean Saratoga and contract modifications for the Ocean Concord and Ocean New Era. Excluding the Ocean Lexington, average utilization for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the GOM (Ocean Voyager, Ocean Concord, Ocean New Era and Ocean Saratoga) declined from 84% in 2006 to 75% during 2007 and reduced revenues by $58.3 million. During 2006, the Ocean Lexington generated revenues of $33.4 million in the GOM. Of these rigs, only the Ocean Saratoga remained in the GOM as of December 31, 2007. The overall decline in revenues in 2007 was partially offset by an increase in average dayrates earned by our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the GOM during both 2007 and 2006. Average operating revenue per day, excluding the Ocean Lexington, increased from $155,200 during 2006 to $189,400 in 2007 and contributed additional revenues of $37.8 million. During 2006 and 2007, three of our rigs completed their contracts with PEMEX and temporarily returned to the GOM. The Ocean Whittington returned to the GOM in July 2006 for a survey, contract preparation work and a service life extension. The Ocean Yorktown and Ocean Worker returned to the GOM in July 2007 and August 2007, respectively for surveys and contract preparation work, as well as a service life extension project for the Ocean Yorktown. All three rigs were located in shipyards in the GOM for extended periods during 2007, and we incurred additional costs in the GOM associated with these activities. During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, the Ocean Whittington and the Ocean Worker departed the GOM for Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago, respectively, where they are working under contract. The Ocean Yorktown is expected to leave for Brazil in the second quarter of 2008. Contract drilling expenses decreased by $0.9 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Increased costs in the GOM associated with surveys and contract preparation activities, as well as higher labor and related costs during 2007 were offset by lower normal operating costs in the GOM as a result of the numerous rigs that were relocated from the region at the end of 2006 and during 2007. 29 Table of Contents Mexico. Revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating offshore Mexico increased $5.6 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The relocation of the Ocean New Era and Ocean Voyager from the GOM to Mexico in the fourth quarter of 2007 generated an additional $33.3 million in revenues for this region in 2007. Revenues generated in 2007 were reduced by $28.5 million due to the return of the Ocean Whittington in July 2006 and the Ocean Worker and Ocean Yorktown in the third quarter of 2007 to the GOM. Our operating costs in Mexico increased by $3.2 million in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the inclusion of operating costs for the Ocean New Era and Ocean Voyager and costs to mobilize the Ocean Worker and Ocean Yorktown from Mexico to the GOM. The overall increase in costs was partially offset by the absence of operating costs for the Ocean Whittington in 2007 and reduced normal operating costs for the Ocean Worker and Ocean Yorktown beginning in the third quarter of 2007. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the Australia/Asia/Middle East regions generated revenues of $239.2 million in 2007 compared to revenues of $196.2 million in 2006. The $43.0 million increase in operating revenue was primarily due to an increase in average operating revenue per day from $135,600 in 2006 to $169,900 in 2007, which generated additional revenues of $45.4 million during 2007. The increase in average operating revenue per day is primarily attributable to an increase in the contractual dayrates earned by the Ocean Patriot that occurred in the third quarter of 2007, and the Ocean Epoch and Ocean General that occurred during the second and third quarters of 2006, respectively. Average utilization in this region decreased to 94% during 2007 from 97% utilization during 2006, primarily due to 46 days of incremental unpaid downtime in 2007, as compared to 2006, for repairs as well as a survey of the Ocean General and an environmental survey of the Ocean Patriot and related removal of an invasive species of green, lipped mussels that had attached itself to the rig while working offshore New Zealand. The decline in utilization during 2007 reduced revenues by $4.4 million. Additionally, during 2007 we recognized $4.6 million in mobilization revenue in connection with the relocations of the Ocean Epoch and the Ocean General to other areas within the Australia/Asia region. During 2006, we recognized $2.3 million in mobilization revenue for the relocation of the Ocean Patriot to New Zealand. Contract drilling expense for the Australia/Asia/Middle East region increased $27.0 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in operating costs was primarily due to higher labor and personnel related costs, including higher local labor costs for the Ocean Epoch, which relocated to Australia in the fourth quarter of 2006 from Malaysia. Other cost increases for our rigs operating in this region during 2007, as compared to 2006, include higher repair and maintenance costs, higher freight costs and additional costs associated with the environmental survey of the Ocean Patriot. These increased costs were partially offset by lower agency fee costs incurred by the Ocean Epoch in 2007 compared to 2006 when the rig was operating offshore Malaysia. Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. Operating revenue for our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean regions increased $193.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Overall utilization during 2007 increased primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean Lexington ($97.1 million) from the GOM to offshore Egypt in the fourth quarter of 2006. Additionally, the Ocean Princess generated additional revenues of $8.4 million during 2007 compared to 2006 when the rig had 48 days of downtime for an intermediate survey and related repairs. These favorable variances resulting from the increased utilization of two of our rigs in this region were partially offset by 18 days of unpaid downtime for an intermediate survey of the Ocean Vanguard that reduced revenues by $1.9 million in 2007. Also during 2006, we recognized $4.4 million in revenues related to the amortization of lump sum fees received from customers for capital improvements to the Ocean Guardian and Ocean Vanguard. Average operating revenue per day for our North Sea semisubmersibles increased from $144,500 in 2006 to $211,500 in 2007, contributing $93.9 million in additional revenue in 2007 as compared to 2006. The overall increase in average operating revenue per day in this market was primarily due to higher dayrates earned by the Ocean Nomad, Ocean Guardian and Ocean Vanguard during 2007. Contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean markets increased $34.6 million in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating costs for the Ocean Lexington ($21.8 million). Increased operating expenses in 2007 are also reflective of higher labor and benefits costs incurred in 2007 for our rigs operating in the North Sea, including the effect of compensation increases and implementation of a retention plan, and higher shorebase support 30 Table of Contents costs. However, overall operating expense increases in this region during 2007 were partially offset by lower mobilization and inspection costs associated with surveys, as costs incurred for the Ocean Vanguards intermediate survey in December 2007 were well below aggregate expenses related to surveys for the Ocean Guardian and Ocean Princess in 2006. South America. Revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the South American region increased $55.4 million to $132.1 million in 2007 from $76.7 million in 2006. During 2007, we relocated the Ocean Whittington (Brazil) and the Ocean Worker (Trinidad and Tobago) to this region where they generated revenues of $25.7 million and $21.5 million, respectively. For our other two semisubmersible rigs operating offshore Brazil in both 2007 and 2006, average operating revenue per day in 2007 increased to $123,900 from $113,700 in 2006, resulting in a $7.0 million increase in revenue from 2006. Operating expenses for our operations in the South American region increased $30.6 million in 2007, as compared to 2006, partially due to the inclusion of normal operating and start up costs for the Ocean Whittington and the Ocean Worker, as well as start up costs for the Ocean Concord which relocated to Brazil from the GOM in the fourth quarter of 2007 to begin a five year contract. The Ocean Concord did not begin operating under contract until 2008. Other cost increases during 2007 compared to 2006 include increased labor and other personnel related costs, shorebase support and freight costs, as well as higher repair and maintenance costs.

Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the GOM decreased $93.0 million during 2007 compared to 2006. The decline in revenues is primarily due to the relocation of three of our jack up rigs from the GOM to other markets: the Ocean King to Croatia in the third quarter of 2007; the Ocean Nugget to Mexico in the fourth quarter of 2006; and the Ocean Spur to Tunisia in the first quarter of 2006. These rigs generated $56.0 million in revenues while operating in the GOM in 2006 compared to only $13.3 million earned by the Ocean King in the GOM during 2007. In addition, the Ocean Columbia, which was in a shipyard for a majority of the fourth quarter of 2007 for preparation work in connection with an 18 month contract offshore Mexico, generated revenues of $28.8 million in the GOM during 2007 compared to $37.5 million in 2006. Average utilization (excluding the Ocean Columbia, Ocean King, Ocean Nugget and Ocean Spur) declined from 90% during 2006 to 78% during 2007 resulting in a reduction in revenues of $29.6 million. The decline in utilization was primarily in response to market conditions in the GOM that caused us to ready stack certain of our jack up rigs for a portion of time between wells, scheduled downtime for surveys of the Ocean Crusader and Ocean Tower and contract preparation activities for the Ocean Columbia. The Ocean Columbia departed the GOM for Mexico at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007. 31 Table of Contents Revenues also declined due to a decrease in average operating dayrates. Average operating revenue per day in 2007, excluding the Ocean Columbia, Ocean King, Ocean Nugget and Ocean Spur, decreased to $90,500 from $96,500 in 2006, resulting in a $11.9 million decrease in revenue from 2006. Contract drilling expense in the GOM increased $7.7 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The overall increase in costs was primarily due to higher survey and related repair costs in 2007, contract preparation activities for the Ocean Columbia, as well as increased repair and ready stacking costs for several of our rigs marketed in the GOM. In addition, operating costs for our rigs in this market were negatively impacted by regular salary increases and higher overhead costs. The overall increase in operating costs was partially offset by the absence of operating costs in the GOM for the Ocean Nugget and Ocean Spur and lower operating costs for the Ocean King during 2007, which reduced operating expenses by $19.5 million. Mexico. The Ocean Nugget, which began operating offshore Mexico in the fourth quarter of 2006, generated $62.5 million in revenues during 2007 and incurred contract drilling expenses of $16.1 million. We had no jack up rigs operating in this market prior to the fourth quarter of 2006. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Our two jack up rigs operating in the Australia/Asia/Middle East regions generated revenues of $88.5 million during 2007 compared to $61.1 million in 2006. The $27.4 million increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in average operating revenue per day earned by our rigs in this region from $95,600 during 2006 to $123,600 for 2007, primarily due to new contracts at higher dayrates for both the Ocean Heritage and Ocean Sovereign that began late in the second and third quarters of 2006, respectively, as well as additional dayrate increases for both rigs during 2007 which generated additional revenues of $19.5 million. Average utilization for our rigs in this region increased from 87% during 2006 to 98% in 2007 primarily due to increased utilization for both the Ocean Heritage and Ocean Sovereign in 2007, as compared to 2006 when these rigs were out of service for scheduled surveys and related repairs. The increase in utilization in 2007 resulted in the generation of additional revenues of $8.3 million. Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean regions increased $30.1 million during 2007 compared to 2006. Our jack up rig, the Ocean Spur, began operating offshore Tunisia in March 2006 and generated revenues of $42.8 million and $32.9 million during 2006 and 2007, respectively. The rig subsequently mobilized to the Mediterranean Basin and began operating offshore Egypt in late May 2007, generating revenues of $36.6 million. During the third quarter of 2007, we relocated the Ocean King from the GOM to Croatia where it began operating under a two year bareboat charter, generating revenues of $3.3 million in 2007. Operating expenses in this region increased $4.9 million during 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of operating costs for the Ocean Spur in 2007 compared to only nine and one half months of expenses during 2006. Reimbursable expenses, net. Revenues related to reimbursable items, offset by the related expenditures for these items, were $9.2 million and $8.0 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Reimbursable expenses include items that we purchase, and or services we perform, at the request of our customers. We charge our customers for purchases and or services performed on their behalf at cost, plus a mark up where applicable. Therefore, net reimbursables fluctuate based on customer requirements, which vary. Depreciation. Depreciation expense increased $34.7 million to $235.2 million in 2007 compared to $200.5 million in 2006 primarily due to depreciation associated with capital additions in 2006 and 2007, as well as higher depreciation expense for the Ocean Endeavor due to the completion of its major upgrade in March 2007. 32 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expense. We incurred general and administrative expense of $53.5 million in 2007 compared to $41.6 million in 2006. The $11.9 million increase in overhead costs between the periods was primarily due to an increase in payroll costs resulting from higher compensation and staffing increases, legal fees, engineering and tax consulting fees and miscellaneous office expenses. Gain (Loss) on Disposition of Assets. We recognized a net gain of $8.6 million on the sale and disposition of assets, net of disposal costs, in 2007 compared to a net loss of $1.1 million in 2006. The gain recognized in 2007 primarily consists of the recognition of gains on insurance settlements and from sales of used equipment. The loss recognized in 2006 is primarily the result of costs associated with the removal of production equipment from the Ocean Monarch, which was subsequently sold to a third party. Interest Expense. We recorded interest expense during 2007 of $19.2 million, representing a $4.9 million decrease in interest cost compared to 2006. This decrease was primarily attributable to a greater amount of interest capitalized during 2007 related to our qualifying rig upgrades and construction projects and lower interest cost associated with our 1.5% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2031, or 1.5% Debentures. This decrease was partially offset by $9.2 million in debt issuance costs that we wrote off during 2007 in connection with conversions of our 1.5% Debentures and our Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures due 2020, or Zero Coupon Debentures, into shares of our common stock. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements 1.5% Debentures and Liquidity and Capital Requirements Zero Coupon Debentures. Other Income and Expense (Other, net). Included in Other, net are foreign currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses and other income and expense items, among other things, which are not attributable to our drilling operations. The components of Other, net fluctuate based on the level of activity, as well as fluctuations in foreign currencies. We recorded other income, net, of $6.8 million during 2007 and other income, net, of $12.1 million in 2006. During 2007 and 2006, we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of $2.9 million and $10.3 million, respectively. Income Tax Expense. Our net income tax expense is a function of the mix of our domestic and international pre tax earnings, as well as the mix of earnings from the international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognized $400.0 million of tax expense on pre tax income of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to tax expense of $259.5 million on a pre tax income of $966.3 million in 2006. Certain of our international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited, a Cayman Islands subsidiary which we wholly own. Since forming this subsidiary in 2002, it has been our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of this subsidiary to finance foreign activities. Consequently, no U.S. federal income taxes were provided on these earnings in years subsequent to 2002 except to the extent that such earnings were immediately subject to U.S. federal income tax. In December 2007, this subsidiary made a non recurring distribution of $850.0 million to its U.S. parent, a portion of which consisted of earnings of the subsidiary that had not previously been subjected to U.S. federal income tax. We recognized $58.6 million of U.S. federal income tax expense as a result of the distribution. As of December 31, 2007, the amount of previously untaxed earnings of this subsidiary was zero. Notwithstanding the non recurring distribution made in December 2007, it remains our intention to indefinitely reinvest future earnings of this subsidiary to finance foreign activities. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007 we recognized $4.4 million of tax expense for uncertain tax positions related to the current year, $0.8 million of which was penalty related tax expense. 33 Table of Contents During 2006 we were able to utilize all of the foreign tax credits available to us and we had no foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2006. At the end of 2005, we had a valuation allowance of $0.8 million for certain of our foreign tax credit carryforwards which was reversed during 2006 as the valuation allowance was no longer necessary. During 2006 we recorded an $8.3 million tax benefit related to the deduction allowable under Internal Revenue Code Section 199 for domestic production activities. During the second quarter of 2006, the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service issued guidelines regarding the deduction allowable under Internal Revenue Code Section 199 which was previously believed to be unavailable to the drilling industry with respect to qualified production activities income. The $8.3 million tax benefit recognized included $2.2 million related to the year 2005. 34 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 Comparative data relating to our revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are presented below.

Dayrates generally increased during 2006, compared to 2005, and resulted in the generation of additional contract drilling revenues by our fleet. The effect of higher dayrates earned by our rigs was negatively impacted by the effect of downtime associated with mandatory surveys and related repair time, as well as lower dayrates earned by some of our semisubmersible rigs due to previously established job sequencing that caused the units to temporarily roll to older contracts with lower dayrates. Total contract drilling revenues in 2006 increased $808.1 million to $1,987.1 million, or 69% compared to 2005. 35 Table of Contents Total contract drilling expenses in 2006 increased $173.5 million to $812.1 million, or 27% compared to 2005. Our results in 2006 were negatively impacted by higher expenses related to our mooring enhancement and other hurricane preparedness activities, compensation increases and mandatory surveys performed during 2006. The increase in survey costs included higher expenses for survey related services and higher boat charges associated with moving rigs to and from shipyards. In addition, overall cost increases for maintenance and repairs between 2005 and 2006 reflect the impact of high, sustained utilization of our drilling units across our fleet and in all geographic locations in which we operate. The increase in overall operating and overhead costs also reflected the impact of higher prices throughout the offshore drilling industry and its support businesses. The increase in our operating expenses in 2006, as compared to 2005, was partially offset by an $8.0 million reduction in our reserve for personal injury claims based on an actuarial review. Net income for 2006 compared to 2005 reflected higher interest income on invested cash balances combined with lower interest expense on our outstanding debentures due to debt conversions in 2006 and foreign currency exchange gains recognized in 2006. These favorable contributions to net income were partially offset by higher depreciation and general and administrative expenses of $21.2 million in 2006 compared to 2005. Additionally, during 2005, we recognized a $33.6 million casualty gain due to the constructive total loss of the Ocean Warwick as a result of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 and an $8.0 million gain related to the June 2005 sale of the Ocean Liberator. Our net income in 2006 was reduced by $259.5 million of income tax expense on pre tax earnings of $966.3 million compared to income tax expense of $96.1 million on pre tax earnings of $356.4 million in 2005.

Revenues generated by our high specification floaters operating in the GOM increased $270.0 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to higher average dayrates earned during the period and revenues generated by the Ocean Baroness, which relocated to the GOM from the Australia/Asia market in the latter half of 2005 ($58.1 million). Excluding the Ocean Baroness, average operating revenue per day for our rigs in this market increased to $242,000 during 2006, compared to $142,600 during 2005, generating additional revenues of $211.6 million. The higher overall dayrates achieved for our high specification floaters reflected the continuing high demand for this class of rig in the GOM. Average utilization for our high specification rigs operating in the GOM, excluding the contribution from the Ocean Baroness, increased slightly to 96% in 2006 compared to 2005, and resulted in $0.2 million in revenue. Operating costs during 2006 for our high specification floaters in the GOM increased $55.3 million over operating costs incurred during 2005. The increase in operating costs was primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating costs and amortization of mobilization expenses for the Ocean Baroness during 2006 ($30.6 million) compared to the prior year when this drilling rig operated offshore Indonesia. In addition, our operating expenses 36 Table of Contents for 2006, compared to 2005, reflected higher labor and benefits costs related to late 2005 and first quarter of 2006 wage increases, higher repair and maintenance costs, and higher miscellaneous operating expenses, including catering costs. Our operating expenses in 2005 reflected a $2.0 million reduction in costs due to a recovery from a customer for damages sustained by one of our GOM rigs during Hurricane Ivan in 2004, partially offset by the recognition of $0.5 million in deductibles for damages sustained during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Australia/Asia. Revenues generated by our high specification rigs in the Australia/Asia/Middle East market decreased $2.7 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean Baroness from this market to the GOM in the latter half of 2005. Prior to its relocation to the GOM, the Ocean Baroness generated $18.2 million in revenues during 2005. The decrease in revenues in 2006 was partially offset by additional revenue ($13.7 million) generated by an increase in the dayrate earned by the Ocean Rover compared to the prior year. The average operating revenue per day for this rig increased from $143,500 in 2005 to $181,500 in 2006 as a result of a new drilling program which began in the second quarter of 2006. Utilization improvements for the Ocean Rover during 2006, as compared to 2005 when the unit had 11 days of downtime for repairs, generated an additional $1.8 million in revenues. Operating costs for our rigs in the Australia/Asia/Middle East market decreased $11.4 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean Baroness to the GOM ($15.5 million). This decrease was partially offset by an increase in operating costs for the Ocean Rover during 2006, compared to the prior year, primarily related to higher personnel related costs as a result of late 2005 and March 2006 compensation increases, increased agency fee costs (which are based on a percentage of revenues) and higher other miscellaneous operating expenses. South America. Revenues for our high specification rigs operating offshore Brazil increased $50.7 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to higher average dayrates earned by our rigs in this market ($44.1 million). Average operating revenue per day earned by the Ocean Alliance and the Ocean Clipper increased to $180,100 during 2006 up from $117,300 during the prior year as a result of contract renewals for both rigs in the latter part of 2005. Utilization for our rigs offshore Brazil increased from 89% in 2005 to 96% in 2006, contributing $6.6 million in additional revenues in 2006, primarily due to less downtime during 2006 for repairs. Contract drilling expenses for our operations offshore Brazil increased $13.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in costs was primarily due to higher labor, benefits and other personnel related costs as a result of 2005 and March 2006 compensation increases and other compensation enhancement programs, increased agency fee costs (which are based on a percentage of revenues), higher freight costs and higher maintenance and project costs. 37 Table of Contents Intermediate Semisubmersibles.

Revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the GOM during 2006 increased $124.8 million over the prior year primarily due to higher average operating dayrates and the operation of the Ocean New Era ($53.9 million) which was reactivated in December 2005. Average operating dayrates for the remainder of our GOM fleet of intermediate rigs increased from $77,300 in 2005 to $149,300 in 2006 and generated additional revenues of $82.2 million during 2006. Excluding the Ocean New Era, utilization fell from 87% in 2005 to 75% in 2006, resulting in an $11.3 million reduction in revenues generated in 2006 compared to 2005. Average utilization in 2006 was negatively impacted by approximately five months of downtime for the Ocean Saratoga in connection with its survey and related repairs, as well as a life enhancement upgrade that commenced in the third quarter of 2006 and approximately one month of downtime for both the Ocean Voyager and Ocean Concord for mooring upgrades. Partially offsetting the decline in average utilization in 2006 was an improvement in utilization for the Ocean Lexington, which worked nearly all of 2006 prior to its move to Egypt at the beginning of the fourth quarter. During 2005, the Ocean Lexington incurred over four months of downtime for a survey and life enhancement upgrade. Contract drilling expense for our GOM operations increased $30.6 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to normal operating costs for the Ocean New Era in 2006 ($7.6 million) and repair and other normal operating costs for the Ocean Whittington ($6.4 million) in the latter half of 2006 after its return from Mexico. Higher operating costs in 2006, as compared to 2005, reflected higher labor and benefits costs as a result of September 2005 and March 2006 wage increases for our rig based personnel, mobilization costs associated with mooring upgrades for the Ocean Concord and Ocean Voyager, survey and related repair costs for the Ocean Saratoga and higher maintenance and other miscellaneous operating costs for our semisubmersible rigs in this market segment. In addition, during 2006, we incurred $2.4 million in costs associated with the rental of mooring lines and chains as temporary replacements for equipment lost during the 2005 hurricanes in the GOM. Partially offsetting the increased operating costs in 2006 was the absence of reactivation costs for the Ocean New Era, which returned to service in December 2005. Mexico. Revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersibles operating offshore Mexico during 2006 decreased $5.1 million compared to 2005, primarily due to PEMEXs early cancellation of its contract for the Ocean Whittington in July 2006, partially offset by increased revenues for the Ocean Worker as a result of a small dayrate increase received in December 2005. Operating costs in Mexico increased $3.2 million during 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to the effect of 2005 and March 2006 wage increases for our rig based personnel, as well as higher repair and maintenance costs, other miscellaneous operating costs and overheads, partially offset by lower 38 Table of Contents operating costs for the Ocean Whittington pursuant to its third quarter relocation to the GOM after termination of its drilling contract by PEMEX. In addition, we incurred $1.9 million in costs associated with the demobilization of the Ocean Whittington from offshore Mexico to the GOM. Australia/Asia. Our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the Australia/Asia market during 2006 generated an additional $84.4 million in revenues compared to 2005 primarily due to higher average operating dayrates ($84.3 million). Average operating dayrates increased from $76,300 in 2005 to $135,600 in 2006. In addition, the over 95% utilization of both the Ocean Epoch and Ocean Patriot during 2006, as compared to 2005 when the average utilization for these two rigs was 84%, contributed an additional $6.6 million to 2006 revenues. During 2005 the Ocean Epoch had over two months of downtime associated with a scheduled 5 year survey, other regulatory inspections and contract preparation work prior to its relocation to Malaysia and the Ocean Patriot incurred over one month of downtime associated with an intermediate inspection and repairs. These favorable revenue variances in 2006 were partially offset by the lower recognition of deferred mobilization, capital upgrade and other fees in 2006 compared to 2005. During 2006, we recognized $2.3 million in lump sum mobilization revenue related to the Ocean Patriots move offshore New Zealand at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2006 and equipment upgrade fees from two customers in connection with customer requested capital improvements to the Ocean Patriot. However, during 2005, we recognized $5.7 million and $0.9 million in connection with the Ocean Patriots 2004 mobilization from South Africa to New Zealand and the Bass Strait and equipment upgrade fees, respectively. Additionally, we received a fee from another customer in this market for a drilling option for another rig, of which $0.6 million and $3.7 million were recognized in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Contract drilling expense for the Australia/Asia/Middle East region increased slightly from $83.8 million in 2005 to $87.5 million in 2006. The $3.8 million net increase in costs for 2006 was primarily the result of higher labor costs (due to wage increases in late 2005 and March 2006), higher repair and maintenance costs, higher revenue based agency fees and higher other operating costs. These unfavorable cost trends were partially offset by lower survey and inspection costs in 2006 and the recognition of an insurance deductible in 2005 related to an anchor winch failure on the Ocean Patriot. In addition, we recognized $1.1 million and $5.2 million in mobilization expenses for our rigs in this region during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The amount of mobilization expenses recognized during a period is dependent upon the duration of the rig move and the contract period over which the mobilization costs are to be recognized. Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. Revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersibles operating in this market increased $101.0 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in the average operating revenue per day earned by our rigs in this market. Excluding the Ocean Lexington, which began operating in this market sector during the fourth quarter of 2006 and contributed revenues of $5.6 million, the average operating revenue per day for our rigs operating in this market increased from $87,500 in 2005 to $144,500 in 2006. This increase in average revenue per day generated additional revenues of $70.6 million in 2006 compared to 2005. All three of our rigs operating in the U.K. sector of the North Sea received operating dayrate increases during 2006 and the Ocean Vanguard began a drilling program in the fourth quarter of 2006 at a higher dayrate than it previously earned. Average utilization for our rigs in the Europe/Africa region increased from 83% in 2005 to 94% in 2006, excluding the Ocean Lexington, generating $20.7 million in additional revenues. The increase in average utilization was primarily due to higher utilization in 2006 for the Ocean Vanguard, compared to 2005 when this unit incurred more than five months of downtime due to an anchor winch failure and for a 5 year survey and related repairs. Additionally, average utilization for our three rigs operating in the U.K. sector of the North Sea increased slightly, reflecting the nearly full utilization of the Ocean Nomad during 2006 compared to 2005, when the rig was ready stacked for almost three weeks and incurred nearly a full month of downtime for repairs. These favorable utilization trends were partially offset by 48 days of downtime for the Ocean Princess which was in a shipyard for an intermediate survey during 2006. In comparison, the Ocean Princess operated for nearly all of 2005. During 2006, we also recognized $4.4 million in revenues related to the amortization of lump sum fees received from customers for capital improvements to the Ocean Guardian and Ocean Vanguard. Contract drilling expenses for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the Europe/Africa region increased $16.5 million during 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to the inclusion of $4.2 million of normal operating costs for the Ocean Lexington in Egypt and costs associated with scheduled surveys for the Ocean 39 Table of Contents Guardian and Ocean Princess, including mobilization and related repair costs during 2006. Also contributing to the increase in costs during 2006 were higher personnel and related costs (including administrative and support personnel in the region), reflecting the impact of wage increases after September 2005 and higher overall other operating costs. These cost increases in 2006 were partially offset by lower maintenance costs for the Ocean Vanguard in 2006 compared to 2005 and the absence of mobilization costs in 2006 related to the Ocean Nomads relocation from Gabon to the North Sea at the end of 2004, which were fully recognized in 2005, as well as the 2005 recognition of mobilization costs incurred in connection with the Ocean Guardians first quarter 2006 survey. South America. Revenues generated by our two intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in Brazil in 2006 increased $23.2 million to $76.7 million in 2006 from $53.6 million in 2005, primarily due to higher average operating dayrates earned by both of our rigs in this market. Average operating revenue per day rose from $75,100 in 2005 to $113,700 in 2006, contributing $26.4 million in additional revenues. Reduced utilization for our two intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating offshore Brazil during 2006, compared to 2005, was primarily the result of additional downtime for repairs during 2006, including 45 days of downtime for a thruster change out on the Ocean Yatzy. This overall decrease in average utilization in 2006 resulted in a $3.2 million reduction in revenues compared to the prior year. Operating expenses for the Ocean Yatzy and Ocean Winner increased $11.5 million in 2006 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased labor costs for our rig based and shore based personnel as a result of wage increases and other compensation enhancement programs implemented after the third quarter of 2005, higher revenue based agency fees, as well as higher repair, maintenance and freight costs and increases in other routine operating costs in 2006 compared to 2005.

Revenues generated by our jack up rigs in the GOM increased $92.9 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an improvement in average operating dayrates for our rigs in this region. Excluding the Ocean Warwick, which was declared a constructive total loss in the third quarter of 2005, our average operating revenue per day increased to $100,800 in 2006 from $59,100 in 2005, generating additional revenues of $141.9 million. GOM revenues were reduced $37.2 million due to changes in average utilization which fell to 79% in 2006 from 96% in 2005 (excluding the Ocean Warwick). During 2006, utilization in the GOM was negatively impacted primarily by the relocation of the Ocean Spur to Tunisia in the first quarter of 2006 and over five months of downtime for the Ocean Nugget for a special survey, related repairs and contract preparation work prior to its relocation to Mexico in the fourth 40 Table of Contents quarter of 2006. Also during 2006, the Ocean Spartan underwent leg repairs and was ready stacked from mid September 2006 until mid December 2006 for total downtime of approximately four months, and the Ocean Summit incurred over three months of downtime for a special survey and related repairs. During 2005, the Ocean Warwick generated revenues of $11.8 million. Contract drilling expense in the GOM during 2006 increased $13.7 million compared to 2005. The increase in 2006 operating costs was primarily due to higher labor and other personnel related costs as a result of late 2005 and March 2006 wage increases, costs associated with special surveys and related repairs for the Ocean Summit and Ocean Nugget, leg repairs for the Ocean Nugget, leg/spud can repairs for the Ocean Spartan and higher overhead, catering and other miscellaneous operating expenses. The overall increase in contract drilling expenses was partially offset by the absence of operating costs for the Ocean Warwick during 2006 and reduced operating costs in the GOM for the Ocean Spur (which only operated in the GOM for 45 days in 2006 before relocating to Tunisia) and the Ocean Nugget (which was relocated to Mexico at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2006). Both the Ocean Spur and Ocean Nugget operated solely in the GOM during 2005. Also partially offsetting these negative cost trends was a reduction in survey and related mobilization costs during 2006 associated with the Ocean Spartans survey in late 2005. We also recognized a $1.0 million insurance deductible for a leg punchthrough incident on the Ocean Spartan in 2005. Mexico. Our jack up rig the Ocean Nugget, which relocated to Mexico at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2006, generated $16.0 million there in 2006. This unit is contracted to work for PEMEX through March 2009. Contract drilling expenses related to this rig were $4.4 million. We had no jack up units operating in this market during 2005. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Revenues generated by our jack up rigs in the Australia/Asia and Middle East regions were $61.1 million in 2006 compared to $49.4 million in 2005. The $11.7 million increase in revenues in this region during 2006 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to higher average operating dayrates for both of our jack up rigs in this region ($15.1 million). Average dayrates for our jack up rigs in this region increased from $71,900 in 2005 to $95,600 in 2006. The favorable contribution to operating revenues by the increase in average operating dayrates was partially offset by the reduced recognition of deferred mobilization revenues in 2006, as compared to 2005 ($3.1 million), and the effect of slightly lower average utilization in this region in 2006 compared to 2005 ($0.3 million). Contract drilling expenses for our jack up rigs in the Australia/Asia and Middle East regions increased slightly from $25.0 million in 2005 to $27.7 million in 2006. Higher labor costs in 2006 (resulting from late 2005 and early 2006 wage increases), higher maintenance, inspection costs and revenue based agency fees were partially offset by the 2005 recognition of an insurance deductible for leg damage to the Ocean Heritage and the recognition of mobilization costs related to relocation of the Ocean Sovereign to locations offshore Bangladesh and Indonesia during 2005. Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. The Ocean Spur began operating offshore Tunisia in mid March 2006 and generated $42.8 million in revenues, including the recognition of $5.3 million in deferred mobilization revenue, and incurred operating expenses of $14.8 million during 2006. We did not have any of our jack up rigs working in this region during 2005. Other Contract Drilling. Other contract drilling expenses increased $15.4 million during 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to the inclusion of $12.7 million in costs related to anchor boat rental and other costs associated with our mooring enhancement and hurricane preparedness activities, which were implemented in response to mooring issues which arose during the 2005 hurricane season. Reimbursable expenses, net. Revenues related to reimbursable items, offset by the related expenditures for these items, were $8.0 million and $6.4 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Reimbursable expenses include items that we purchase, and or services we perform, at the request of our customers. We charge our customers for purchases and or services performed on their behalf at cost, plus a mark up where applicable. Therefore, net reimbursables fluctuate based on customer requirements, which vary. 41 Table of Contents Depreciation. Depreciation expense increased $16.8 million to $200.5 million during 2006 compared to $183.7 million during the same period in 2005 primarily due to depreciation associated with capital additions in 2005 and 2006, partially offset by lower depreciation expense resulting from the declaration of a constructive total loss of the Ocean Warwick in the third quarter of 2005. General and Administrative Expense. We incurred general and administrative expense of $41.6 million during 2006 compared to $37.2 million during 2005. The $4.4 million increase in overhead costs between the periods was primarily due to the recognition of stock based compensation expense pursuant to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), effective January 1, 2006. Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets. We recognized a net loss of $1.1 million on the sale and disposal of assets, including disposal costs, during 2006 compared to a net gain of $14.8 million during 2005. The loss recognized in 2006 was primarily the result of costs associated with the removal of production equipment from the Ocean Monarch, which was subsequently sold to a third party, partially offset by a $1.1 million recovery from certain of our customers related to the involuntary conversion of assets damaged during the 2005 hurricanes. Results for 2005 included a gain of $8.0 million related to the June 2005 sale of the Ocean Liberator, $5.6 million in insurance proceeds related to the involuntary conversion of certain assets damaged during Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and gains on the sale of used drill pipe during the period, partially offset by a $1.4 million loss due to the retirement of equipment lost or damaged during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Casualty Gain on Ocean Warwick. We recorded a $33.6 million casualty gain in 2005 as a result of the constructive total loss of the Ocean Warwick, resulting from damages sustained during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. Subsequently in 2006, we revised our estimate of expected deductibles related to this incident and recorded a $0.5 million favorable adjustment to Casualty Gain on Ocean Warwick. See Overview Impact of 2005 Hurricanes. Interest Income. We earned interest income of $37.9 million during 2006 compared to $26.0 million in 2005. The $11.9 million increase in interest income was primarily the result of the combined effect of slightly higher interest rates earned on higher average invested cash balances in 2006, as compared to 2005. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements and Historical Cash Flows. Interest Expense. We recorded interest expense of $24.1 million during 2006, reflecting a $17.7 million decrease in interest cost compared to 2005. The decrease in interest cost was primarily attributable to lower interest expense in 2006 related to our Zero Coupon Debentures as a result of our June 2005 repurchase of $774.1 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of Zero Coupon Debentures, the associated write off of $6.9 million of debt issuance costs in June 2005 and the conversion of $22.4 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of Zero Coupon Debentures into shares of our common stock during 2006. In addition we capitalized an additional $9.1 million in interest costs in connection with qualifying upgrades and construction projects during 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in interest cost was partially offset by additional interest expense on our 4.875% Senior Notes due July 1, 2015, or 4.875% Senior Notes, which we issued in June 2005. Other Income and Expense (Other, net). Included in Other, net are foreign currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses and other income and expense items, among other things, which are not attributable to our drilling operations. The components of Other, net fluctuate based on the level of activity, as well as fluctuations in foreign currencies. We recorded other income, net, of $12.1 million during 2006 and other expense, net, of $1.1 million in 2005. 42 Table of Contents Effective October 1, 2005, we changed the functional currency of certain of our subsidiaries operating outside the United States to the U.S. dollar to more appropriately reflect the primary economic environment in which these subsidiaries operate. Prior to this date, these subsidiaries utilized the local currency of the country in which they conducted business as their functional currency. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of $10.3 million and net foreign currency exchange losses of $0.8 million, respectively. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, we accounted for foreign currency translation gains and losses as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive losses in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report. Income Tax Expense. Our net income tax expense is a function of the mix of our domestic and international pre tax earnings, as well as the mix of earnings from the international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognized $259.5 million of tax expense on pre tax income of $966.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to tax expense of $96.1 million on a pre tax income of $356.4 million in 2005. During 2006 we were able to utilize all of the foreign tax credits available to us and we had no foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2006. At the end of 2005, we had a valuation allowance of $0.8 million for certain of our foreign tax credit carryforwards which was reversed during 2006 as the valuation allowance was no longer necessary. During 2005, we reversed $9.6 million of the previously established $10.3 million valuation allowance for certain of our foreign tax credit carryforwards. During 2006 we recorded an $8.3 million tax benefit related to the deduction allowable under Internal Revenue Code Section 199 for domestic production activities. During the second quarter of 2006, the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service issued guidelines regarding the deduction allowable under Internal Revenue Code Section 199 which was previously believed to be unavailable to the drilling industry with respect to qualified production activities income. The $8.3 million tax benefit recognized included $2.2 million related to the year 2005. During 2005, we reversed a previously established reserve of $8.9 million ($1.7 million included with Current Taxes Payable and $7.2 million in Other Liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets) associated with exposure related to the disallowance of goodwill deductibility associated with a 1996 acquisition which we believed was no longer necessary. During 2005, we settled an income tax dispute in East Timor (formerly part of Indonesia) for approximately $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, our books reflected an accrued liability of $4.4 million related to potential East Timor and Indonesian income tax liabilities covering the period 1992 through 2000. Subsequent to the tax settlement, we determined that the accrual was no longer necessary and reversed the accrued liability in the fourth quarter of 2005. During 2004 and 2005, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, examined our federal income tax returns for tax years 2000 and 2002. The examination was concluded during the fourth quarter of 2005. We and the IRS agreed to a limited number of adjustments for which we recorded additional income tax of $1.9 million in 2005. 43 Table of Contents Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from our operations and our cash reserves. We may also make use of our $285 million credit facility for cash liquidity. See $285 Million Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2007, we had $638.0 million in Cash and cash equivalents and $1.3 million in Investments and marketable securities, representing our investment of cash available for current operations. Cash Flows from Operations. Our internally generated cash flow is directly related to our business and the geographic regions in which we operate. Deterioration in the offshore drilling market or poor operating results may result in reduced cash flows from operations. The dayrates we receive for our drilling rigs and rig utilization rates are a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace, which is generally correlated with the price of oil and natural gas. Demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development, a variety of political and economic factors and availability of rigs in a particular geographic region. As utilization rates increase, dayrates tend to increase as well reflecting the lower supply of available rigs, and vice versa. These external factors which affect our cash flows from operations are not within our control and are difficult to predict. For a description of other factors that could affect our cash flows from operations, see Overview Industry Conditions, Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. $285 Million Revolving Credit Facility. We maintain a $285 million syndicated, 5 year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility, for general corporate purposes, including loans and performance or standby letters of credit. Loans under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, either (i) the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin, varying from 0.20% to 0.525%, based on our current credit ratings. Under our Credit Facility, we also pay, based on our current credit ratings, and as applicable, other customary fees, including, but not limited to, a facility fee on the total commitment under the Credit Facility regardless of usage and a utilization fee that applies if the aggregate of all loans outstanding under the Credit Facility equals or exceeds 50% of the total commitment under the facility. Changes in credit ratings could lower or raise the fees that we pay under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, the maintenance of a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization, as defined in the Credit Facility, of not more than 60% at the end of each fiscal quarter and limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations, liquidation and dissolution, changes in lines of business, swap agreements, transactions with affiliates and subsidiary indebtedness. Based on our current credit ratings at December 31, 2007, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans would have been 0.24%. As of December 31, 2007, there were no loans outstanding under the Credit Facility; however $54.2 million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the Credit Facility. Liquidity and Capital Requirements Our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements. We determine the amount of cash required to meet our capital commitments by evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, including water depth and drilling capability upgrades. We believe that our operating cash flows and cash reserves will be sufficient to meet both our working capital requirements and our capital commitments over the next twelve months; however, we will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions and will adjust capital spending programs if required. In addition, we may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. Our ability to effect any such issuance will be dependent on our results of operations, our current financial condition, current market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Additionally, we may also make use of our Credit Facility to finance capital expenditures or for other general corporate purposes. 44 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Obligations. The following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2007. Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years (In thousands) Long term debt (principal and interest) $ 683,657 $ 28,642 $ 54,401 $ 50,125 $ 550,489 Forward exchange contracts 18,142 18,142 Purchase obligations related to rig upgrade/modifications 198,752 198,752 Operating leases 5,584 4,353 1,085 146 Total obligations $ 906,135 $ 249,889 $ 55,486 $ 50,271 $ 550,489 As of December 31, 2007, the total unrecognized tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions was $34.5 million. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with the liabilities recognized in this balance, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Certain of our long term debt payments may be accelerated due to certain rights that holders of our debt securities have to put the securities to us. See the discussion below related to our 1.5% Debentures and Zero Coupon Debentures. As of December 31, 2007, we had purchase obligations aggregating approximately $200 million related to the major upgrade of the Ocean Monarch and construction of two new jack up rigs, the Ocean Scepter and Ocean Shield. We expect to complete funding of these projects in 2008. However, the actual timing of these expenditures will vary based on the completion of various construction milestones, which are generally beyond our control. We had no other purchase obligations for major rig upgrades or any other significant obligations at December 31, 2007, except for those related to our direct rig operations, which arise during the normal course of business. Other Commercial Commitments Letters of Credit. We were contingently liable as of December 31, 2007 in the amount of $168.0 million under certain performance, bid, supersedeas and custom bonds and letters of credit, including $54.2 million in letters of credit issued under our Credit Facility. During 2007 and 2006, we purchased five of these bonds totaling $81.2 million from a related party after obtaining competitive quotes. Agreements relating to approximately $103.5 million of performance bonds can require collateral at any time. As of December 31, 2007 we had not been required to make any collateral deposits with respect to these agreements. The remaining agreements cannot require collateral except in events of default. On our behalf, banks have issued letters of credit securing certain of these bonds. See Note 13 Related Party Transactions to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. The table below provides a list of these obligations in U.S. dollar equivalents and their time to expiration. For the years ending December 31, Total 2008 2009 2010 (In thousands) Other Commercial Commitments Customs bonds $ 42,056 $ 42,056 $ Performance bonds 114,794 36,148 78,646 Other 11,127 3,850 7,277 Total obligations $ 167,977 $ 82,054 $ 85,923 45 Table of Contents 4.875% Senior Notes. On June 14, 2005, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes at an offering price of 99.785% of the principal amount, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $247.6 million. These notes bear interest at 4.875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year and mature on July 1, 2015. The 4.875% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. We have the right to redeem all or a portion of the 4.875% Senior Notes for cash at any time or from time to time on at least 15 days but not more than 60 days prior written notice, at the redemption price specified in the governing indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. 5.15% Senior Notes. On August 27, 2004, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.15% Senior Notes Due September 1, 2014, or 5.15% Senior Notes, at an offering price of 99.759% of the principal amount, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $247.6 million. These notes bear interest at 5.15% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year and mature on September 1, 2014. The 5.15% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. We have the right to redeem all or a portion of the 5.15% Senior Notes for cash at any time or from time to time on at least 15 days but not more than 60 days prior written notice, at the redemption price specified in the governing indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. 1.5% Debentures. On April 11, 2001, we issued $460.0 million principal amount of 1.5% Debentures, which are due April 15, 2031. The 1.5% Debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 20.3978 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures, or $49.02 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we have the right to deliver cash in lieu of shares of our common stock. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their outstanding 1.5% Debentures on April 15, 2008, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. In addition, we have the option to redeem all or a portion of the 1.5% Debentures at any time on or after April 15, 2008 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. See 1.5% Debentures in Note 9 Long Term Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The 1.5% Debentures are senior unsecured obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. During 2007 and 2006, the holders of $456.4 million and $20,000, respectively, in principal amount of our 1.5% Debentures elected to convert their outstanding debentures into shares of our common stock, resulting in the issuance of 9,309,616 shares and 404 shares of our common stock in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Zero Coupon Debentures. We issued our Zero Coupon Debentures on June 6, 2000 at a price of $499.60 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which represents a yield to maturity of 3.50% per year. The Zero Coupon Debentures mature on June 6, 2020, and, as of December 31, 2007, the aggregate accreted value of our outstanding Zero Coupon Debentures was $3.9 million. We will not pay interest prior to maturity unless we elect to convert the Zero Coupon Debentures to interest bearing debentures upon the occurrence of certain tax events. The Zero Coupon Debentures are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into our common stock at a fixed conversion rate of 8.6075 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of Zero Coupon Debentures, subject to adjustments in certain events. See Zero Coupon Debentures in Note 9 Long Term Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The Zero Coupon Debentures are senior unsecured obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. During 2007 and 2006, holders of $1.5 million and $13.7 million, respectively, in accreted, or carrying, value through the date of conversion of our Zero Coupon Debentures elected to convert their outstanding debentures into shares of our common stock. We issued 20,658 and 193,147 shares of our common stock upon conversion of these debentures during 2007 and 2006, respectively. The aggregate principal amount at maturity of our Zero Coupon Debentures converted during 2007 and 2006 was $2.4 million and $22.4 million, respectively. 46 Table of Contents Credit Ratings. Our current credit rating is Baa1 for Moodys Investors Services and A for Standard Poors. Although our long term ratings continue at investment grade levels, lower ratings would result in higher rates for borrowings under our Credit Facility and could also result in higher interest rates on future debt issuances. Capital Expenditures. The newly upgraded Ocean Endeavor commenced drilling operations in the GOM in early July 2007. The aggregate cost of the upgrade was approximately $248 million of which $38.8 million was spent in 2007. In addition, the upgrade of the Ocean Monarch continues in Singapore with expected delivery of the upgraded rig late in the fourth quarter of 2008. We expect to spend approximately $305 million to modernize this rig of which $181.4 million had been spent through December 31, 2007. Construction of our two high performance, premium jack up rigs, the Ocean Scepter and Ocean Shield is nearing completion, and delivery of both units is expected in the second quarter of 2008. The aggregate expected cost for both rigs is approximately $320 million, including drill pipe and capitalized interest, of which $248.5 million had been spent through December 31, 2007. During 2007, we spent approximately $388.4 million on our continuing rig capital maintenance program (other than rig upgrades and new construction) and to meet other corporate capital expenditure requirements, including $62.9 million towards modification of certain of our rigs to meet contractual requirements. We have budgeted approximately $500 million in additional capital expenditures in 2008 associated with our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, equipment required for our long term international contracts and other corporate requirements. We expect to finance our 2008 capital expenditures through the use of our existing cash balances or internally generated funds. From time to time, however, we may also make use of our Credit Facility to finance capital expenditures. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had no off balance sheet debt or other arrangements. Current Credit Environment. Recent developments in the financial markets, including a series of rating agency downgrades of sub prime U.S. mortgage related assets and significant provisions for loan losses recorded by several major financial institutions, have caused the fair value of sub prime related investments to decline. This decline in fair value has become especially problematic for certain large financial institutions and has had an effect through the U.S. economy, including limiting access to capital markets to certain borrowers at reasonable rates and also affecting the market value of certain investments whether or not linked to sub prime mortgages. The fair value of our investments in debt securities, comprised of U.S. government securities or U.S. government backed mortgage securities, have not to date been materially negatively impacted by events in the current credit market. However, we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not any such investments will be impacted in the future or how our customers and or suppliers will be affected by the current credit conditions. We believe that our cash flows from operations and cash reserves will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and capital projects for the next twelve months; however, we may also make use of our Credit Facility to finance capital expenditures or for other general corporate purposes. Our Credit Facility matures in 2011. We do not anticipate that these current credit market conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 47 Table of Contents Historical Cash Flows The following is a discussion of our historical cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change (In thousands) Net income $ 846,541 $ 706,847 $ 139,694 Net changes in operating assets and liabilities 139,253 (154,068 ) 293,321 (Gain) loss on sale of marketable securities (1,796 ) 31 (1,827 ) Depreciation and other non cash items, net 224,318 207,279 17,039 $ 1,208,316 $ 760,089 $ 448,227 Our cash flows from operations in 2007 increased $448.2 million or 59% over net cash generated by our operating activities in 2006. The increase in cash flow from operations in 2007 is primarily the result of higher average dayrates by our rigs as a result of continued high worldwide demand for offshore contract drilling services in 2007 compared to 2006. The favorable contribution to cash flows was partially offset by lower utilization of our offshore drilling units due to planned downtime for modifications to our rigs to meet customer requirements and regulatory surveys, as well as the ready stacking of rigs within our GOM jack up fleet between wells. In addition, the increase in cash flows from operations was augmented by a decrease in cash required to satisfy our working capital requirements. Trade and other receivables generated cash of $43.5 million during 2007 as the billing cycle for our trade receivables was completed compared to a $190.1 million usage of cash during 2006. During 2007, we also received insurance proceeds of $51.2 million related to the settlement of certain claims arising from the 2005 hurricanes (total insurance proceeds of $56.1 million were received of which $4.9 million is included as a reduction in net cash used in investing activities.) During 2007, we made estimated U.S. federal and state income tax payments and paid foreign income taxes, net of refunds, of $299.6 million and $31.7 million, respectively. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change (In thousands) Purchase of marketable securities $ (2,850,135 ) $ (2,472,431 ) $ (377,704 ) Proceeds from sale of marketable securities 3,163,475 2,187,766 975,709 Capital expenditures (647,101 ) (551,237 ) (95,864 ) Proceeds from disposition of assets 10,861 4,731 6,130 Proceeds from settlement of forward contracts 8,109 7,289 820 $ (314,791 ) $ (823,882 ) $ 509,091 Our investing activities used $314.8 million in 2007, as compared to $823.9 million in 2006. During 2007, we sold marketable securities, net of purchases, of $313.3 million compared to net purchases of $284.7 million during 2006. Our level of investment activity is dependent on our working capital and other capital requirements during the year, as well as a response to actual or anticipated events or conditions in the securities markets. During 2007, we spent approximately $258.7 million related to the major upgrades of the Ocean Endeavor and Ocean Monarch and construction of the Ocean Scepter and Ocean Shield compared to $278.0 million during 2006. Expenditures for our ongoing capital maintenance programs, including rig modifications to meet contractual requirements, were $388.4 million in 2007 compared to $273.2 million in 2006. The increase in expenditures related to our ongoing capital maintenance program in 2007 compared to 2006 is related to an increase in discretionary funds available for capital spending in 2007, as well as a response to customer requirements. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures. 48 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2007, we had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding, which aggregated $18.1 million, that require us to purchase the equivalent of $17.9 million in British pounds sterling and $0.2 million in Mexican pesos at various times through April 2008. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change (In thousands) Payment of dividends $ (796,292 ) $ (258,155 ) $ (538,137 ) Proceeds from stock options exercised 10,836 3,263 7,573 Other 5,194 793 4,401 $ (780,262 ) $ (254,099 ) $ (526,163 ) During 2007, we paid cash dividends totaling $796.3 million (consisting of quarterly cash dividends aggregating $69.3 million, or $0.125 per share of our common stock per quarter, and special cash dividends of $4.00 and $1.25 per share of our common stock, totaling $553.4 million and $173.6 million, respectively). During 2006, we paid cash dividends totaling $258.2 million (consisting of quarterly dividends of $64.6 million in the aggregate, or $0.125 per share of our common stock per quarter, and a special cash dividend of $1.50 per share of our common stock, totaling $193.6 million). On February 6, 2008, we declared a regular quarterly cash dividend and a special cash dividend of $0.125 and $1.25, respectively, per share of our common stock. Both the quarterly and special cash dividends are payable on March 3, 2008 to stockholders of record on February 18, 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2007, our Board of Directors adopted a policy of considering paying special cash dividends, in amounts to be determined, on a quarterly basis, rather than annually. Our Board of Directors may, in subsequent quarters, consider paying additional special cash dividends, in amounts to be determined, if it believes that our financial position, earnings, earnings outlook, capital spending plans and other relevant factors warrant such action at that time. Depending on market conditions, we may, from time to time, purchase shares of our common stock in the open market or otherwise. We did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Other Currency Risk. Some of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their operations in the local currency of the country where they conduct operations. Currency environments in which we have significant business operations include Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Australia and Malaysia. When possible, we attempt to minimize our currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to our estimated operating costs payable in local currency with the balance of the contract payable in U.S. dollars. At present, however, only a limited number of our contracts are payable both in U.S. dollars and the local currency. We also utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce our forward exchange risk. A forward currency exchange contract obligates a contract holder to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specific dates. We record currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses as Other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The effect on our results of operations from these translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses has not been material and are not expected to have a significant effect in the future. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, or SFAS 159, which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies that 49 Table of Contents choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. Accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, have required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings. The objective of SFAS 159 is to help mitigate this type of volatility in the earnings by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value, which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We have completed our evaluation of the impact of applying SFAS 159 on our financial statements and have determined that the adoption of SFAS 159 will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, or SFAS 157, which establishes a separate framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 was issued to eliminate the diversity in practice that exists due to the different definitions of fair value and the limited guidance for applying those definitions in GAAP that are dispersed among the many accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements; however, its adoption may result in changes to current practice. Changes resulting from the application of SFAS 157 relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement, rather than an entity specific measurement. It also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (i) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources and (ii) the reporting entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We have completed our evaluation of the impact of applying SFAS 157 on our financial statements and have determined that the adoption of SFAS 157 will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Forward Looking Statements We or our representatives may, from time to time, make or incorporate by reference certain written or oral statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward looking statements.

Statements made by us in this report that contain forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations and statements about the following subjects: future market conditions and the effect of such conditions on our future results of operations (see Overview Industry Conditions); future uses of and requirements for financial resources (see Liquidity and Capital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources); interest rate and foreign exchange risk (see Liquidity and Capital Requirements Credit Ratings and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk); future contractual obligations (see Overview Industry Conditions, Business Operations Outside the United States and Liquidity and Capital Requirements); future operations outside the United States including, without limitation, our operations in Mexico (see Overview Industry Conditions and Risk Factors); business strategy; growth opportunities; competitive position; expected financial position; future cash flows (see Overview Contract Drilling Backlog); future regular or special dividends (see Historical Cash Flows and Market for the Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Dividend Policy); financing plans; 50 Table of Contents tax planning (See Overview Critical Accounting Estimates Income Taxes, Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 Income Tax Expense and Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 Income Tax Expense); budgets for capital and other expenditures (see Liquidity and Capital Requirements); timing and cost of completion of rig upgrades and other capital projects (see Liquidity and Capital Requirements); delivery dates and drilling contracts related to rig conversion and upgrade projects (see Overview Industry Conditions and Liquidity and Capital Requirements); plans and objectives of management; performance of contracts (see Overview Industry Conditions and Risk Factors); outcomes of legal proceedings; compliance with applicable laws; and adequacy of insurance or indemnification (see Risk Factors). These types of statements inherently are subject to a variety of assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected, projected or expressed in forward looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, among others, the following: general economic and business conditions; worldwide demand for oil and natural gas; changes in foreign and domestic oil and gas exploration, development and production activity; oil and natural gas price fluctuations and related market expectations; the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and pricing, and the level of production in non OPEC countries; policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of oil and gas reserves; advances in exploration and development technology; the worldwide political and military environment, including in oil producing regions; casualty losses; operating hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore; industry fleet capacity; market conditions in the offshore contract drilling industry, including dayrates and utilization levels; competition; changes in foreign, political, social and economic conditions; risks of international operations, compliance with foreign laws and taxation policies and expropriation or nationalization of equipment and assets; risks of potential contractual liabilities pursuant to our various drilling contracts in effect from time to time; the risk that an LOI may not result in a definitive agreement; foreign exchange and currency fluctuations and regulations, and the inability to repatriate income or capital; risks of war, military operations, other armed hostilities, terrorist acts and embargoes; changes in offshore drilling technology, which could require significant capital expenditures in order to maintain competitiveness; regulatory initiatives and compliance with governmental regulations; compliance with environmental laws and regulations; development and exploitation of alternative fuels; customer preferences; effects of litigation; cost, availability and adequacy of insurance; the risk that future regular or special dividends may not be declared; adequacy of our sources of liquidity; the availability of qualified personnel to operate and service our drilling rigs; and various other matters, many of which are beyond our control. The risks and uncertainties included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report and our other filings 51 Table of Contents with the SEC include additional factors that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial performance. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. Forward looking statements included in this report speak only as of the date of this report. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations with regard to the statement or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward looking statement is based. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The information included in this Item 7A is considered to constitute forward looking statements for purposes of the statutory safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements in Item 7 of this report. Our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments. Market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. We believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur. Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by our senior management. Senior management approves the overall investment strategy that we employ and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to us. We may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. Our investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities. We monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates. The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity. The analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period. The sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly, the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our earnings or stockholders equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Loans under our $285 million syndicated, five year senior unsecured revolving Credit Facility bear interest at our option at a rate per annum equal to (i) the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin, varying from 0.20% to 0.525%, based on our current credit ratings. As of and December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were no loans outstanding under the Credit Facility (however, as of December 31, 2007, $54.2 million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the Credit Facility). 52 Table of Contents Our long term debt, as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates, and as such, interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of $35.8 million and $270.8 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A 100 basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of $11.6 million and $33.0 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. During 2007 and 2006, we entered into various foreign currency forward exchange contracts that required us to purchase predetermined amounts of foreign currencies at predetermined dates. As of December 31, 2007, we had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding, which aggregated $18.1 million, that require us to purchase the equivalent of $17.9 million in British pounds sterling and $0.2 million in Mexican pesos at various times through April 2008. As of December 31, 2006, we had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding, which aggregated $22.5 million, that required us to purchase the equivalent of $5.7 million in Brazilian reais, $2.7 million in British pounds sterling, $10.3 million in Mexican pesos and $3.8 million in Norwegian kroner at various times through June 2007. At December 31, 2007, we have presented the $2,000 and $(93,000) fair value of our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities, as Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Accrued liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report. We have presented the $2.6 million fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts at December 31, 2006 as Prepaid expenses and other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 or this report. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their levels at December 31, 2007 and 2006. The following table presents our exposure to market risk by category (interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates): Fair Value Asset (Liability) Market Risk December 31, December 31, 2007 2006 2007 2006 (In thousands) Interest rate: Marketable securities $ 1,301 (a) $ 301,159 (a) $ 100 (c) $ 400 (c) Long term debt (500,303 ) (b) (1,231,689 ) (b) Foreign Exchange: Forward exchange contracts 2 (d) 2,600 (d) 100 (e) 7,400 (e) Forward exchange contracts (93 ) (d) (d) 3,300 (e) (e) (a) The fair market value of our investment in marketable securities, excluding repurchase agreements, is based on the quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2007 and 2006.
