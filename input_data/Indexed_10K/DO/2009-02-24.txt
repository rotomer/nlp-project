Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements (including the Notes thereto) in Item 8 of this report. We provide contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe and are a leader in offshore drilling with a fleet of 45 offshore drilling rigs. Our fleet currently consists of 30 semisubmersibles, 14 jack ups and one drillship. Overview Industry Conditions The global economic recession significantly reduced energy demand in the fourth quarter of 2008 and into the first quarter of 2009. As a result, crude oil prices have fallen from a 2008 mid summer high of $146 per barrel to as low as $34 per barrel in mid February 2009, and remain volatile. With the falling energy prices, project economics for our customers have deteriorated, 2009 exploration budgets have been trimmed, and demand and pricing for available drilling rigs is declining. Our contract backlog should help mitigate the impact of the current market on us; however, a prolonged decline in commodity prices and the global economy could have a negative impact on us. Possible negative impacts, among others, could include customer credit problems, customers seeking bankruptcy protection, customers attempting to renegotiate or terminate contracts, a further slowing in the pace of new contracting activity, additional declines in dayrates for new contracts, declines in utilization and the stacking of idle equipment. Floaters The majority of our intermediate and high specification floater rigs are largely contracted for the remainder of 2009. Additionally, contracts for 71% of our floating rigs extend at least through 2010, with 9% of our floating units having contracts extending into the 2014 2015 timeframe. However, during the first quarter of 2009 a customer employing our semisubmersible Ocean Guardian in the United Kingdom, or U.K., sector of the North Sea entered into administration under U.K. law (a U.K. insolvency proceeding similar to U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization but with an external manager, typically an accountant, running the company). The rig, which was operating under a contract that extends until September 2011, is currently on standby and is not earning revenue. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, or GOM, during the fourth quarter of 2008, a customer breached its contract with us and canceled the second well of a two well project for the semisubmersible Ocean Victory. We were able to re contract the rig, albeit at a lower dayrate, to fill the resulting short gap until a previously committed job is scheduled to begin. We are continuing to pursue appropriate contractual remedies with both customers. International Jack ups The industrys jack up market is divided between an international sector and a U.S. sector, with the international sector generally characterized by contracts of longer duration and higher prices, compared to the generally shorter term and lower priced domestic sector. However, in 2009 to the date of this report, demand and dayrates have continued to soften internationally. Based on analyst reports to the effect that less than 20% of the industrys new build jack up order book is under contract, it is possible that an oversupply of jack up rigs will have an increasingly negative impact on the international sector during 2009 and beyond. U.S. Gulf of Mexico Jack ups In the domestic jack up sector, rapidly declining product prices have negatively impacted both demand and dayrates. In response, where possible we are continuing to seek to move units out of the GOM and into markets with generally longer contract duration and higher prices. In that regard, we were low bidder for a 476 day job for the 300 ft. Ocean Summit and for an 849 day extension for the 300 ft. Ocean Nugget. Both bids are for work offshore Mexico and remain subject to final approvals. Absent improving product prices, weakness in the GOM is likely to continue in 2009, with an increasing number of rigs being cold stacked by the industry in an effort to help bring equipment supply and demand into equilibrium. 20 Table of Contents Contract Drilling Backlog The following table reflects our contract drilling backlog as of February 5, 2009, October 23, 2008 (the date reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2008) and February 7, 2008 (the date reported in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2007) and for the 2008 periods includes both firm commitments (typically represented by signed contracts), as well as previously disclosed letters of intent, or LOIs, where indicated. An LOI is subject to customary conditions, including the execution of a definitive agreement, and as such may not result in a binding contract. Contract drilling backlog is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period and adding one half of any potential rig performance bonuses. Our calculation also assumes full utilization of our drilling equipment for the contract period (excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days); however, the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors. Utilization rates, which generally approach 95 98% during contracted periods, can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including, but not limited to, weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance. Contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and customer reimbursables. No revenue is generally earned during periods of downtime for regulatory surveys. Changes in our contract drilling backlog between periods are a function of the performance of work on term contracts, as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts.

Casualty Loss In September 2008, the jack up rig Ocean Tower sustained significant damage during Hurricane Ike, which impacted the Gulf of Mexico and the upper Texas and Louisiana Gulf coasts. The Ocean Tower lost its derrick, drill floor and drill floor equipment during the hurricane. During the third quarter of 2008, we wrote off the net book value of the derrick, drill floor and drill floor equipment for the Ocean Tower of approximately $2.6 million and accrued $3.7 million in estimated salvage costs for the recovery of equipment from the ocean floor. The aggregate of these items is reflected in Casualty Loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in Item 8 of this report. In December 2008, we entered into an agreement to sell the Ocean Tower at a price in excess of its $32.2 million carrying value and transferred the $32.2 million net book value of the rig to Assets held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report. The agreement prohibits competitive use of the rig, which is expected to be deployed by the purchaser as an accommodation unit. We do not expect the sale of the Ocean Tower to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or our ability to compete in the jack up market. In connection with the execution of the sales agreement, we received a $3.5 million deposit from the purchaser which we have recorded in Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008 included in Item 8 of this report. We expect to complete the sale in the first quarter of 2009. General The two most significant variables affecting revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates, each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace. Demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development, as well as a variety of political and economic factors. The availability of rigs in a particular geographical region also affects both dayrates and utilization rates. These factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict. Demand affects the number of days our fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned. As utilization rates increase, dayrates tend to increase as well, reflecting the lower supply of available rigs. Conversely, as utilization rates decrease, dayrates tend to decrease as well, reflecting the excess supply of rigs. When a rig is idle, no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result. Revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs, required surveys and shipyard upgrades. In order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates, we may mobilize our rigs from one market to another. However, during periods of mobilization, revenues may be adversely affected. As a response to changes in demand, we may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously, which may decrease or increase revenues, respectively. We recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed. In connection with such drilling contracts, we may receive fees (either lump sum or dayrate) for the mobilization of equipment. We earn these fees as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. We defer mobilization fees received, as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred, and amortize each, on a straight line basis, over the term of the related drilling contracts (which is the period estimated to be benefited from the mobilization activity). Straight line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts (which generally range from two to 60 months) is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed. Absent a contract, mobilization costs are recognized currently. From time to time, we may receive fees from our customers for capital improvements to our rigs (either lump sum or dayrate). We defer such fees and recognize them into income on a straight line basis over the period of the related drilling contract as a component of contract drilling revenue. We capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of the improvement. We receive reimbursements for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services and other services provided at the request of our customers in accordance with a contract or agreement. We record these reimbursements at the gross amount billed to the customer, as Revenues related to reimbursable expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in Item 8 of this report. 22 Table of Contents Operating Income. Our operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors, but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses. Our operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling equipment. The principal components of our operating costs are, among other things, direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory inspections, boat and helicopter rentals and insurance. Labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most significant components of our operating expenses. In general, our labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels, rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which our rigs operate. In recent years, we have experienced upward pressure on salaries and wages as a result of the strong offshore drilling market during this period and increased competition for skilled workers. In response to these market conditions we have implemented retention programs, including increases in compensation. Costs to repair and maintain our equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing, as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the regions in which our rigs are working. Operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates, and short term reductions in utilization do not necessarily result in lower operating expenses. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or ready stacked state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract. However, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, we may reduce the size of a rigs crew and take steps to cold stack the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income. We recognize, as incurred, operating expenses related to activities such as inspections, painting projects and routine overhauls that meet certain criteria and which maintain rather than upgrade our rigs. These expenses vary from period to period. Costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements. Higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades. Periods of high, sustained utilization may result in cost increases for maintenance and repairs in order to maintain our equipment in proper, working order. In addition, during periods of high activity and dayrates, higher prices generally pervade the entire offshore drilling industry and its support businesses, which cause our costs for goods and services to increase. Our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections, which we refer to as a 5 year survey, or special survey, that are due every five years for each of our rigs. Operating revenue decreases because these surveys are performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard. Operating expenses increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs. Repair and maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of rigs undergoing a 5 year survey will vary from year to year, as well as from quarter to quarter. In addition, operating income may be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim periods between 5 year surveys. Intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a 5 year survey. Although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the drilling rig, it normally does not require dry docking or shipyard time, except for rigs located in the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. During 2009, five of our rigs will require 5 year surveys, and we expect that they will be out of service for approximately 300 days in the aggregate. We also expect to spend an additional approximately 950 days during 2009 for intermediate surveys, the mobilization of rigs, contract modifications for international contracts and extended maintenance projects. In addition, we expect the Ocean Bounty to be taken out of service at some time after the first quarter of 2009 for a repowering project and minor water depth upgrade. We expect these projects to take approximately one year to complete and to extend to 2010. We can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and or duration of downtime associated with regulatory inspections, planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects. See Overview Contract Drilling Backlog. Under our current insurance policy that expires on May 1, 2009, our deductible for physical damage is $75.0 million per occurrence (or lower for some rigs if they are declared a constructive total loss) in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to named windstorms with an annual aggregate limit of $125.0 million. Accordingly, our insurance coverage for all physical damage to our rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for the policy period ending May 1, 2009 is limited to $125.0 million. If named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of 23 Table of Contents Mexico cause significant damage to our rigs, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Insurance premiums are amortized as expense over the applicable policy periods which generally expire at the end of April 2009. Construction and Capital Upgrade Projects. We capitalize interest cost for the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost, or SFAS 34. Pursuant to SFAS 34, the period of interest capitalization covers the duration of the activities required to make the asset ready for its intended use, and the capitalization period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. For the three years ended December 31, 2008, we capitalized interest on qualifying expenditures related to the upgrades of the Ocean Endeavor and Ocean Monarch for ultra deepwater service and the construction of two jack up rigs, the Ocean Shield and Ocean Scepter through the date of each projects completion. The upgrades of the Ocean Endeavor and Ocean Monarch were completed in March 2007 and December 2008, respectively. Construction of the Ocean Shield and Ocean Scepter was completed in May 2008 and August 2008, respectively. As a result of the delivery of these rigs in 2008, we anticipate that depreciation and interest expense in 2009 will increase by approximately $17 million and $16 million, respectively, compared to 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 General Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Judgments, assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies. We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows: Property, Plant and Equipment. We carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost. Maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments, which meet certain criteria, are capitalized. Depreciation is amortized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives. Our management makes judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization, useful lives and salvage values. Changes in these judgments, assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported. We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We utilize a probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. Our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following: dayrate by rig; utilization rate by rig (expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used); the per day operating cost for each rig if active, ready stacked or cold stacked; and salvage value for each rig. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we develop a matrix by assigning probabilities to various combinations of assumed utilization rates and dayrates. We also consider the impact of a 5% reduction in assumed dayrates for the cold stacked rigs (holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant), or alternatively the impact of a 5% reduction in utilization (again holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant) as part of our analysis. As of December 31, 2008, all, except for two, of our drilling rigs were either under contract, in shipyards for surveys or contract modifications or, in the case of the recently upgraded Ocean Monarch, mobilizing to the U.S. One of these idle units, the Ocean Tower, which was damaged during Hurricane Ike in September 2008, has been transferred to Assets held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2008 included in Item 8 of this report. We have entered into an agreement to sell the rig for a price in excess of its carrying value. At December 31, 2008, the second of our idle rigs was ready stacked while waiting to begin drilling operations in early January 2009. We did not have any cold stacked rigs at December 31, 2008. We do not believe that current circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our property and equipment may not be recoverable. 24 Table of Contents Managements assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. Personal Injury Claims. Our deductible for liability coverage for personal injury claims, which primarily result from Jones Act liability in the Gulf of Mexico, is $5.0 million per occurrence, with no aggregate deductible. The Jones Act is a federal law that permits seamen to seek compensation for certain injuries during the course of their employment on a vessel and governs the liability of vessel operators and marine employers for the work related injury or death of an employee. We estimate our aggregate reserve for personal injury claims based on our historical losses and utilizing various actuarial models. The eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from our estimated amounts due to uncertainties such as: the severity of personal injuries claimed; significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims; the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated; inconsistent court decisions; and the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, or SFAS 109, which requires the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable, respectively, on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if necessary, which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach. For interim periods, we estimate our annual effective tax rate by forecasting our annual income before income tax, taxable income and tax expense in each of our tax jurisdictions. We make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to forecasting of our effective tax rate, the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits, and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit. We adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, or FIN 48, on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognized a long term tax receivable of $2.6 million and a long term tax liability of $19.3 million for uncertain tax positions (excluding interest and penalties), the net of which was accounted for as a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. 25 Table of Contents Results of Operations Although we perform contract drilling services with different types of drilling rigs and in many geographic locations, there is a similarity of economic characteristics among all our divisions and locations, including the nature of services provided and the type of customers for our services. We believe that the combination of our drilling rigs into one reportable segment is the appropriate aggregation in accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. However, for purposes of this discussion and analysis of our results of operations, we provide greater detail with respect to the types of rigs in our fleet and the geographic regions in which they operate to enhance the readers understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the growing global economic recession became apparent in our industry, resulting in reduced demand for energy and a significant decline in crude oil prices. However, because of our contracted revenue backlog, our results were not greatly impacted by these market conditions during the fourth quarter of 2008. The high overall utilization and historically high dayrates for our floater fleet contributed to an overall increase in our revenues of $891.9 million, or 43%, to $3.0 billion in 2008 compared to $2.1 billion in 2007. Total contract drilling revenues in 2008 increased $970.8 million, or 39% compared to 2007, to $3.5 billion. Average realized dayrates in many of our floater markets increased as our rigs began operating under contracts at higher dayrates than those earned during 2007, resulting in the generation of additional contract drilling revenues. However, overall revenue increases for our floater fleet were negatively impacted by the effect of downtime associated with scheduled shipyard projects and mandatory inspections or surveys. In addition, the GOM jack up market, which was improving in early 2008, began experiencing reduced demand and dayrates by the end of 2008. The international jack up market, which had been strong throughout the majority of 2008, also began to reflect softening demand and reduced dayrates by the end of 2008. Our GOM and international jack up fleets earned lower dayrates during 2008 compared to 2007 despite a fleet wide increase in utilization during 2008. Total contract drilling expenses increased $181.2 million, or 18%, in 2008 compared to 2007. Overall cost increases for maintenance and repairs between the 2008 and 2007 periods reflect the impact of high, sustained utilization of our drilling units across our fleet, additional survey and related maintenance costs, contract preparation and mobilization costs, as well as the inclusion of normal operating costs for the Ocean Endeavor, Ocean Shield and Ocean Scepter. The increase in overall operating and overhead costs also reflects the impact of higher prices throughout the offshore drilling industry and its support businesses, including higher costs associated with hiring and retaining skilled personnel for our worldwide offshore fleet. Depreciation expense increased $51.6 million to $286.9 million during 2008, or 22% compared to 2007, due to a higher depreciable asset base. Our results during 2008 were negatively impacted by $54.0 million in losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts included in Foreign currency transaction gain (loss), a $31.9 million provision for bad debt expense related to one of our North Sea semisubmersible rigs contracted to a U.K. customer that has entered into administration under U.K. law (a U.K. insolvency proceeding similar to U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy) and the recognition of a casualty loss aggregating $6.3 million in connection with damages sustained from Hurricane Ike (see Overview Casualty Loss). 27 Table of Contents High Specification Floaters.

Revenues generated by our high specification floaters operating in the GOM increased $217.4 million in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to higher average dayrates earned during 2008 ($131.7 million). Average operating revenue per day for our rigs in this market, excluding the Ocean Endeavor, increased to $413,300 during 2008 compared to $354,400 in 2007. Excluding the Ocean Endeavor, six of our seven other high specification semisubmersible rigs in the GOM are currently operating at dayrates higher than those earned during 2007. The Ocean Endeavor began operating in the GOM during the third quarter of 2007 and generated additional revenues of $49.7 million during 2008 compared to 2007. Average utilization for our high specification rigs operating in the GOM, excluding the Ocean Endeavor, increased slightly from 87% in 2007 to 91% in 2008, generating $36.0 million in additional revenues in 2008. The increase in utilization in 2008 is attributable to 88 fewer downtime days during 2008 compared to 2007 when rigs were down, primarily for regulatory inspections and repairs. Operating costs during 2008 for our high specification floaters in the GOM increased $17.6 million to $224.0 million (including $11.3 million in incremental operating expenses for the Ocean Endeavor) compared to 2007. Operating costs for 2008 reflect higher labor, benefits and other personnel related costs, higher maintenance and other project costs and higher property insurance costs, partially offset by lower mobilization and other inspection related costs for these rigs compared to 2007. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Revenues generated by the Ocean Rover, our high specification rig operating offshore Malaysia, decreased $3.6 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The revenue decrease was primarily due to scheduled downtime (67 days) for a survey and maintenance, partially offset by the effect of a higher average dayrate earned during 2008 compared to 2007. Contract drilling expenses for the Ocean Rover increased $8.7 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to costs associated with the rigs 2008 survey and other maintenance and repair costs and, to a lesser extent, higher labor, benefits and other personnel related costs. South America. Revenues earned by our high specification floaters operating offshore Brazil during 2008 increased $77.4 million compared to 2007. Average operating revenue per day increased from $185,300 during 2007 to $339,700 during 2008, generating additional revenues of $92.3 million. Utilization in 2008 decreased to 81% from 92% in 2007 primarily as the result of 99 days of incremental unpaid downtime for the Ocean Clipper for a special survey and repairs to its propulsion system. The decline in utilization reduced revenues by $14.9 million in 2008. 28 Table of Contents Contract drilling expense for our operations in Brazil increased $22.7 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in costs is primarily due to inspection and repair costs for the Ocean Clipper and higher revenue based agency fees and personnel and related costs during 2008, as compared to 2007. Intermediate Semisubmersibles.

Revenues generated during 2008 by our intermediate semisubmersible fleet operating in the GOM decreased $35.6 million compared to 2007, primarily as a result of the relocation of three of our rigs from the GOM (Ocean Voyager and Ocean New Era to Mexico and Ocean Concord to Brazil) in the fourth quarter of 2007. During 2007, these three rigs generated revenues of $128.9 million while operating in the GOM. The negative impact on revenues of the departure of these rigs was partially offset by $65.6 million and $27.8 million in additional revenues generated by the Ocean Saratoga and the Ocean Ambassador, respectively, during 2008 compared to 2007. The additional contribution by the Ocean Saratoga was primarily due to the rig operating at a higher dayrate beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007 and increased utilization during 2008 compared to 2007 when the rig was out of service for 116 days completing a service life extension project. We relocated the Ocean Ambassador to the GOM from Mexico during the second quarter of 2008. Contract drilling expenses in the GOM decreased by $34.4 million during 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the absence of operating costs for the Ocean Voyager, Ocean New Era and Ocean Concord ($47.9 million) which relocated to other markets during 2007 and costs associated with shipyard projects for the Ocean Whittington and Ocean Worker ($16.8 million) that were completed in 2007 prior to relocating these rigs to the South America region. The overall decrease in contract drilling expenses in 2008 was partially offset by the inclusion of normal operating expenses and special survey costs for the Ocean Ambassador ($21.8 million). Also included in operating expenses for 2008 are $3.2 million in maintenance and other costs associated with contract preparation activities for the Ocean Yorktown prior to its mobilization to Brazil in May 2008. Mexico. Offshore Mexico, three of our intermediate semisubmersible rigs completed their contracts with PEMEX after the second quarter of 2007 and relocated out of the region. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we relocated two semisubmersible units, the Ocean New Era and Ocean Voyager, from the GOM to Mexico. Average operating revenue per day for our rigs working offshore Mexico increased to $277,900 for 2008 compared to $98,900 per day for 2007 primarily because these two new rigs in the region are currently working for PEMEX at dayrates substantially higher than average rates earned during 2007. Higher dayrates, partially offset by the net reduction in the number of rigs between periods, generated $134.6 million of additional revenues during 2008 compared to 2007. 29 Table of Contents Contract drilling expenses for the Mexico region decreased $9.5 million during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the effect on operating costs of the net reduction of one rig in the region, partially offset by higher maintenance costs and revenue based agency fees. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the Australia/Asia/Middle East region generated revenues of $395.1 million during 2008 compared to revenues of $239.2 million in 2007. The $155.9 million increase in operating revenue was primarily due to an increase in average operating revenue per day from $171,500 during 2007 to $306,600 during 2008, which generated additional revenues of $171.0 million during 2008. Average utilization in this region decreased to 87% during 2008 from 94% during 2007, resulting in a $15.1 million reduction in revenues during 2008. The decrease in utilization was primarily the result of 170 days of scheduled downtime for special surveys and repairs for three of our rigs in this region during 2008. Contract drilling expense for the Australia/Asia/Middle East region increased $28.5 million in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to inspection and related repair costs associated with special surveys during 2008. In addition, normal operating costs for the Ocean Patriot were higher during 2008 while operating offshore Australia compared to operating offshore New Zealand during 2007. Operating costs in this region also reflected higher labor and personnel related costs during 2008 compared to the prior year. Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. Operating revenue for our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean region increased $117.6 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to higher dayrates earned by our four rigs operating in the North Sea (both U.K. and Norwegian sectors). Average operating revenue per day for our North Sea semisubmersibles increased from $211,500 during 2007 to $321,200 during 2008, contributing $144.7 million in additional revenue in 2008 compared to the prior year. The increase in revenue was partially offset by the impact of 126 days of incremental downtime during 2008 primarily associated with surveys of our U.K. rigs. The decrease in utilization reduced revenues by $27.4 million during 2008 compared to 2007. Contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean markets increased $24.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the inclusion of costs associated with surveys of our rigs operating in the U.K. sector of the North Sea. In addition, during 2008, all of our rigs in this market incurred higher overall costs, primarily for labor and benefits and repairs. Operating costs for 2008 included additional costs for the Ocean Vanguard operating offshore Ireland for a portion of 2008. South America. Revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the South American region increased $228.1 million during 2008 compared to 2007. During 2008, we had six rigs operating in the region compared to four rigs operating in the region during 2007. Following the first quarter of 2007, we relocated the Ocean Whittington and Ocean Concord to Brazil and the Ocean Worker to Trinidad and Tobago where they generated additional aggregate revenues of $196.2 million in 2008. The Ocean Yorktown began operating in Brazil during the third quarter of 2008 and generated $30.4 million in revenues. Operating expenses for our operations in the South American region increased $89.8 million in 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating costs for two of the rigs transferred to this region ($48.1 million) and incremental operating costs for the Ocean Worker and Ocean Whittington ($38.6 million) which only operated in the South American region for a portion of 2007. Operating expenses for 2008 also reflected higher labor and other personnel related expenses, freight and repair and maintenance costs for our other two semisubmersible rigs in this market. 30 Table of Contents Jack Ups.

Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the GOM decreased $32.8 million during 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean King (Croatia) and the Ocean Columbia (Mexico) after the second quarter of 2007. These two rigs generated $42.1 million in revenues while operating in the GOM during 2007. In addition, average operating revenue per day, excluding the Ocean King and Ocean Columbia, decreased to $80,800 in 2008 from $90,500 during 2007, resulting in an additional $18.3 million decrease in revenue from the prior year. Average utilization (excluding the Ocean King and Ocean Columbia) increased from 78% during 2007 to 92% during 2008, resulting in an increase in revenues of $32.5 million. The increase in utilization was primarily due to an improvement in market conditions in the GOM during 2008 compared to 2007 that resulted in fewer ready stack days for our jack up fleet between wells during 2008 (22 days) compared to 2007 (306 days). However, revenues decreased $4.8 million as a result of the Ocean Tower being taken out of service due to damages sustained during Hurricane Ike in the third quarter of 2008, partially offsetting the favorable effect of increased utilization in 2008. Contract drilling expense in the GOM decreased $19.7 million during 2008 compared to 2007. The overall decrease in operating costs during 2008 was due to the absence of operating costs in the GOM for the Ocean King and Ocean Columbia ($21.8 million). The reduction in overall operating costs was partially offset by costs associated with a regulatory survey for one of our GOM jack ups, higher labor and benefits costs and higher overhead costs for our remaining rigs in the GOM during 2008 compared to 2007. Mexico. Revenue and contract drilling expense from our rigs operating in Mexico increased $42.6 million and $17.2 million, respectively, in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the operation of the Ocean Columbia offshore Mexico, beginning in the first quarter of 2008. The Ocean Columbia generated $42.0 million in revenues and incurred $17.1 million in operating expenses during 2008. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the Australia/Asia/Middle East region increased $4.1 million during 2008 compared to 2007. Our newly constructed jack up rig, the Ocean Shield, began operating offshore Malaysia during the second quarter of 2008 and generated $39.0 million in revenues during 2008. In addition, the Ocean Sovereign, operating offshore Indonesia in 2008, generated additional revenues of $8.4 million due to an increase in the operating dayrate earned by the rig beginning late in the second quarter of 2008. These favorable contributions to revenue in the region were partially offset by a decrease in revenue generated by the Ocean Heritage, which was ready stacked in a shipyard in Qatar from March 2008 through late June 2008 until it was subsequently relocated out of the region to Egypt. 31 Table of Contents Contract drilling expense in the Australia/Asia/Middle East region increased by $14.0 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating costs for the Ocean Shield and higher labor, benefits, repair and other operating costs for the Ocean Sovereign. These cost increases were partially offset by the absence of operating costs for the Ocean Heritage due to its relocation to Egypt. Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean region increased $42.8 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The Ocean King, operating under a two year bareboat charter offshore Croatia that began in the third quarter of 2007, generated revenues of $37.8 million during 2008. In addition, the Ocean Heritage, which relocated to Egypt during the third quarter of 2008, generated $17.0 million of revenues in the region. Revenues were negatively impacted by the Ocean Spur, which operated offshore Egypt all of 2008 and in both Tunisia and Egypt in 2007. The Ocean Spur generated $12.0 million less in revenues during 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the recognition of other operating revenues associated with its contract offshore Tunisia during 2007. Contract drilling expense in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean region increased by $15.6 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating costs for the Ocean Heritage beginning in the third quarter of 2008 and, to a lesser extent, operating expenses associated with the Ocean Kings bareboat charter for the entire 2008 period. South America. Our newly constructed jack up rig, the Ocean Scepter, began operating offshore Argentina during the third quarter of 2008 and generated $22.1 million in revenues and incurred $14.3 million in contract drilling expenses. Other Contract Drilling. Other contract drilling expenses decreased $7.8 million during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to insurance proceeds received in 2008 related to claims filed in connection with the 2005 Hurricane Katrina. These costs had previously been expensed due to uncertainty of recovery from insurance. Depreciation. Depreciation expense increased $51.6 million to $286.9 million in 2008 compared to $235.3 million in 2007 primarily due to depreciation associated with capital additions in 2007 and 2008, including a partial years depreciation of our two newly constructed jack ups, the Ocean Shield and Ocean Scepter. General and Administrative Expense. We incurred general and administrative expense of $60.1 million in 2008 compared to $53.5 million in 2007. The $6.7 million increase in overhead costs between the periods was primarily due to an increase in payroll costs resulting from higher compensation and staffing increases, travel and related costs and engineering and tax consulting fees. These cost increases were partially offset by lower legal fees resulting from an insurance reimbursement related to certain litigation in 2008. Bad Debt Expense. We recorded a provision for bad debt expense of $31.9 million related to one of our North Sea semisubmersible rigs contracted to a U.K. customer that has entered into administration under U.K. law. Casualty Loss. During September 2008, one of our jack up rigs, the Ocean Tower, sustained significant damage during Hurricane Ike. As a result of this damage, we wrote off the net book value of the Ocean Towers derrick, drill floor and related equipment lost in the storm of approximately $2.6 million and accrued $3.7 million in estimated salvage costs for recovery of equipment from the ocean floor. 32 Table of Contents Gain on Disposition of Assets. We recognized a net gain of $2.8 million on the sale and disposition of assets in 2008 compared to a net gain of $8.6 million in 2007 primarily for the recognition of gains on insurance settlements and from sales of used equipment. Interest Income. Our interest income decreased $21.8 million to $11.7 million in 2008 from $33.6 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our invested cash balances in 2008 compared to 2007. Interest Expense. We recorded interest expense of $10.1 million in 2008 compared to $19.2 million in 2007. Interest expense in 2007 included $9.2 million in debt issuance costs that we wrote off in connection with conversions during the period of our 1.5% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2031, or 1.5% Debentures, and our Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures due 2020, or Zero Coupon Debentures, into shares of our common stock. We wrote off $84,000 in debt issuance costs during 2008 related to conversions during the year. Foreign Currency Transaction Gain (Loss). Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) include gains and losses from the settlement of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and fluctuate based on the level of transactions in foreign currencies, as well as fluctuations in such currencies. During 2008, we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of $65.6 million, including $54.0 million in net losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts ($37.2 million in net unrealized losses resulting from mark to market accounting on our open positions at December 31, 2008 and $16.8 million in net realized losses on settlement of forward contracts). During 2007, we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of $2.9 million. Income Tax Expense. Our income tax expense is a function of the mix between our domestic and international pre tax earnings or losses, respectively, as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognized $536.6 million of tax expense on pre tax income of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to tax expense of $400.0 million on a pre tax income of $1.2 billion in 2007. Certain of our international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited, or DOIL, a Cayman Islands subsidiary which we wholly own. Since forming this subsidiary in 2002, it has been our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the subsidiary to finance foreign activities. Consequently, no U.S. federal income taxes were provided on these earnings in years subsequent to 2002 except to the extent that such earnings were immediately subject to U.S. federal income taxes. In December 2007, DOIL made a non recurring distribution of $850.0 million to its U.S. parent, a portion of which consisted of earnings of the subsidiary that had not previously been subjected to U.S. federal income tax. We recognized $58.6 million of U.S. federal income tax expense in 2007 as a result of the distribution. Notwithstanding the non recurring distribution made in December 2007, it remains our intention to indefinitely reinvest future earnings of DOIL to finance foreign activities except for the earnings of Diamond East Asia Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of DOIL formed in December 2008. It is our intention to repatriate the earnings of Diamond East Asia Limited and, accordingly, U.S. income taxes are provided on its earnings. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we recognized $0.8 million and $1.7 million of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions, respectively. Penalty related tax expense for uncertain tax positions during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $1.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively. 33 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 Comparative data relating to our revenue and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below.

Continued high overall utilization and historically high dayrates contributed to an overall increase in our net income of $139.7 million, or 20%, to $846.5 million in 2007 compared to $706.8 million in 2006. In many of the markets in which we operate, dayrates continued to increase compared to 2006 resulting in the generation of additional contract drilling revenues by our fleet. However, overall revenue increases were negatively impacted by the effect of downtime associated with scheduled shipyard projects and mandatory inspections or surveys, as well as the temporary ready stacking of drilling rigs between wells in the GOM jack up market. Total contract drilling revenues in 2007 increased $518.5 million, or 26%, to $2.5 billion compared to $2.0 billion in 2006. Total contract drilling expenses increased $198.4 million, or 25%, in 2007, compared to 2006, to $1.0 billion. Overall cost increases for maintenance and repairs between 2007 and 2006 reflect the impact of high, sustained utilization of our drilling units across our fleet, additional survey and related maintenance costs, contract preparation and mobilization costs, as well as the inclusion of normal operating costs for the newly upgraded Ocean Endeavor. The increase in overall operating and overhead costs also reflects the impact of higher prices throughout the offshore drilling industry and its support businesses. Our results were also impacted by higher expenses related to our mooring enhancement and other hurricane preparedness activities in 2006 and compensation increases during 2006 and 2007. Depreciation and general and administrative expenses increased $46.7 million in the aggregate, or 19%, in 2007 compared to 2006, reducing our net income by $288.7 million in 2007. Net income for 2007 includes $58.6 million of non recurring U.S. federal income tax expense related to the distribution of previously untaxed earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries.

Revenues generated by our high specification floaters operating in the GOM increased $259.2 million during 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to higher average dayrates earned during 2007 ($259.1 million). Average operating revenue per day for our rigs in this market, excluding the Ocean Endeavor, increased to $354,400 during 2007 compared to $236,600 in 2006, reflecting the continued high demand for this class of rig in the GOM. The Ocean Endeavor began operating during the third quarter of 2007 and generated revenues of $42.7 million in the GOM in 2007. Average utilization for our high specification rigs operating in the GOM, excluding the Ocean Endeavor, decreased from 94% in 2006 to 87% in 2007 and resulted in a $38.4 million decline in revenues comparing the years. The decline in utilization during the 2007 period was primarily the result of scheduled downtime for special 35 Table of Contents surveys for the Ocean Star (47 days) and Ocean Quest (66 days) and for a special survey and repairs to the Ocean Baroness (149 days). Combined utilization for these three rigs was 95% during 2006. During 2006, we recognized $4.3 million in mobilization revenue for the Ocean Baroness associated with its 2005 relocation to the GOM. Operating costs during 2007 for our high specification floaters in the GOM increased $64.2 million compared to 2006 to $206.4 million (including $16.8 million in normal operating expenses for the Ocean Endeavor). The increase in operating costs in 2007 compared to 2006 reflects higher labor, benefits and other personnel related costs resulting from compensation increases, higher maintenance and project costs and incremental costs associated with regulatory surveys for the Ocean Baroness, Ocean Star and Ocean Quest, including mobilization, inspection and related repair costs. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Revenues generated by the Ocean Rover, our high specification rig operating offshore Malaysia, increased $7.3 million during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to a higher operating dayrate earned by the rig in the first quarter and last two months of 2007. Operating expenses for the Ocean Rover in 2007 increased $2.5 million compared to 2006 to $26.4 million, primarily due to higher labor, benefits and maintenance and project costs, partially offset by lower insurance and other costs. South America. Revenues earned by our high specification floaters operating offshore Brazil decreased $2.5 million to $124.1 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to a decline in utilization ($5.8 million) resulting from 33 days of additional unpaid downtime in 2007 for a special survey for the Ocean Alliance. The decline in revenues in 2007 was partially offset by an increase in the average operating revenue per day from $180,100 during 2006 to $185,300 during 2007, which contributed additional revenues of $3.3 million. Contract drilling expense for our operations in Brazil increased $17.8 million during 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in costs was primarily due to survey costs for the Ocean Alliance, higher labor and benefits costs as a result of compensation increases, as well as higher catering, freight and maintenance and project costs during 2007 compared to 2006. 36 Table of Contents Intermediate Semisubmersibles.

Revenues generated during 2007 by our intermediate semisubmersible fleet decreased $53.9 million compared to 2006, primarily as a result of the fourth quarter 2006 relocation of the Ocean Lexington to Egypt, as well as shipyard time during 2007 for four of our other rigs in this market. During 2007, we completed a survey and contract preparation work for the Ocean Voyager, a service life extension project for the Ocean Saratoga and contract modifications for the Ocean Concord and Ocean New Era. Excluding the Ocean Lexington, average utilization for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the GOM (Ocean Voyager, Ocean Concord, Ocean New Era and Ocean Saratoga) declined from 84% in 2006 to 75% during 2007 and reduced revenues by $58.3 million. During 2006, the Ocean Lexington generated revenues of $33.4 million in the GOM. Of these rigs, only the Ocean Saratoga remained in the GOM as of December 31, 2007. The overall decline in revenues in 2007 was partially offset by an increase in average dayrates earned by our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the GOM during both 2007 and 2006. Average operating revenue per day, excluding the Ocean Lexington, increased from $155,200 during 2006 to $189,400 in 2007 and contributed additional revenues of $37.8 million. During 2006 and 2007, three of our rigs completed their contracts with PEMEX and temporarily returned to the GOM. The Ocean Whittington returned to the GOM in July 2006 for a survey, contract preparation work and a service life extension. The Ocean Yorktown and Ocean Worker returned to the GOM in July 2007 and August 2007, respectively, for surveys and contract preparation work, as well as a service life extension project for the Ocean Yorktown. All three rigs were located in shipyards in the GOM for extended periods during 2007, and we incurred additional costs in the GOM associated with these activities. During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, the Ocean Whittington and the Ocean Worker departed the GOM for Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago, respectively. Contract drilling expenses decreased by $0.7 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Increased costs in the GOM during 2007 associated with surveys and contract preparation activities, as well as higher labor and related costs,were offset by lower normal operating costs in the GOM as a result of the numerous rigs that were relocated from the region at the end of 2006 and during 2007. Mexico. Revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating offshore Mexico increased $5.6 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The relocation of the Ocean New Era and Ocean Voyager from the GOM to Mexico in the fourth quarter of 2007 generated an additional $33.3 million in revenues for this region in 2007. 37 Table of Contents Revenues generated in 2007 were reduced by $28.5 million due to the return of the Ocean Whittington in July 2006 and the Ocean Worker and Ocean Yorktown in the third quarter of 2007 to the GOM. Our operating costs in Mexico increased by $3.2 million in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the inclusion of operating costs for the Ocean New Era and Ocean Voyager and costs to mobilize the Ocean Worker and Ocean Yorktown from Mexico to the GOM. The overall increase in costs was partially offset by the absence of operating costs for the Ocean Whittington in 2007 and reduced normal operating costs for the Ocean Worker and Ocean Yorktown beginning in the third quarter of 2007. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the Australia/Asia/Middle East regions generated revenues of $239.2 million in 2007 compared to revenues of $196.2 million in 2006. The $43.0 million increase in operating revenue was primarily due to an increase in average operating revenue per day from $135,600 in 2006 to $169,900 in 2007, which generated additional revenues of $45.4 million during 2007. The increase in average operating revenue per day was primarily attributable to an increase in the contractual dayrates earned by the Ocean Patriot that occurred in the third quarter of 2007, and the Ocean Epoch and Ocean General that occurred during the second and third quarters of 2006, respectively. Average utilization in this region decreased to 94% during 2007 from 97% utilization during 2006, primarily due to 46 days of incremental unpaid downtime in 2007, as compared to 2006, for repairs as well as a survey of the Ocean General and an environmental survey of the Ocean Patriot and related removal of an invasive species of green lipped mussels that had attached itself to the rig while working offshore New Zealand. The decline in utilization during 2007 reduced revenues by $4.4 million. Additionally, during 2007 we recognized $4.6 million in mobilization revenue in connection with the relocations of the Ocean Epoch and the Ocean General to other areas within the Australia/Asia region. During 2006, we recognized $2.3 million in mobilization revenue for the relocation of the Ocean Patriot to New Zealand. Contract drilling expense for the Australia/Asia/Middle East region increased $27.1 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in operating costs was primarily due to higher labor and personnel related costs, including higher local labor costs for the Ocean Epoch, which relocated to Australia in the fourth quarter of 2006 from Malaysia. Other cost increases for our rigs operating in this region during 2007, as compared to 2006, included higher repair and maintenance costs, higher freight costs and additional costs associated with the environmental survey of the Ocean Patriot. These increased costs were partially offset by lower agency fee costs incurred by the Ocean Epoch in 2007 compared to 2006 when the rig was operating offshore Malaysia. Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. Operating revenue for our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean regions increased $193.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Overall utilization during 2007 increased primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean Lexington ($97.1 million) from the GOM to offshore Egypt in the fourth quarter of 2006. Additionally, the Ocean Princess generated additional revenues of $8.4 million during 2007 compared to 2006 when the rig had 48 days of downtime for an intermediate survey and related repairs. These favorable variances resulting from the increased utilization of two of our rigs in this region were partially offset by 18 days of unpaid downtime for an intermediate survey of the Ocean Vanguard that reduced revenues by $1.9 million in 2007. Also during 2006, we recognized $4.4 million in revenues related to the amortization of lump sum fees received from customers for capital improvements to the Ocean Guardian and Ocean Vanguard. Average operating revenue per day for our North Sea semisubmersibles increased from $144,500 in 2006 to $211,500 in 2007, contributing $93.9 million in additional revenue in 2007 as compared to 2006. The overall increase in average operating revenue per day in this market was primarily due to higher dayrates earned by the Ocean Nomad, Ocean Guardian and Ocean Vanguard during 2007. Contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean markets increased $34.1 million in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating costs for the Ocean Lexington ($21.8 million). Increased operating expenses in 2007 are also reflective of higher labor and benefits costs incurred in 2007 for our rigs operating in the North Sea, including the effect of compensation increases and implementation of a retention plan, and higher shorebase support costs. However, overall operating expense increases in this region during 2007 were partially offset by lower mobilization and inspection costs associated with surveys, as costs incurred for the Ocean Vanguards intermediate survey in December 2007 were well below aggregate expenses related to surveys for the Ocean Guardian and Ocean Princess in 2006. 38 Table of Contents South America. Revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the South American region increased $55.4 million to $132.1 million in 2007 from $76.7 million in 2006. During 2007, we relocated the Ocean Whittington (Brazil) and the Ocean Worker (Trinidad and Tobago) to this region where they generated revenues of $25.7 million and $21.5 million, respectively. For our other two semisubmersible rigs operating offshore Brazil in both 2007 and 2006, average operating revenue per day in 2007 increased to $123,900 from $113,700 in 2006, resulting in a $7.0 million increase in revenue from 2006. Operating expenses for our operations in the South American region increased $30.6 million in 2007, as compared to 2006, partially due to the inclusion of normal operating and start up costs for the Ocean Whittington and the Ocean Worker, as well as start up costs for the Ocean Concord which relocated to Brazil from the GOM in the fourth quarter of 2007 to begin a five year contract. The Ocean Concord did not begin operating under contract until 2008. Other cost increases during 2007 compared to 2006 include increased labor and other personnel related costs, shorebase support and freight costs, as well as higher repair and maintenance costs.

Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the GOM decreased $93.0 million during 2007 compared to 2006. The decline in revenues was primarily due to the relocation of three of our jack up rigs from the GOM to other markets: the Ocean King to Croatia in the third quarter of 2007; the Ocean Nugget to Mexico in the fourth quarter of 2006; and the Ocean Spur to Tunisia in the first quarter of 2006. These rigs generated $56.0 million in revenues while operating in the GOM in 2006 compared to only $13.3 million earned by the Ocean King in the GOM during 2007. In addition, the Ocean Columbia, which was in a shipyard for a majority of the fourth quarter of 2007 for preparation work in connection with an 18 month contract offshore Mexico, generated revenues of $28.8 million in the GOM during 2007 compared to $37.5 million in 2006. Average utilization (excluding the Ocean Columbia, Ocean King, Ocean Nugget and Ocean Spur) declined from 90% during 2006 to 78% during 2007 resulting in a reduction in revenues of $29.6 million. The decline in utilization was primarily in response to market conditions in the GOM that caused us to ready stack certain of our jack up rigs for a portion of time between wells, scheduled downtime for surveys of the Ocean Crusader and Ocean Tower and contract preparation activities for the Ocean Columbia. The Ocean Columbia departed the GOM for Mexico at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007. Revenues also declined due to a decrease in average operating dayrates. Average operating revenue per day in 2007, excluding the Ocean Columbia, Ocean King, Ocean Nugget and Ocean Spur, decreased to $90,500 from $96,500 in 2006, resulting in a $11.9 million decrease in revenue from 2006. 39 Table of Contents Contract drilling expense in the GOM increased $7.7 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The overall increase in costs was primarily due to higher survey and related repair costs in 2007, contract preparation activities for the Ocean Columbia, as well as increased repair and ready stacking costs for several of our rigs marketed in the GOM. In addition, operating costs for our rigs in this market were negatively impacted by regular salary increases and higher overhead costs. The overall increase in operating costs was partially offset by the absence of operating costs in the GOM for the Ocean Nugget and Ocean Spur and lower operating costs for the Ocean King during 2007, which reduced operating expenses by $19.5 million. Mexico. The Ocean Nugget, which began operating offshore Mexico in the fourth quarter of 2006, generated $62.5 million in revenues during 2007 and incurred contract drilling expenses of $16.1 million. We had no jack up rigs operating in this market prior to the fourth quarter of 2006. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Our two jack up rigs operating in the Australia/Asia/Middle East regions generated revenues of $88.5 million during 2007 compared to $61.1 million in 2006. The $27.4 million increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in average operating revenue per day earned by our rigs in this region from $95,600 during 2006 to $123,600 for 2007, primarily due to new contracts at higher dayrates for both the Ocean Heritage and Ocean Sovereign that began late in the second and third quarters of 2006, respectively, as well as additional dayrate increases for both rigs during 2007 which generated additional revenues of $19.5 million. Average utilization for our rigs in this region increased from 87% during 2006 to 98% in 2007 primarily due to increased utilization for both the Ocean Heritage and Ocean Sovereign in 2007, as compared to 2006 when these rigs were out of service for scheduled surveys and related repairs. The increase in utilization in 2007 resulted in the generation of additional revenues of $8.3 million. Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean regions increased $30.1 million during 2007 compared to 2006. Our jack up rig, the Ocean Spur, began operating offshore Tunisia in March 2006 and generated revenues of $42.8 million and $32.9 million during 2006 and 2007, respectively. The rig subsequently mobilized to the Mediterranean Basin and began operating offshore Egypt in late May 2007, generating revenues of $36.6 million. During the third quarter of 2007, we relocated the Ocean King from the GOM to Croatia where it began operating under a two year bareboat charter, generating revenues of $3.3 million in 2007. Operating expenses in this region increased $4.9 million during 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of operating costs for the Ocean Spur in 2007 compared to only nine and one half months of expenses during 2006. Reimbursable expenses, net. Revenues related to reimbursable items, offset by the related expenditures for these items, were $1.8 million and $1.3 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Reimbursable expenses include items that we purchase, and or services we perform, at the request of our customers. We charge our customers for purchases and or services performed on their behalf at cost, plus a mark up where applicable. Therefore, net reimbursables fluctuate based on customer requirements, which vary. General and Administrative Expense. We incurred general and administrative expense of $53.5 million in 2007 compared to $41.6 million in 2006. The $11.9 million increase in overhead costs between the periods was primarily due to an increase in payroll costs resulting from higher compensation and staffing increases, legal fees, engineering and tax consulting fees and miscellaneous office expenses. Gain (Loss) on Disposition of Assets. We recognized a net gain of $8.6 million on the sale and disposition of assets, net of disposal costs, in 2007 compared to a net loss of $1.1 million in 2006. The gain recognized in 2007 primarily consists of the recognition of gains on insurance settlements and from sales of used equipment. The loss recognized in 2006 is primarily the result of costs associated with the removal of production equipment from the Ocean Monarch, which was subsequently sold to a third party. 40 Table of Contents Interest Expense. We recorded interest expense during 2007 of $19.2 million, representing a $4.9 million decrease in interest cost compared to 2006. This decrease was primarily attributable to a greater amount of interest capitalized during 2007 related to our qualifying rig upgrades and construction projects and lower interest cost associated with our 1.5% Debentures. This decrease was partially offset by $9.2 million in debt issuance costs that we wrote off during 2007 in connection with conversions of our 1.5% Debentures and our Zero Coupon Debentures into shares of our common stock. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements 1.5% Debentures and Liquidity and Capital Requirements Zero Coupon Debentures. Foreign Currency Transaction Gain. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) include gains and losses from the settlement of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and fluctuate based on the level of transactions in foreign currencies, as well as fluctuations in such currencies. During 2007 and 2006, we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of $8.1 million and $7.3 million, respectively, on settlement of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Income Tax Expense. Our net income tax expense is a function of the mix of our domestic and international pre tax earnings, as well as the mix of earnings from the international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognized $400.0 million of tax expense on pre tax income of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to tax expense of $259.5 million on a pre tax income of $966.3 million in 2006. Certain of our international rigs were owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited, a Cayman Islands subsidiary which we wholly own. Since forming this subsidiary in 2002, it has been our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of this subsidiary to finance foreign activities. Consequently, no U.S. federal income taxes were provided on these earnings in years subsequent to 2002 except to the extent that such earnings were immediately subject to U.S. federal income tax. In December 2007, this subsidiary made a non recurring distribution of $850.0 million to its U.S. parent, a portion of which consisted of earnings of the subsidiary that had not previously been subjected to U.S. federal income tax. We recognized $58.6 million of U.S. federal income tax expense as a result of the distribution. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007 we recognized $4.4 million of tax expense for uncertain tax positions related to the current year, $0.8 million of which was penalty related tax expense. During 2006 we were able to utilize all of the foreign tax credits available to us and we had no foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2006. At the end of 2005, we had a valuation allowance of $0.8 million for certain of our foreign tax credit carryforwards which was reversed during 2006 as the valuation allowance was no longer necessary. During 2006 we recorded an $8.3 million tax benefit related to the deduction allowable under Internal Revenue Code Section 199 for domestic production activities. During the second quarter of 2006, the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service issued guidelines regarding the deduction allowable under Internal Revenue Code Section 199 which was previously believed to be unavailable to the drilling industry with respect to qualified production activities income. The $8.3 million tax benefit recognized included $2.2 million related to the year 2005. 41 Table of Contents Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from our operations and our cash reserves. We may also make use of our $285 million credit facility for cash liquidity. See $285 Million Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2008, we had $336.1 million in Cash and cash equivalents and $400.6 million in Investments and marketable securities, representing our investment of cash available for current operations. Cash Flows from Operations. Our cash flows from operations are impacted by the ability of our customers to weather the current global financial and credit crisis. In general, before working for a customer with whom we have not had a prior business relationship and or whose financial stability may be uncertain to us, we perform a credit review on that company. Based on that analysis, we may require that the customer present a letter of credit, prepay or provide other credit enhancements. Tightening of the credit markets may preclude us from doing business with potential customers and could have an impact on our existing customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. These external factors which affect our cash flows from operations are not within our control and are difficult to predict. For a description of other factors that could affect our cash flows from operations, see Overview Industry Conditions, Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. $285 Million Revolving Credit Facility. We maintain a $285 million syndicated, senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility, for general corporate purposes, including loans and performance or standby letters of credit, that will mature on November 2, 2011. Loans under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, either (i) the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin, varying from 0.20% to 0.525%, based on our current credit ratings. Under our Credit Facility, we also pay, based on our current credit ratings, and as applicable, other customary fees, including, but not limited to, a facility fee on the total commitment under the Credit Facility regardless of usage and a utilization fee that applies if the aggregate of all loans outstanding under the Credit Facility equals or exceeds 50% of the total commitment under the facility. Changes in credit ratings could lower or raise the fees that we pay under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, the maintenance of a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization, as defined in the Credit Facility, of not more than 60% at the end of each fiscal quarter and limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations, liquidation and dissolution, changes in lines of business, swap agreements, transactions with affiliates and subsidiary indebtedness. Based on our current credit ratings at December 31, 2008, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans would have been 0.24%. As of December 31, 2008, there were no loans outstanding under the Credit Facility; however $58.1 million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the Credit Facility. Liquidity and Capital Requirements Our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements. We determine the amount of cash required to meet our capital commitments by evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, including water depth and drilling capability upgrades. We believe that our operating cash flows and cash reserves will be sufficient to meet both our working capital requirements and our capital commitments over the next twelve months; however, we will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions and will adjust capital spending programs if required. In addition, we may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. Our ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity securities will be dependent on our results of operations, our current financial condition, current market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Additionally, we may also make use of our Credit Facility to finance capital expenditures or for other general corporate purposes. 42 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Obligations.

See further information regarding these contracts in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Exchange Risk and Note 5 Derivative Financial Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. As of December 31, 2008, the total unrecognized tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions was $23.7 million. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with the liabilities recognized in this balance, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2008, we had purchase obligations aggregating approximately $23 million related to the major upgrade of the Ocean Monarch. We expect to complete funding of this project in 2009. We had no other purchase obligations for major rig upgrades or any other significant obligations at December 31, 2008, except for those related to our direct rig operations, which arise during the normal course of business. Other Commercial Commitments Letters of Credit. We were contingently liable as of December 31, 2008 in the amount of $149.1 million under certain performance, bid, supersedeas and custom bonds and letters of credit, including $58.1 million in letters of credit issued under our Credit Facility. Six of these bonds totaling $88.5 million were purchased from a related party after obtaining competitive quotes. Agreements relating to approximately $80.3 million of performance bonds can require collateral at any time. As of December 31, 2008 we had not been required to make any collateral deposits with respect to these agreements. The remaining agreements cannot require collateral except 43 Table of Contents in events of default. On our behalf, banks have issued letters of credit securing certain of these bonds.

On April 11, 2001, we issued $460.0 million principal amount of 1.5% Debentures, which were due April 15, 2031. The 1.5% Debentures were convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 20.3978 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 1.5% Debentures, or $49.02 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. During the period from January 1, 2008 to April 14, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2007, the holders of $3.5 million and $456.4 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of our 1.5% Debentures elected to convert their outstanding debentures into shares of our common stock. We issued 71,144 shares and 9,309,616 shares of our common stock in 2008 and 2007, respectively, pursuant to these conversions. In addition, we had the option to redeem all or a portion of the 1.5% Debentures at any time on or after April 15, 2008 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. On April 15, 2008, we completed the redemption of all of our outstanding 1.5% Debentures, and, as a result, redeemed for cash the remaining $73,000 aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 1.5% Debentures See 1.5% Debentures in Note 10 Long Term Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Zero Coupon Debentures. We issued our Zero Coupon Debentures on June 6, 2000 at a price of $499.60 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which represents a yield to maturity of 3.50% per year. The Zero Coupon Debentures mature on June 6, 2020, and, as of December 31, 2008, the aggregate accreted value of our outstanding Zero Coupon Debentures was $4.0 million. We will not pay interest prior to maturity unless we elect to convert the Zero Coupon Debentures to 44 Table of Contents interest bearing debentures upon the occurrence of certain tax events. The Zero Coupon Debentures are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into our common stock at a fixed conversion rate of 8.6075 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of Zero Coupon Debentures, subject to adjustments in certain events. See Zero Coupon Debentures in Note 10 Long Term Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The Zero Coupon Debentures are senior unsecured obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. During 2008 and 2007, holders of $33,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, in accreted, or carrying, value through the date of conversion of our Zero Coupon Debentures elected to convert their outstanding debentures into shares of our common stock. We issued 430 and 20,658 shares of our common stock upon conversion of these debentures during 2008 and 2007, respectively. The aggregate principal amount at maturity of our Zero Coupon Debentures converted during 2008 and 2007 was $50,000 and $2.4 million, respectively. Credit Ratings. Our current credit rating is Baa1 for Moodys Investors Services and A for Standard Poors. Although our long term ratings continue at investment grade levels, lower ratings would result in higher rates for borrowings under our Credit Facility and could also result in higher interest rates on future debt issuances. Capital Expenditures. During 2008, construction of our two high performance, premium jack up rigs, the Ocean Shield and Ocean Scepter, was completed at an aggregate construction cost of approximately $324 million. Both rigs began operating under contract during 2008. The upgrade of the Ocean Monarch was completed late in the fourth quarter of 2008 for an aggregate expected cost of approximately $310 million. The Ocean Monarch arrived in the GOM in late January 2009, and we are making final preparations for a four year term contract, which we expect to commence late in the first quarter of 2009. During 2008, we spent $181.9 million on construction and upgrade projects. During 2008, we spent approximately $485.0 million on our continuing rig capital maintenance program (other than rig upgrades and new construction) and to meet other corporate capital expenditure requirements, including $125.1 million towards modification of certain of our rigs to meet contractual requirements. We have budgeted approximately $400 million on capital expenditures for 2009 associated with our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, equipment required for our long term international contracts and other corporate requirements. In addition, we expect to spend an additional $70.0 million in 2009 in connection with a repowering project and water depth upgrade for the Ocean Bounty. We expect to finance our 2009 capital expenditures through the use of our existing cash balances or internally generated funds. From time to time, however, we may also make use of our Credit Facility to finance capital expenditures. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had no off balance sheet debt or other arrangements. 45 Table of Contents Historical Cash Flows The following is a discussion of our historical cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change (In thousands) Net income $ 1,311,020 $ 846,541 $ 464,479 Net changes in operating assets and liabilities (87,321 ) 129,383 (216,704 ) (Gain) loss on sale and disposition of assets, including casualty loss on Ocean Tower 3,450 (8,583 ) 12,033 (Gain) loss on sale of marketable securities (1,282 ) (1,796 ) 514 (Gain) loss on foreign currency forward exchange contracts 54,010 (5,423 ) 59,433 Deferred tax provision 61,498 1,770 59,728 Depreciation and other non cash items, net 278,313 246,424 31,889 $ 1,619,688 $ 1,208,316 $ 411,372 Our cash flows from operations in 2008 increased $411.4 million or 34% compared to 2007. The increase in cash flows from operations in 2008 is primarily the result of higher average dayrates earned by our rigs as a result of high worldwide demand for offshore contract drilling services through 2008 compared to 2007. The favorable contribution to cash flows was partially offset by lower utilization of our offshore drilling units due to planned downtime for modifications to our rigs to meet customer requirements and regulatory surveys, as well as the ready stacking of rigs within our GOM jack up fleet between wells. However, the increase in cash flows from operations during 2008 was partially offset by an increase in cash required to satisfy our working capital requirements. Trade and other receivables used cash of $42.5 million during 2008 primarily due to a $31.9 million provision for bad debts recorded as a result of one of our customers in the U.K. entering into administration (a U.K. insolvency proceeding similar to U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy) and our expectation that the receivable would not be collectible. During 2008, we received insurance proceeds of $9.4 million related to the settlement of certain hurricane related insurance claims resulting from damages sustained in 2005. During 2007, we received insurance proceeds of $51.2 million related to the settlement of certain claims also arising from the 2005 hurricanes (total insurance proceeds of $56.1 million were received of which $4.9 million is included as a reduction in net cash used in investing activities). During 2008, we made U.S. federal income tax payments of $393.2 million compared to $299.6 million in 2007 for estimated U.S. federal and state income tax payments. We paid foreign income taxes, net of refunds, of $120.7 million and $31.7 million during 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change (In thousands) Purchase of marketable securities $ (1,888,792 ) $ (2,850,135 ) $ 961,343 Proceeds from sale of marketable securities 1,493,803 3,163,475 (1,669,672 ) Capital expenditures (666,857 ) (647,101 ) (19,756 ) Proceeds from disposition of assets 5,881 10,861 (4,980 ) Proceeds from settlement of forward contracts (16,800 ) 8,109 (24,909 ) $ (1,072,765 ) $ (314,791 ) $ (757,974 ) Our investing activities used $1.1 billion in 2008 compared to $314.8 million in 2007. During 2008, we purchased marketable securities, net of sales, of $395.0 million compared to net sales of $313.3 million during 2007. Our level of investment activity is dependent on our working capital and other capital requirements during the year, as well as a response to actual or anticipated events or conditions in the securities markets. During 2008, we spent approximately $181.9 million related to the major upgrade of the Ocean Monarch and construction of the Ocean Scepter and Ocean Shield. During 2007, we spent approximately $258.7 million related 46 Table of Contents to major upgrades and construction projects, including $38.8 million towards the major upgrade of the Ocean Endeavor. Expenditures for our ongoing capital maintenance programs, including rig modifications to meet contractual requirements, were $485.0 million in 2008 compared to $388.4 million in 2007. The increase in expenditures related to our ongoing capital maintenance program in 2008 compared to 2007 is related to an increase in discretionary funds available for capital spending in 2008, as well as a response to customer requirements. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures. Primarily during the latter part of 2008, the strengthening U.S. dollar (or, conversely, the weakening foreign currency) negatively impacted our expiring foreign currency forward exchange contracts entered into as economic hedges of our foreign currency requirements and resulted in an aggregate realized loss of $16.8 million for 2008. During 2007, we recognized $8.1 million in realized gains on the settlement of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. As of December 31, 2008, we had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding, in the aggregate notional amount of $214.6 million, consisting of $50.1 million in Australian dollars, $69.4 million in Brazilian reais, $62.1 million in British pounds sterling, $16.9 million in Mexican pesos and $16.1 million in Norwegian kroner. These contracts settle at various times through June 2009. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change (In thousands) Payment of dividends $ (852,153 ) $ (796,292 ) $ (55,861 ) Proceeds from stock options exercised 2,002 10,836 (8,834 ) Other 1,319 5,194 (3,875 ) $ (848,832 ) $ (780,262 ) $ (68,570 ) During 2008, we paid cash dividends totaling $852.2 million, consisting of aggregate regular cash dividends of $69.5 million, or $0.125 per share of our common stock per quarter, and aggregate special cash dividends of $782.7 million ($1.25 per share of our common stock for each of the first three quarters of 2008 and $1.875 per share of our common stock during the final quarter of 2008). During 2007, we paid cash dividends totaling $796.3 million, consisting of regular cash dividends aggregating $69.3 million, or $0.125 per share of our common stock per quarter, and special cash dividends of $4.00 and $1.25 per share of our common stock, for the first and fourth quarters, respectively, totaling $553.4 million and $173.6 million, respectively. On February 4, 2009, we declared a regular quarterly cash dividend and a special cash dividend of $0.125 and $1.875, respectively, per share of our common stock. Both the quarterly and special cash dividends are payable on March 2, 2009 to stockholders of record on February 13, 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2007, our Board of Directors adopted a policy of considering paying special cash dividends, in amounts to be determined, on a quarterly basis, rather than annually. Our Board of Directors may, in subsequent quarters, consider paying additional special cash dividends, in amounts to be determined, if it believes that our financial position, earnings, earnings outlook, capital spending plans and other relevant factors warrant such action at that time. Depending on market conditions, we may, from time to time, purchase shares of our common stock in the open market or otherwise. We did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Other Currency Risk. Some of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their operations in the local currency of the country where they conduct operations. Currency environments in which we have significant business operations include Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Australia and Malaysia. When possible, we attempt to minimize our currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to our estimated operating costs payable in local currency with the balance of the contract payable in U.S. dollars. At present, however, only a limited number of our contracts are payable both in U.S. dollars and the local currency. To the extent that we are not able to cover our local currency operating costs with customer payments in the 47 Table of Contents local currency, we also utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce our currency exchange risk. Our forward currency exchange contracts may obligate us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specific dates or to net settle the spread between the contracted foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date, which for certain contracts is the average spot rate for the contract period. We record currency transaction gains and losses, including gains and losses on settlement of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts, as Foreign currency transaction gain (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Staff Position, or FSP, Accounting Principles Board, or APB, 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), or FSP APB 14 1. FSP APB 14 1 applies to convertible debt instruments that, by their stated terms, may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement). The FSP requires bifurcation of the instrument into a debt component that is initially valued at fair value and an equity component. The debt component is accreted to par value using the effective yield method, and accretion is reported as a component of interest expense. The equity component is not subsequently revalued as long as it continues to qualify for equity treatment. FSP APB 14 1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years on a retrospective basis for all periods presented. We will adopt FSP APB 14 1 effective January 1, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of this staff position to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position in the current year or prospectively. Forward Looking Statements We or our representatives may, from time to time, make or incorporate by reference certain written or oral statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.

Other sections of this report and our other filings with the SEC include additional factors that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial performance. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. Forward looking statements included in this report speak only as of the date of this report. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations with regard to the statement or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward looking statement is based. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The information included in this Item 7A is considered to constitute forward looking statements for purposes of the statutory safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements in Item 7 of this report. Our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments. Market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. We believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur. Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by our senior management. Senior management approves the overall investment strategy that we employ and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to us. We may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. Our investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities. We monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates. The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity. The analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period. The sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly, the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our earnings or stockholders equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Loans under our $285 million syndicated, senior unsecured revolving Credit Facility bear interest at our option at a rate per annum equal to (i) the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin, varying from 0.20% to 0.525%, based on our current credit ratings. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were no loans outstanding under the Credit Facility (however, as of December 31, 2008, $58.1 million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the Credit Facility). 50 Table of Contents Our long term debt, as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates, and as such, interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of $20.9 million and $35.8 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. A 100 basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of $21.6 million and $11.6 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. It is customary for us to enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the normal course of business. These contracts may require us to exchange predetermined amounts of foreign currencies on specified dates or to net settle the spread between the contracted foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date, which for certain of our outstanding contracts is the average spot rate for the contract period. As of December 31, 2008, we had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding, in the aggregate notional amount of $214.6 million, consisting of $50.1 million in Australian dollars, $69.4 million in Brazilian reais, $62.1 million in British pounds sterling, $16.9 million in Mexican pesos and $16.1 million in Norwegian kroner. These contracts settle at various times through June 2009. At December 31, 2008, we have presented the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts as a current liability of $(37.3) million in Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities. We have presented the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts at December 31, 2007 as a current asset of $2,000 in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and a current liability of $(93,000) in Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their levels at December 31, 2008 and 2007. The following table presents our exposure to market risk by category (interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates): Fair Value Asset (Liability) Market Risk December 31, December 31, 2008 2007 2008 2007 (In thousands) Interest rate: Marketable securities $ 400,592 (a) $ 1,301 (a) $ (2,000 ) (c) $ (100 ) (c) Long term debt 470,040 (b) (500,303 ) (b) Foreign Exchange: Forward exchange contracts receivable positions (d) 2 (d) (e) (100 ) (e) Forward exchange contracts liability positions (37,300 ) (d) (93 ) (d) (32,600 ) (e) (3,400 ) (e) (a) The fair market value of our investment in marketable securities, excluding repurchase agreements, is based on the quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2008 and 2007. (b) The fair values of our 4.875% Senior Notes and 5.15% Senior Notes are based on the quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. The fair value of our Zero Coupon Debentures is based on the closing market price of our common stock on December 31, 2008 and quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2007. There were no 1.5% Debentures outstanding at December 31, 2008. (c) The calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points at December 31, 2008 and 2007. (d) The fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is based on both quoted market prices and valuations derived from pricing models on December 31, 2008 and 2007. 51 Table of Contents (e) The calculation of estimated foreign exchange risk assumes an instantaneous 20% decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their values at December 31, 2008 and 2007, with all other variables held constant. 52 Table of Contents
