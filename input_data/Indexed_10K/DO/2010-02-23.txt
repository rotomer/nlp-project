Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements (including the Notes thereto) in Item 8 of this report. We provide contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe and are a leader in offshore drilling. Our fleet of 47 offshore drilling rigs consists of 32 semisubmersibles, 14 jack ups and one drillship. Overview Industry Conditions The global economy remained weak in the fourth quarter of 2009 and into the first quarter of 2010 and energy prices continued to be volatile. Given the unpredictable economic environment, the demand for our services and the dayrates we were able to command for new contracts softened. This volatility and uncertainty could continue until the global economy improves. Absent global economic improvement the decline in drilling activity could be further exacerbated by the influx of new build rigs over the next several years, particularly in regard to jack up units. We have experienced negative effects of the current market such as customer credit problems, customers attempting to renegotiate or terminate contracts, one customer seeking bankruptcy protection, a further slowing in the pace of new contracting activity, declines in dayrates for new contracts, declines in utilization and the stacking of idle equipment. Nevertheless, during 2009, we added new commitments to our contract backlog. We entered 2010 with a contract backlog approaching $8.5 billion, which we expect to help mitigate the impact of the current market on us in 2010. Floaters Approximately 81% of the time on our intermediate and high specification floater rigs is committed for 2010. Additionally, 55% of the time on our floating rigs is committed in 2011. International Jack ups The industrys jack up market is divided between an international sector and a U.S. sector, with the international sector historically characterized by contracts of longer duration and higher prices, compared to the generally shorter term and lower priced domestic sector. However, in 2009 demand and dayrates softened internationally as existing rigs rolled off contract and met competition from un contracted new build jack ups that came to market. It is expected that this oversupply of jack up rigs will have an increasingly negative impact on the international sector during 2010 and beyond. GOM Jack ups In the domestic jack up sector, lower natural gas prices have negatively impacted both demand and dayrates. In response, to reduce costs, we have cold stacked three of our lower end jack up units, and they are not being actively marketed. Our four remaining higher specification jack ups in the GOM are largely working under short term contracts. Absent a sustained improvement in energy prices, weakness in the GOM jack up market is likely to continue in 2010, with the possibility of additional rigs being cold stacked by the industry in an effort to help bring equipment supply and demand into equilibrium. Contract Drilling Backlog The following table reflects our contract drilling backlog as of February 1, 2010, October 22, 2009 (the date reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009) and February 5, 2009 (the date reported in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008). The October 2009 period includes both firm commitments (typically represented by signed contracts), as well as previously disclosed letters of intent, or LOIs, where indicated. An LOI is subject to customary conditions, including the execution of a definitive agreement, and as such may not result in a binding contract. Contract drilling backlog is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period and adding one half of any potential rig performance bonuses. Our calculation also assumes full utilization of our drilling equipment for the contract period (excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days); however, the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual 21 Table of Contents periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors. Utilization rates, which generally approach 95 98% during contracted periods, can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including, but not limited to, weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance. Contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and customer reimbursables. No revenue is generally earned during periods of downtime for regulatory surveys. Changes in our contract drilling backlog between periods are a function of the performance of work on term contracts, as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts.

The Ocean Tower lost its derrick, drill floor and drill floor equipment during the hurricane. During the third quarter of 2008, we wrote off the approximately $2.6 million net book value of the derrick, drill floor and drill floor equipment for the Ocean Tower and accrued $3.7 million in estimated salvage costs for the recovery of equipment from the ocean floor. The aggregate amount of these items was reflected in Casualty Loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in Item 8 of this report. In December 2008, we entered into an agreement to sell the Ocean Tower and transferred the $32.2 million net book value of the rig to Assets held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report. The sale of the Ocean Tower was completed on October 26, 2009, and we recognized a $6.7 million gain on the sale which has been presented as Gain on disposition of assets in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 included in Item 8 of this report. The agreement prohibited the competitive use of the rig, which is expected to be deployed by the purchaser as an accommodation unit. General The two most significant variables affecting our revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates, each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace. Demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development, as well as a variety of political and economic factors. The availability of rigs in a particular geographical region also affects both dayrates and utilization rates. These factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict. Demand affects the number of days our fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned. As utilization rates increase, dayrates tend to increase as well, reflecting the lower supply of available rigs. Conversely, as utilization rates decrease, dayrates tend to decrease as well, reflecting the excess supply of rigs. When a rig is idle, no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result. Revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs, required surveys and shipyard upgrades. In order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates, we may mobilize our rigs from one market to another. However, during periods of mobilization, revenues may be adversely affected. As a response to changes in demand, we may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously, which may decrease or increase revenues, respectively. We recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed. In connection with such drilling contracts, we may receive fees (either lump sum or dayrate) for the mobilization of equipment. We earn these fees as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. We defer mobilization fees received, as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred, and amortize each, on a straight line basis, over the term of the related drilling contracts (which is the period we estimate to be benefited from the mobilization activity). Straight line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts (which generally range from two to 60 months) is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed. Absent a contract, mobilization costs are recognized currently. From time to time, we may receive fees from our customers for capital improvements to our rigs (either lump sum or dayrate). We defer such fees and recognize them into income on a straight line basis over the period of the related drilling contract as a component of contract drilling revenue. We capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of the improvement. We receive reimbursements for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services and other services provided at the request of our customers in accordance with a contract or agreement. We record these reimbursements at the gross amount billed to the customer, as Revenues related to reimbursable expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in Item 8 of this report. Operating Income. Our operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors, but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses. Our operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling equipment. The principal components of our operating costs are, among other things, direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory inspections, boat and helicopter rentals and insurance. Labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most 23 Table of Contents significant components of our operating expenses. In general, our labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels, rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which our rigs operate. Costs to repair and maintain our equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing, as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the regions in which our rigs are working. Operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates, and short term reductions in utilization do not necessarily result in lower operating expenses. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or ready stacked state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract. However, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, we may reduce the size of a rigs crew and take steps to cold stack the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income. We recognize, as incurred, operating expenses related to activities such as inspections, painting projects and routine overhauls that meet certain criteria and which maintain rather than upgrade our rigs. These expenses vary from period to period. Costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements. Higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods following capital upgrades. For 2010, we expect depreciation expense to increase approximately $26.6 million compared to 2009, due to the 2009 acquisitions of the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor. See Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures. Periods of high, sustained utilization may result in cost increases for maintenance and repairs in order to maintain our equipment in proper, working order. In addition, during periods of high activity and dayrates, higher prices generally pervade the entire offshore drilling industry and its support businesses, which causes our costs for goods and services to increase. Our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections, which we refer to as a 5 year survey, or special survey, that are due every five years for each of our rigs. Operating revenue decreases because these surveys are performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard. Operating expenses increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs. Repair and maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of rigs undergoing a 5 year survey will vary from year to year, as well as from quarter to quarter. In addition, operating income may be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim periods between 5 year surveys. Intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a 5 year survey. Although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the drilling rig, it normally does not require dry docking or shipyard time, except for rigs located in the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. During 2010, five of our rigs will require 5 year surveys, and we expect that they will be out of service for approximately 320 days in the aggregate. We also expect to spend an additional approximately 730 days during 2010 for intermediate surveys, the mobilization of rigs, commissioning and contract acceptance testing and extended maintenance projects. We can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and or duration of downtime associated with regulatory inspections, planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects. See Overview Contract Drilling Backlog. We are self insured for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. If a named windstorm in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico causes significant damage to our rigs or equipment, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, under our current insurance policy that expires on May 1, 2010, we continue to carry physical damage insurance for certain losses other than those caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, for which our deductible for physical damage is $25.0 million per occurrence. Construction and Capital Upgrade Projects. We capitalize interest cost for the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP. The period of interest capitalization covers the duration of the activities required to make the asset ready for its intended use, and 24 Table of Contents the capitalization period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we capitalized interest of $16.9 million and $19.3 million, respectively, on qualifying expenditures related to the upgrades of the Ocean Endeavor and Ocean Monarch for ultra deepwater service and the construction of two jack up rigs, the Ocean Shield and Ocean Scepter, through the date of each projects completion. The upgrades of the Ocean Endeavor and Ocean Monarch were completed in March 2007 and December 2008, respectively. Construction of the Ocean Shield and Ocean Scepter was completed in May 2008 and August 2008, respectively. We did not capitalize interest on any qualifying assets during 2009. Interest Expense. We expect interest expense in 2010 to increase approximately $32.5 million compared to 2009 as a result of our issuance of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.70% Senior Notes due 2039, or 5.70% Senior Notes, in October 2009 and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2019, or 5.875% Senior Notes, in May 2009. See Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and Capital Requirements 5.70% Senior Notes and Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and Capital Requirements 5.875% Senior Notes. Also see Note 10 Long Term Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Critical Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 General Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Judgments, assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies. We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows: Property, Plant and Equipment. We carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost. Maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments, which meet certain criteria, are capitalized. Depreciation is amortized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives. Our management makes judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization, useful lives and salvage values. Changes in these judgments, assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported. We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable (such as the cold stacking a rig or excess spending over budget on a new build or major rig upgrade). We utilize a probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. Our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following: dayrate by rig; utilization rate by rig (expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used); the per day operating cost for each rig if active, ready stacked or cold stacked; and salvage value for each rig. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we develop a matrix by assigning probabilities to various combinations of assumed utilization rates and dayrates. We also consider the impact of a 5% reduction in assumed dayrates for the cold stacked rigs (holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant), or alternatively the impact of a 5% reduction in utilization (again holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant) as part of our analysis. As of December 31, 2009, we had cold stacked our three mat supported jack up rigs and were in the process of cold stacking an intermediate semisubmersible drilling rig in Malaysia. We performed an impairment review for each of these rigs using the methodology described above. Based on our analyses, we have concluded that these four rigs were not subject to impairment at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, the remaining rigs in our fleet were currently working under contract, mobilizing to new locations or being actively marketed. We do not believe that current circumstances indicate that there was an impairment of these 43 rigs at December 31, 2009. Managements assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. 25 Table of Contents Personal Injury Claims. Our deductible for liability coverage for personal injury claims, which primarily result from Jones Act liability in the Gulf of Mexico, is $5.0 million per occurrence, with no aggregate deductible. The Jones Act is a federal law that permits seamen to seek compensation for certain injuries during the course of their employment on a vessel and governs the liability of vessel operators and marine employers for the work related injury or death of an employee. We estimate our aggregate reserve for personal injury claims based on our historical losses and utilizing various actuarial models. The eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from our estimated amounts due to uncertainties such as: the severity of personal injuries claimed; significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims; the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated; inconsistent court decisions; and the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards that require the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if necessary, which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach. We do not establish deferred tax liabilities for certain of our foreign earnings that we intend to indefinitely reinvest to finance foreign activities. However, if these earnings become subject to U.S. federal tax, any required provision could have a material impact on our financial results. We make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to the forecasting of our effective tax rate, the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits, and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit. We record interest related to accrued unrecognized tax positions in interest expense and recognize penalties associated with uncertain tax positions in our tax expense. 26 Table of Contents Results of Operations Although we perform contract drilling services with different types of drilling rigs and in many geographic locations, there is a similarity of economic characteristics among all our divisions and locations, including the nature of services provided and the type of customers for our services. We believe that the combination of our drilling rigs into one reportable segment is the appropriate aggregation in accordance with applicable accounting standards on segment reporting. However, for purposes of this discussion and analysis of our results of operations, we provide greater detail with respect to the types of rigs in our fleet and the geographic regions in which they operate to enhance the readers understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 Comparative data relating to our revenue and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below.

During 2009, our contracted revenue backlog allowed us to partially mitigate the impact of the global economic recession on our business. Despite the downturn in the market, our contract drilling revenues increased $60.2 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The Ocean Monarch, which began service in mid March 2009 after completing a major upgrade, generated revenues of $124.5 million during 2009. Our two new build jack up rigs, the Ocean Shield and Ocean Scepter, contributed additional revenues of $90.1 million during 2009 compared to 2008. However, our operating results were negatively impacted by ready stacking of the Ocean Star, Ocean Victory, Ocean Guardian and Ocean Scepter for extended periods and the cold stacking of our three mat supported GOM jack up rigs. The Ocean Bounty completed its contract offshore Australia in the third quarter of 2009 and is currently being prepared for cold stacking in Malaysia. In addition, the international jack up market, which had remained strong throughout the majority of 2008, continued to be affected by softening demand and reduced dayrates during 2009. Total contract drilling expenses in 2009 increased $38.8 million, or 3% compared to 2008. Operating costs during 2009 include normal operating costs for the upgraded Ocean Monarch and a full year of operating costs for our two new build jack ups. Depreciation expense increased $59.0 million to $346.4 million during 2009, or 21% compared to 2008, due to a higher depreciable asset base for 2009. Depreciation expense for 2009 included depreciation associated with our capital additions in 2008 and 2009, including the Ocean Shield, Ocean Scepter and Ocean Monarch, which were all placed in service at various times during 2008. Depreciation expense for 2009 also included depreciation of the newly acquired Ocean Courage. See Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures. High Specification Floaters.

Revenues generated by our high specification floaters operating in the GOM decreased $108.2 million during 2009 compared to 2008. Excluding the Ocean Monarch, our GOM fleet had approximately 700 fewer rig operating days in 2009, compared to the prior year, resulting in a $283.7 million reduction in revenues generated by the fleet in 2009. The decrease in utilization is attributable to incremental downtime associated with contract preparation activities and subsequent relocation out of the GOM of two of our high specification floaters, the Ocean Quest (to Brazil late in the first quarter of 2009) and the Ocean Valiant (to Angola during the third quarter of 2009) and scheduled surveys and related repairs. In addition, two of our rigs were ready stacked for a total of 245 days in 2009 compared to zero ready stack days in 2008. Average operating revenue per day for our high specification floaters in this market (excluding the Ocean Monarch) increased to $417,100 in 2009 compared to $394,100 in 2008, resulting in the generation of additional revenues of $51.1 million. 28 Table of Contents Operating costs for our high specification floaters in the GOM increased by $26.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008 to $250.0 million. The overall increase in operating costs in 2009 was primarily due to higher survey, repair and mobilization costs associated with a special survey for the Ocean America. These cost increases were partially offset by lower operating costs in the region for the Ocean Quest and Ocean Valiant, which we relocated to Brazil and Angola, respectively. The Ocean Monarch, which began operating in the GOM late in the first quarter of 2009, generated revenues and incurred operating expenses, including the amortization of deferred mobilization costs, of $124.5 million and $28.1 million, respectively. Australia/Asia/Middle East. During 2009, our high specification rig operating offshore Malaysia, the Ocean Rover, generated $84.3 million in additional revenues compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in average operating revenue per day from $237,200 during 2008 to $433,700 during 2009 ($69.7 million). Utilization increased in 2009 compared to 2008, when the rig had 67 days of scheduled downtime for a special survey and related repairs, resulting in the generation of $14.6 million in incremental revenues. Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. The Ocean Valiant began operating offshore Angola in the third quarter of 2009 and generated revenues and incurred operating expenses of $66.2 million and $14.0 million, respectively. South America. Revenues earned by our high specification floaters operating offshore Brazil in 2009 increased $16.3 million compared to 2008. The Ocean Quest, which we relocated from the GOM late in the first quarter of 2009, generated additional revenues in 2009 of $90.3 million compared to 2008. Increased utilization in 2009 of the Ocean Clipper, which experienced significant downtime during 2008 for a survey and unplanned repairs to its propulsion system, generated incremental revenues of $17.3 million compared to 2008. However, total revenues generated in the region were negatively impacted by a decline in average operating revenue per day for the Ocean Alliance from $443,600 in 2008 to $187,200 in 2009, resulting in an $84.8 million reduction in revenues. Contract drilling expense for our operations in Brazil increased slightly in 2009 by $0.5 million compared to 2008, primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating costs for the Ocean Quest partially offset by a reduction in costs attributable to a 2008 survey of the Ocean Clipper and repairs to its propulsion system. Intermediate Semisubmersibles.

Revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersible fleet operating in the GOM in 2009 decreased $2.7 million compared to 2008. The decrease in revenues is primarily due to a decrease in operating dayrate earned by the Ocean Saratoga in 2009 compared to 2008 ($20.8 million). The Ocean Ambassador, which relocated to the GOM from Mexico in the second quarter of 2008, earned incremental revenues of $18.9 million in the GOM in 2009 prior to its relocation to the Brazil market late in the second quarter of 2009. During 2008, we had three rigs at various times either operating or undergoing surveys or shipyard projects in the GOM compared with only two rigs operating in the GOM for all or part of 2009. The decrease in the number of rigs in the GOM between 2008 and 2009, combined with the absence of survey related costs in 2009, resulted in a $12.7 million reduction in operating costs in the region compared to the prior year. Mexico. Revenues generated and contract drilling expense incurred by our intermediate semisubmersibles operating offshore Mexico decreased $3.1 million and $7.4 million, respectively, during 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean Ambassador to the GOM, which resulted in a reduction in 2009 revenues and operating expenses of $13.2 million and $8.0 million, respectively. The decline in 2009 revenues was partially offset by an increase in average operating revenue per day in 2009 compared to 2008 for both of our intermediate semisubmersibles operating for PEMEX as a result of an unfavorable reserve for disputed downtime recorded in December 2008. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Operating revenue for our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the Australia/Asia/Middle East region increased $28.0 million in 2009 compared to 2008. An increase in average operating revenue per day from $306,600 in 2008 to $333,700 in 2009 generated additional revenues of $41.6 million in 2009. Average utilization of our intermediate semisubmersible fleet in the region remained constant at 87% for both 2008 and 2009; however, downtime incurred in 2009, combined with reduced dayrates earned by the individual rigs, resulted in a $9.1 million reduction in 2009 revenues compared to 2008. The Ocean Bounty was stacked after completion of its contract offshore Australia at the beginning of the third quarter of 2009, resulting in a $40.6 million reduction in revenues compared to 2008. The negative impact on revenues from stacking the Ocean Bounty was partially offset by an increase in rig operating days for the Ocean Patriot and Ocean General that resulted in the generation of $34.6 million in incremental revenues during 2009. Contract drilling expense for the Australia/Asia/Middle East region decreased $21.5 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to the absence of costs associated with the 2008 special surveys of the Ocean Patriot and Ocean General and reduced costs for the Ocean Bounty, which completed drilling operations offshore Australia in July 2009. Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. Operating revenue for our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean region decreased $36.4 million in 2009 compared to 2008. Our North Sea fleet (both U.K. and Norwegian sectors) generated $14.8 million less in revenues in 2009 compared to 2008 due to 129 fewer rig operating days in 2009 compared to 2008. Rig operating days decreased in 2009 as a result of the early termination of a drilling contract for the Ocean Nomad and intermittent work for the Ocean Guardian prior to its departure for the Falkland Islands, partially offset by reduced downtime for the Ocean Princess, which completed its 2008 special survey in early 2009. The impact of the reduction in rig operating days was partially offset by an increase in average operating revenue per day for our North Sea fleet from $321,200 in 2008 to $344,000 in 2009. The Ocean Lexington operated offshore Egypt during 2008 through August 2009, and in September 2009, the rig was mobilized to a shipyard in Cadiz, Spain for contract preparation activities in connection with a contract offshore Brazil. Revenues generated by the Ocean Lexington in 2009 decreased $21.6 million compared to 2008 due to 103 fewer rig operating days in 2009, partially offset by higher average operating revenue per day earned in 2009 as compared to the prior year. At December 31, 2009, the Ocean Lexington was en route to Brazil. Contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean markets decreased $30.2 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to lower labor and personnel related costs for our rigs operating in the North Sea, including the reversal of a previously recorded reserve for paid time off for our U.K. national employees, and reduced costs associated with regulatory surveys due to fewer rigs undergoing surveys in 2009 than in 2008. In addition, operating costs in this region decreased as a result of the relocation of the Ocean Lexington to a Spanish shipyard in September 2009. 30 Table of Contents South America. Revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the South American region increased $83.5 million in 2009 compared to 2008. At December 31, 2009, we had seven intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating offshore Brazil and another rig, the intermediate semisubmersible Ocean Lexington, undergoing contract modification activities and mobilizing to Brazil. During 2009, our Brazilian intermediate semisubmersible fleet logged 1,996 rig operating days and earned average operating revenue per day of $217,400 compared to 1,425 rig operating days and average operating revenue per day of $177,600 in 2008. This increase in rig operating days and average operating revenue per day for our operations offshore Brazil combined to generate additional revenues of $185.4 million in 2009 compared to 2008. During 2008, the Ocean Worker earned $101.9 million operating offshore Trinidad and Tobago prior to mobilizing to Brazil in the third quarter of 2008. The Ocean Worker did not begin drilling operations offshore Brazil until March 2009. Contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersibles operating in the South American region increased $48.3 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in costs in the South American region reflects the increase in number of rigs in the region, including higher maintenance and other costs associated with customer acceptance testing and the amortization of costs associated with the mobilization of our rigs into the region, shorebase support costs and revenue based agency fees. In addition, the increased operating costs reflect higher freight and customs charges that are inherent in operations in the region. Jack Ups.

Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the GOM decreased $126.5 million during 2009 compared to 2008. Average utilization decreased from 91% in 2008 to 39% in 2009 due to a decrease in demand for rigs in the GOM, and resulted in a $90.9 million decrease in revenues. Our jack up fleet in the GOM had 1,011 ready and cold stacked days during 2009 compared to 22 ready stacked days in 2008. In addition, we relocated the Ocean Summit to Mexico for a contract with PEMEX at the beginning of the third quarter of 2009. The Ocean Tower, prior to being taken out of service due to damage sustained in a hurricane in the third quarter of 2008, generated revenues of $34.3 million in 2008. As a result of the depressed GOM market, in 2009 we elected to cold stack and no longer actively market our three mat supported jack ups in this region. 31 Table of Contents Contract drilling expense for our jack ups operating in the GOM decreased $27.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to significantly reduced operating costs for the Ocean Tower (prior to its sale in October 2009) and our three cold stacked rigs. The decline in operating costs was partially offset by 2009 survey and repair costs for the Ocean Titan and Ocean Summit and demobilization costs for the Ocean Columbia associated with its relocation from Mexico to the GOM in the fourth quarter of 2009 for a shipyard project. Mexico. Revenue and contract drilling expense generated by our jack up rigs operating in Mexico increased $0.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively. The relatively stable revenues generated by our jack up fleet offshore Mexico reflects incremental revenues generated by the Ocean Summit beginning in the third quarter of 2009, partly offset by a reduction in revenues generated by the Ocean Columbia, which completed its contract with PEMEX at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2009. Revenues were further reduced, compared to 2008, due to a contract extension for the Ocean Nugget until 2011, but at a lower dayrate than it previously earned. The increase in contract drilling expense was primarily due to contract preparations and customer acceptance of the Ocean Summit, as well as the inclusion of normal operating costs, partially offset by lower operating costs for the Ocean Columbia due to its relocation to the GOM. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the Australia/Asia/Middle East region increased $48.2 million in 2009 compared to 2008, including $57.3 million of incremental revenues earned by the Ocean Shield, which began operating in the region late in the second quarter of 2008. The Ocean Heritage, which generated $11.8 million in revenues in 2008, completed its contract offshore Qatar during the first quarter of 2008 and was relocated to Egypt in late June 2008. Contract drilling expense in the Australia/Asia/Middle East region increased $7.9 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating costs for the Ocean Shield for a full year in 2009 and costs associated with a survey and shipyard project for the Ocean Sovereign. The increased costs were partially offset by the absence of operating costs for the Ocean Heritage in 2009. Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. Revenues generated by our jack up rigs operating in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean region decreased $22.6 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to an $18.2 million reduction in revenues generated by the Ocean Spur in 2009. The Ocean Spur operated offshore Egypt during both 2009 and 2008; however, average operating revenue per day for the Ocean Spur decreased to $107,700 in 2009 from $152,700 in 2008, while utilization increased to nearly 100% in 2009 compared to 91% in 2008. During 2008, we recognized a $6.5 million lump sum demobilization fee earned by the Ocean Spur upon completion of its initial contract offshore Egypt. The $3.8 million increase in operating expense in the region in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full year of operating costs in 2009 for the Ocean Heritage, which relocated from Qatar in the second quarter of 2008. South America. Our newly constructed jack up rig, the Ocean Scepter, began operating offshore Argentina late in the third quarter of 2008. Our operations offshore Argentina generated $54.9 million in revenues and incurred $36.3 million in contract drilling expense during 2009. The Ocean Scepter completed its contract in July 2009. Other Contract Drilling Expense. Other contract drilling expense increased $11.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in labor and overhead costs associated with rig based training and a higher usage of fleet spare parts and supplies inventories. Bad Debt Expense. In December 2008, we recorded a $31.9 million provision for bad debts to reserve the uncollected balance of one of our customers in the U.K. that had entered into administration (a U.K. insolvency proceeding similar to U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy). In December 2009, we recorded a $10.7 million provision for bad debts to reserve a portion of the uncollected balance of receivables related to our operations in Egypt and recovered $0.9 million associated with the reserve for bad debts recorded in 2008. 32 Table of Contents Casualty Loss. During 2008, we wrote off certain equipment that was damaged during Hurricane Ike, including the net book value of approximately $2.6 million of the Ocean Towers derrick, drill floor and related equipment lost in the storm, and we accrued $3.7 million in estimated salvage costs for recovery of equipment from the ocean floor. Gain on Disposition of Assets. Net gain on disposition of assets in 2009 includes a $6.7 million gain on the sale of the Ocean Tower compared to aggregate net gains of $2.8 million in 2008 on the sale and disposition of miscellaneous equipment. Interest Income. We earned interest income of $4.5 million in 2009 compared to $11.7 million in 2008. The $7.2 million decrease in interest income is primarily the result of lower average interest bearing cash balances during 2009 compared to 2008. Interest Expense. Interest expense in 2009 and 2008 relates primarily to interest accrued on our outstanding indebtedness, net of capitalized interest, and our liabilities for uncertain tax positions. During 2009, we incurred interest expense of $19.6 million related to our 5.875% Senior Notes issued in May 2009 and $6.6 million related to our 5.70% Senior Notes issued in October 2009 partially offset by a net $3.4 million reduction in accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions. See Income Tax Expense.. During 2008, we capitalized interest of $16.9 million related to qualifying construction projects and major upgrades that were all completed in 2008. We did not capitalize interest costs in 2009 as there were no qualifying activities during 2009. Foreign Currency Transaction Gain (Loss). Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) include both realized and unrealized gains and losses from the settlement of and from mark to market accounting for our foreign currency forward exchange, or FOREX, contracts that we have not designated as accounting hedges. Such gains and losses fluctuate based on the level of transactions in foreign currencies, as well as fluctuations in such currencies. Prior to May 1, 2009, we did not designate any of our FOREX contracts as accounting hedges. During 2009, we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of $11.5 million, including $8.9 million realized and unrealized gains on FOREX contracts ($37.3 million in net unrealized gains from mark to market accounting and $28.4 million in net realized losses on settled FOREX contracts) and net gains of $2.6 million on other foreign currency transactions. During 2008, we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of $65.6 million, including $54.0 million in net losses on FOREX contracts ($37.2 million in net unrealized losses from mark to market accounting and $16.8 million in net realized losses on settlement of FOREX contracts) and other net foreign currency transaction losses of $11.6 million. Income Tax Expense. Our income tax expense is a function of the mix between our domestic and international pre tax earnings or losses, respectively, as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognized $492.2 million of tax expense on pre tax income of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to tax expense of $536.5 million on pre tax income of $1.8 billion in 2008. Certain of our international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited, or DOIL, a Cayman Islands subsidiary which we wholly own. Since forming this subsidiary in 2002, it has been our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the subsidiary to finance foreign activities. Consequently, no U.S. federal income taxes are provided on these earnings except to the extent that such earnings were immediately subject to U.S. federal income taxes and except for the earnings of Diamond East Asia Limited, or DEAL, a wholly owned subsidiary of DOIL formed in December 2008. It is our intention to repatriate the earnings of DEAL and, accordingly, U.S. income taxes are provided on its earnings. The effective annual tax rate of 26.3% in 2009 compared favorably to the effective annual tax rate of 29.1% in 2008 primarily because of higher earnings of DOIL in 2009 which were taxed at lower rates. 33 Table of Contents Our income tax returns are subject to review and examination in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and we are currently contesting various tax assessments. We accrue for income tax contingencies, or uncertain tax positions, that we believe are more likely than not exposures. We recognized expense of $3.3 million and $3.4 million for uncertain tax positions in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2009 we recorded a net reduction to interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $3.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized $0.8 million of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions. Penalty related tax expense for uncertain tax positions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $4.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. On March 31, 2009, the statute of limitations relative to a 2003 uncertain tax position in Mexico expired. As a consequence, we reversed $5.5 million of previously accrued interest expense and $5.9 million of previously accrued tax expense, $0.8 million of which had been accrued for penalties. In December 2009 we received an approximately $26 million assessment from the Brazilian tax authorities for the years 2004 and 2005. We contested the tax assessment in January 2010 and are awaiting the outcome of the appeal. As required by GAAP, only the portion of the tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement is to be recognized. Consequently, we have accrued approximately $7 million of expense attributable to the portion of the tax assessment we determined to be an uncertain tax position in our 2009 Consolidated Statements of Operations, of which approximately $2 million was interest related and approximately $2 million was penalty related. 34 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 Comparative data relating to our revenue and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below.

Because of our contracted revenue backlog, however, our results were not greatly impacted by these market conditions during the fourth quarter of 2008. The high overall utilization and historically high dayrates for our floater fleet contributed to an overall increase in our revenues of $891.9 million, or 43%, to $3.0 billion in 2008 compared to $2.1 billion in 2007. Total contract drilling revenues in 2008 increased $970.8 million, or 39% compared to 2007, to $3.5 billion. Average realized dayrates in 2008 in many of our floater markets increased as our rigs operated under contracts at higher dayrates than those earned during 2007, which resulted in the generation of additional contract drilling revenues. However, overall revenue increases for our floater fleet were negatively impacted by the effect of 35 Table of Contents downtime associated with scheduled shipyard projects and mandatory inspections or surveys. In addition, the GOM jack up market, which had improved in early 2008 compared to the prior year, experienced reduced demand and dayrates by the end of 2008. The international jack up market, which had been strong throughout the majority of 2008, also began to reflect softening demand and reduced dayrates by the end of 2008. Our GOM and international jack up fleets earned lower dayrates during 2008 compared to 2007 despite a fleet wide increase in utilization during 2008. Total contract drilling expense increased $181.2 million, or 18%, in 2008 compared to 2007. Overall cost increases for maintenance and repairs between the 2008 and 2007 periods reflected the impact of high, sustained utilization of our drilling units across our fleet, additional survey and related maintenance costs, contract preparation and mobilization costs, as well as the inclusion of normal operating costs for the Ocean Endeavor, Ocean Shield and Ocean Scepter. The increase in overall operating and overhead costs also reflected the impact of higher prices throughout the offshore drilling industry and its support businesses, including higher costs associated with hiring and retaining skilled personnel for our worldwide offshore fleet. Depreciation expense increased $51.7 million to $287.4 million during 2008, or 22% compared to 2007, due to a higher depreciable asset base. Our results during 2008 were negatively impacted by $54.0 million in losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as accounting hedges included in Foreign currency transaction gain (loss), a $31.9 million provision for bad debt expense related to one of our North Sea semisubmersible rigs that was contracted to a U.K. customer that had entered into administration under U.K. law and the recognition of a casualty loss aggregating $6.3 million in connection with damages sustained from Hurricane Ike.

Revenues generated by our high specification floaters operating in the GOM increased $217.4 million in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to higher average dayrates earned during 2008 ($131.7 million). Average operating revenue per day for our rigs in this market, excluding the Ocean Endeavor, increased to $413,300 during 2008 compared to $354,400 in 2007. Excluding the Ocean Endeavor, six of our seven other high specification semisubmersible rigs in the GOM were operating at higher dayrates in 2008 than those earned during 2007. The Ocean Endeavor began operating in the GOM during the third quarter of 2007 and generated additional revenues of $49.7 million during 2008 compared to 2007. Average utilization for our high specification rigs operating in the GOM, excluding the Ocean Endeavor, increased slightly from 87% in 2007 to 91% in 2008, and generated $36.0 million in additional revenues in 2008. The increase in utilization in 2008 was attributable to 88 fewer downtime days during 2008 compared to 2007 when rigs were down, primarily for regulatory inspections and repairs. 36 Table of Contents Operating costs during 2008 for our high specification floaters in the GOM increased $17.6 million to $224.0 million (including $11.3 million in incremental operating expenses for the Ocean Endeavor) compared to 2007. Operating costs for 2008 reflected higher labor, benefits and other personnel related costs, higher maintenance and other project costs and higher property insurance costs, partially offset by lower mobilization and other inspection related costs for these rigs compared to 2007. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Revenues generated by the Ocean Rover, our high specification rig operating offshore Malaysia, decreased $3.6 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The revenue decrease was primarily due to scheduled downtime (67 days) for a survey and maintenance, partially offset by the effect of a higher average dayrate earned during 2008 compared to 2007. Contract drilling expenses for the Ocean Rover increased $8.7 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to costs associated with the rigs 2008 survey and other maintenance and repair costs and, to a lesser extent, higher labor, benefits and other personnel related costs. South America. Revenues earned by our high specification floaters operating offshore Brazil during 2008 increased $77.4 million compared to 2007. Average operating revenue per day increased from $185,300 during 2007 to $339,700 during 2008, and generated additional revenues of $92.3 million. Utilization in 2008 decreased to 81% from 92% in 2007 primarily as the result of 99 days of incremental unpaid downtime for the Ocean Clipper for a special survey and repairs to its propulsion system. The decline in utilization reduced revenues by $14.9 million in 2008. Contract drilling expense for our operations in Brazil increased $22.7 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in costs was primarily due to inspection and repair costs for the Ocean Clipper and higher revenue based agency fees and personnel and related costs during 2008, as compared to 2007.

Revenues generated during 2008 by our intermediate semisubmersible fleet operating in the GOM decreased $35.6 million compared to 2007, primarily as a result of the relocation of three of our rigs from the GOM (Ocean Voyager and Ocean New Era to Mexico and Ocean Concord to Brazil) in the fourth quarter of 2007. During 2007, these three rigs generated revenues of $128.9 million while operating in the GOM. 37 Table of Contents The negative impact on revenues of the departure of these rigs was partially offset by $65.6 million and $27.8 million in additional revenues generated by the Ocean Saratoga and the Ocean Ambassador, respectively, during 2008 compared to 2007. The additional contribution by the Ocean Saratoga was primarily due to the rig operating at a higher dayrate that began in the fourth quarter of 2007 and increased utilization during 2008 compared to 2007, when the rig was out of service for 116 days to complete a service life extension project. We relocated the Ocean Ambassador to the GOM from Mexico during the second quarter of 2008. Contract drilling expenses in the GOM decreased by $34.4 million during 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the absence of operating costs for the Ocean Voyager, Ocean New Era and Ocean Concord ($47.9 million) which relocated to other markets during 2007 and costs associated with shipyard projects for the Ocean Whittington and Ocean Worker ($16.8 million) that were completed in 2007 prior to relocating these rigs to the South America region. The overall decrease in contract drilling expenses in 2008 was partially offset by the inclusion of normal operating expenses and special survey costs for the Ocean Ambassador ($21.8 million). Also included in operating expenses for 2008 was $3.2 million in maintenance and other costs associated with contract preparation activities for the Ocean Yorktown prior to its mobilization to Brazil in May 2008. Mexico. Offshore Mexico, three of our intermediate semisubmersible rigs completed their contracts with PEMEX after the second quarter of 2007 and relocated out of the region. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we relocated two semisubmersible units, the Ocean New Era and Ocean Voyager, from the GOM to Mexico. Average operating revenue per day for our rigs working offshore Mexico increased to $277,900 for 2008 compared to $98,900 per day for 2007 primarily because these two new rigs in the region worked for PEMEX at dayrates substantially higher than average rates earned during 2007. Higher dayrates, partially offset by the net reduction in the number of rigs between periods, generated $134.6 million of additional revenues during 2008 compared to 2007. Contract drilling expenses for the Mexico region decreased $9.5 million during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the effect on operating costs of the net reduction of one rig in the region, partially offset by higher maintenance costs and revenue based agency fees. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the Australia/Asia/Middle East region generated revenues of $395.1 million during 2008 compared to revenues of $239.2 million in 2007. The $155.9 million increase in operating revenue was primarily due to an increase in average operating revenue per day from $171,500 during 2007 to $306,600 during 2008, which generated additional revenues of $171.0 million during 2008. Average utilization in this region decreased to 87% during 2008 from 94% during 2007, resulting in a $15.1 million reduction in revenues during 2008. The decrease in utilization was primarily the result of 170 days of scheduled downtime for special surveys and repairs for three of our rigs in this region during 2008. Contract drilling expense for the Australia/Asia/Middle East region increased $28.5 million in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to inspection and related repair costs associated with special surveys during 2008. In addition, normal operating costs for the Ocean Patriot were higher during 2008 when the rig operated offshore Australia compared to operating offshore New Zealand during 2007. Operating costs in this region also reflected higher labor and personnel related costs during 2008 compared to the prior year. Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. Operating revenue for our intermediate semisubmersibles in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean region increased $117.6 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to higher dayrates earned by our four rigs in the North Sea (both U.K. and Norwegian sectors). Average operating revenue per day for our North Sea semisubmersibles increased from $211,500 during 2007 to $321,200 during 2008, and contributed $144.7 million in additional revenue in 2008 compared to the prior year. The increase in revenue was partially offset by the impact of 126 days of incremental downtime during 2008 primarily associated with surveys of our U.K. rigs. The decrease in utilization reduced revenues by $27.4 million during 2008 compared to 2007. Contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean markets increased $24.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the inclusion of costs associated with surveys of our rigs operating in the U.K. sector of the North Sea. In addition, during 2008, all of our rigs in this market incurred higher overall costs, primarily for labor and benefits and repairs. Operating costs for 2008 included additional costs for the Ocean Vanguard which operated offshore Ireland for a portion of 2008. 38 Table of Contents South America. Revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the South American region increased $228.1 million during 2008 compared to 2007. During 2008, six of our rigs operated in the region compared to four rigs during 2007. Following the first quarter of 2007, we relocated the Ocean Whittington and Ocean Concord to Brazil and the Ocean Worker to Trinidad and Tobago where they generated additional aggregate revenues of $196.2 million in 2008. The Ocean Yorktown began operating in Brazil during the third quarter of 2008 and generated $30.4 million in revenues. Operating expenses for our operations in the South American region increased $89.8 million in 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating costs for two of the rigs transferred to this region ($48.1 million) and incremental operating costs for the Ocean Worker and Ocean Whittington ($38.6 million) which only operated in the South American region for a portion of 2007. Operating expenses for 2008 also reflected higher labor and other personnel related expenses, freight and repair and maintenance costs for our other two semisubmersible rigs in this market. Jack Ups. Year Ended December 31, Favorable/ 2008 2007 (Unfavorable) (In thousands) JACK UPS: CONTRACT DRILLING REVENUE GOM $ 189,500 $ 222,276 $ (32,776 ) Mexico 105,055 62,451 42,604 Australia/Asia/Middle East 92,596 88,497 4,099 Europe/Africa/Mediterranean 115,652 72,880 42,772 South America 22,131 22,131 Total Contract Drilling Revenue $ 524,934 $ 446,104 $ 78,830 CONTRACT DRILLING EXPENSE GOM $ 99,533 $ 119,216 $ 19,683 Mexico 33,303 16,108 (17,195 ) Australia/Asia/Middle East 42,184 28,214 (13,970 ) Europe/Africa/Mediterranean 35,058 19,486 (15,572 ) South America 14,287 (14,287 ) Total Contract Drilling Expense $ 224,365 $ 183,024 $ (41,341 ) OPERATING INCOME $ 300,569 $ 263,080 $ 37,489 GOM. Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the GOM decreased $32.8 million during 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean King (Croatia) and the Ocean Columbia (Mexico) after the second quarter of 2007. These two rigs generated $42.1 million in revenues while operating in the GOM during 2007. In addition, average operating revenue per day, excluding the Ocean King and Ocean Columbia, decreased to $80,800 in 2008 from $90,500 during 2007 and resulted in an additional $18.3 million decrease in revenue from the prior year. Average utilization (excluding the Ocean King and Ocean Columbia) increased from 78% during 2007 to 92% during 2008, resulting in an increase in revenues of $32.5 million. The increase in utilization was primarily due to an improvement in market conditions in the GOM during 2008 compared to 2007 that resulted in fewer ready stack days for our jack up fleet between wells during 2008 (22 days) compared to 2007 (306 days). However, revenues decreased $4.8 million as a result of the Ocean Tower being taken out of service due to damages sustained during Hurricane Ike in the third quarter of 2008, which partially offset the favorable effect of increased utilization in 2008. Contract drilling expense in the GOM decreased $19.7 million during 2008 compared to 2007. The overall decrease in operating costs during 2008 was due to the absence of operating costs in the GOM for the Ocean King and Ocean Columbia ($21.8 million). The reduction in overall operating costs was partially offset by costs associated with a regulatory survey for one of our GOM jack ups, higher labor and benefits costs and higher overhead costs for our remaining rigs in the GOM during 2008 compared to 2007. 39 Table of Contents Mexico. Revenue and contract drilling expense from our rigs operating in Mexico increased $42.6 million and $17.2 million, respectively, in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the operation of the Ocean Columbia offshore Mexico, which began in the first quarter of 2008. The Ocean Columbia generated $42.0 million in revenues and incurred $17.1 million in operating expenses during 2008. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the Australia/Asia/Middle East region increased $4.1 million during 2008 compared to 2007. Our newly constructed jack up rig, the Ocean Shield, began work offshore Malaysia during the second quarter of 2008 and generated $39.0 million in revenues during 2008. In addition, the Ocean Sovereign, which operated offshore Indonesia in 2008, generated additional revenues of $8.4 million due to an increase in the operating dayrate earned by the rig beginning late in the second quarter of 2008. These favorable contributions to revenue in the region were partially offset by a decrease in revenue generated by the Ocean Heritage, which was ready stacked in a shipyard in Qatar from March 2008 through late June 2008 until it was subsequently relocated out of the region to Egypt. Contract drilling expense in the Australia/Asia/Middle East region increased by $14.0 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating costs for the Ocean Shield and higher labor, benefits, repair and other operating costs for the Ocean Sovereign. These cost increases were partially offset by the absence of operating costs for the Ocean Heritage due to its relocation to Egypt. Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean region increased $42.8 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The Ocean King, operating under a two year bareboat charter offshore Croatia that began in the third quarter of 2007, generated revenues of $37.8 million during 2008. In addition, the Ocean Heritage, which relocated to Egypt during the third quarter of 2008, generated $17.0 million of revenues in the region. Revenues were negatively impacted by the Ocean Spur, which operated offshore Egypt all of 2008 and in both Tunisia and Egypt in 2007. The Ocean Spur generated $12.0 million less in revenues during 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the recognition of other operating revenues associated with its contract offshore Tunisia during 2007. Contract drilling expense in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean region increased by $15.6 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating costs for the Ocean Heritage that began in the third quarter of 2008 and, to a lesser extent, operating expenses associated with the Ocean Kings bareboat charter for the entire 2008 period. South America. Our newly constructed jack up rig, the Ocean Scepter, began operating offshore Argentina during the third quarter of 2008 and generated $22.1 million in revenues and incurred $14.3 million in contract drilling expenses during 2008. Other Contract Drilling. Other contract drilling expenses decreased $7.8 million during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to insurance proceeds received in 2008 related to claims filed in connection with the 2005 Hurricane Katrina. These costs had previously been expensed due to uncertainty of recovery from insurance. Depreciation. Depreciation expense increased $51.7 million to $287.4 million in 2008 compared to $235.7 million in 2007 primarily due to depreciation associated with capital additions in 2007 and 2008, which included a partial years depreciation of our two newly constructed jack ups, the Ocean Shield and Ocean Scepter. General and Administrative Expense. We incurred general and administrative expense of $60.1 million in 2008 compared to $53.5 million in 2007. The $6.7 million increase in overhead costs between the periods was primarily due to an increase in payroll costs as a result of higher compensation and staffing increases, travel and related costs and engineering and tax consulting fees. These cost increases were partially offset by a reduction in legal fees due to a 2008 insurance reimbursement related to certain litigation. 40 Table of Contents Bad Debt Expense. We recorded a provision for bad debt expense of $31.9 million in 2008 related to one of our North Sea semisubmersible rigs contracted to a U.K. customer that entered into administration under U.K. law. Casualty Loss. During September 2008, one of our jack up rigs, the Ocean Tower, sustained significant damage during Hurricane Ike. As a result of this damage, we wrote off the net book value of the Ocean Towers derrick, drill floor and related equipment lost in the storm of approximately $2.6 million and accrued $3.7 million in estimated salvage costs for recovery of equipment from the ocean floor. Gain on Disposition of Assets. We recognized a net gain of $2.8 million on the sale and disposition of assets in 2008 compared to a net gain of $8.6 million in 2007 primarily for the recognition of gains on insurance settlements and from sales of used equipment. Interest Income. Our interest income decreased $21.8 million to $11.7 million in 2008 from $33.6 million in 2007, primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our invested cash balances in 2008 compared to 2007. Interest Expense. We recorded interest expense of $10.1 million in 2008 compared to $21.9 million in 2007. Interest expense in 2007 included $9.2 million in debt issuance costs that we wrote off in connection with conversions during the period of our 1.5% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2031 and our Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures due 2020, or Zero Coupon Debentures, into shares of our common stock. We wrote off $84,000 in debt issuance costs during 2008 related to conversions during the year. Foreign Currency Transaction Gain (Loss). Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) include gains and losses from the settlement of foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as accounting hedges and fluctuate based on the level of transactions in foreign currencies, as well as fluctuations in such currencies. During 2008, we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of $65.6 million, including $54.0 million in net losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts ($37.2 million in net unrealized losses resulting from mark to market accounting on our open positions at December 31, 2008 and $16.8 million in net realized losses on settlement of forward contracts). During 2007, we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of $2.9 million. Income Tax Expense. Our income tax expense is a function of the mix between our domestic and international pre tax earnings or losses, respectively, as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognized $536.5 million of tax expense on pre tax income of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to tax expense of $398.9 million on a pre tax income of $1.2 billion in 2007. Certain of our international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by DOIL, a Cayman Islands subsidiary which we wholly own. Since forming this subsidiary in 2002, it has been our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the subsidiary to finance foreign activities. Consequently, no U.S. federal income taxes were provided on these earnings in years subsequent to 2002 except to the extent that such earnings were immediately subject to U.S. federal income taxes. In December 2007, DOIL made a non recurring distribution of $850.0 million to its U.S. parent, a portion of which consisted of earnings of the subsidiary that had not previously been subjected to U.S. federal income tax. We recognized $58.6 million of U.S. federal income tax expense in 2007 as a result of the distribution. Notwithstanding the non recurring distribution made in December 2007, it remains our intention to indefinitely reinvest future earnings of DOIL to finance foreign activities except for the earnings of 41 Table of Contents DEAL, a wholly owned subsidiary of DOIL formed in December 2008. It is our intention to repatriate the earnings of DEAL and, accordingly, U.S. income taxes are provided on its earnings. Our income tax returns are subject to review and examination in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and we are currently contesting various tax assessments. We accrue for income tax contingencies, or uncertain tax positions, that we believe are more likely than not exposures. We recognized expense of $3.4 million and $3.7 million for uncertain tax positions in 2008 and 2007, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we recognized $0.8 million and $1.7 million of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions, respectively. Penalty related tax expense for uncertain tax positions during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $1.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from our operations and our cash reserves. We may also make use of our $285 million credit facility for cash liquidity. See $285 Million Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2009, we had $376.4 million in Cash and cash equivalents and $400.9 million in Investments and marketable securities, representing our investment of cash available for current operations. Cash Flows from Operations. Our cash flows from operations are impacted by the ability of our customers to weather the continuing global financial crisis and restrictions in the credit market, as well as the volatility in energy prices. In general, before working for a customer with whom we have not had a prior business relationship and or whose financial stability may appear uncertain to us, we perform a credit review on that company. Based on that analysis, we may require that the customer present a letter of credit, prepay or provide other credit enhancements. If a potential customer is unable to obtain an adequate level of credit, it may preclude us from doing business with that potential customer. The global financial crisis could also have an impact on our existing customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us or attempt to renegotiate existing contract terms. In addition, we may offer inducements to our customers to extend existing contracts. For example, during the second half of 2009, we reached an agreement with one of our customers in the GOM for a second one year contract extension. In exchange for the extension, we agreed to a varying dayrate structure which provides for lower dayrates during the four month period when the rig is restricted from operating during hurricane season, and higher dayrates at other times. During the second quarter of 2009, one of our customers sought short term financial relief with respect to an existing contractual agreement with us for a six well, one year minimum contract term, program that began in May 2009. As a result, we agreed to amend our existing contract with this customer, and in consideration of this amendment, we are to receive a $20,000 per day increase in the total contractual operating dayrate, to a total of $560,000 per day, for a minimum of the first 240 days of the initial one year contract. Under the terms of the amended agreement, the customer is obligated to pay us $75,000 per day in accordance with our normal credit terms (due 30 days after receipt of invoice). The remainder of the dayrate for the six well program (minimum of 240 days) will be paid through the conveyance of a 27% net profits interest, or NPI, in a minimum of five developmental oil and gas producing properties covering six wells owned by the customer. Based on the current production payout estimate, we anticipate that the first payment from the conveyance of the NPI will commence in early 2010. Payments of such amounts, and the timing of such payments, are contingent upon such production and upon energy sale prices. The residual days under the initial one year (365 day) contract will be deferred until the fourth quarter of 2011 when the customer will utilize the rig at the originally contracted dayrate and provide a 25% up front escrow payment with the remaining 75% to be paid in accordance with normal credit terms. At December 31, 2009, the portion of our trade receivable that is expected to be paid from the NPI was $70.5 million and is presented as Accounts Receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report. These external factors which affect our cash flows from operations are not within our control and are difficult to predict. For a description of other factors that could affect our cash flows from operations, see Overview Industry Conditions, Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. $285 Million Revolving Credit Facility. We maintain a $285 million syndicated, senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility, for general corporate purposes, including loans and performance or standby letters of credit, that will mature on November 2, 2011. 42 Table of Contents Loans under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, either (i) the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin, varying from 0.20% to 0.525%, based on our current credit ratings. Under our Credit Facility, we also pay, based on our current credit ratings, and as applicable, other customary fees, including, but not limited to, a facility fee on the total commitment under the Credit Facility regardless of usage and a utilization fee that applies if the aggregate of all loans outstanding under the Credit Facility equals or exceeds 50% of the total commitment under the facility. Changes in credit ratings could lower or raise the fees that we pay under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, the maintenance of a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization, as defined in the Credit Facility, of not more than 60% at the end of each fiscal quarter and limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations, liquidation and dissolution, changes in lines of business, swap agreements, transactions with affiliates and subsidiary indebtedness. Based on our current credit ratings at December 31, 2009, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans would have been 0.24%. As of December 31, 2009, there were no loans outstanding under the Credit Facility; however $63.3 million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the Credit Facility. Liquidity and Capital Requirements Our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements. We determine the amount of cash required to meet our capital commitments by evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, including water depth and drilling capability upgrades. We believe that our operating cash flows and cash reserves will be sufficient to meet both our working capital requirements and our capital commitments over the next twelve months; however, we will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions and will adjust capital spending programs if required. In addition, we may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. Our ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity securities will be dependent on our results of operations, our current financial condition, current market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Additionally, we may also make use of our Credit Facility to finance capital expenditures or for other general corporate purposes. Contractual Cash Obligations. The following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2009. Payments Due By Period Less than After 5 Contractual Obligations Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years years (In thousands) Long term debt (principal and interest) $ 2,776,286 $ 87,661 $ 165,875 $ 415,875 $ 2,106,875 Operating leases 2,200 1,200 1,000 Total obligations $ 2,778,486 $ 88,861 $ 166,875 $ 415,875 $ 2,106,875 The above table excludes foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the aggregate notional amount of $114.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2009. See further information regarding these contracts in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Exchange Risk and Note 5 Derivative Financial Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. As of December 31, 2009, the total unrecognized tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions was $27.0 million. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with the liabilities recognized in this balance, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. We had no purchase obligations for major rig upgrades or any other significant obligations at December 31, 2009, except for those related to our direct rig operations, which arise during the normal course of business. 43 Table of Contents 5.70% Senior Notes On October 8, 2009, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.70% Senior Notes for general corporate purposes. The 5.70% Senior Notes were issued at an offering price of 99.344% of the principal and resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $496.7 million. These notes bear interest at 5.70% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning April 15, 2010, and mature on October 15, 2039. The 5.70% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and rank equal in right of payment to its existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future obligations of our subsidiaries. We have the right to redeem all or a portion of these notes for cash at any time or from time to time, on at least 15 days but not more than 60 days prior written notice, at the redemption price specified in the governing indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. 5.875% Senior Notes On May 4, 2009, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% Senior Notes for general corporate purposes. The 5.875% Senior Notes were issued at an offering price of 99.851% of the principal and resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $499.3 million. These notes bear interest at 5.875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, and mature on May 1, 2019. The 5.875% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and rank equal in right of payment to its existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future obligations of our subsidiaries. We have the right to redeem all or a portion of these notes for cash at any time or from time to time, on at least 15 days but not more than 60 days prior written notice, at the redemption price specified in the governing indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. See Note 10 Long Term Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of our 5.70% Senior Notes, 5.875% Senior Notes and our other long term debt. Other Commercial Commitments Letters of Credit. We were contingently liable as of December 31, 2009 in the amount of $166.6 million under certain performance, bid, supersedeas and custom bonds and letters of credit, including $63.3 million in letters of credit issued under our Credit Facility. Eight of these bonds totaling $103.1 million were purchased from a related party after obtaining competitive quotes. Agreements relating to approximately $95.7 million of performance bonds can require collateral at any time. As of December 31, 2009 we had not been required to make any collateral deposits with respect to these agreements. The remaining agreements cannot require collateral except in events of default. Banks have issued letters of credit on our behalf securing certain of these bonds. See Note 13 Related Party Transactions to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. The table below provides a list of these obligations in U.S. dollar equivalents and their time to expiration.

Our current credit rating is Baa1 for Moodys Investors Services and A for Standard Poors. Although our long term ratings continue at investment grade levels, lower ratings would result in higher rates for borrowings under our Credit Facility and could also result in higher interest rates on future debt issuances. 44 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures. During 2009, we spent approximately $1 billion toward the purchase of two new build, 7,500 foot semisubmersible drilling rigs, the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor, and the completion of the upgrade of the Ocean Monarch, which commenced drilling operations late in the first quarter of 2009. We spent an additional approximately $355 million in 2009 on our continuing rig capital maintenance program (other than rig upgrades and new construction) and to meet other corporate capital expenditure requirements. We have budgeted approximately $365 million on capital expenditures for 2010 associated with our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, equipment required for our long term international contracts and other corporate requirements. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $75 million in 2010 towards the commissioning and outfitting for service of the recently acquired Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor. We expect to finance our 2010 capital expenditures through the use of our existing cash balances or internally generated funds. From time to time, however, we may also make use of our Credit Facility to finance capital expenditures. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no off balance sheet debt or other arrangements. Historical Cash Flows The following is a discussion of our historical cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Change (In thousands) Net income $ 1,376,219 $ 1,310,547 $ 65,672 Net changes in operating assets and liabilities (286,069 ) (87,321 ) (198,748 ) Proceeds from settlement of FOREX contracts designated as accounting hedges 8,895 8,895 (Gain) loss on sale and disposition of assets, including casualty loss on Ocean Tower (7,902 ) 3,450 (11,352 ) Gain on sale of marketable securities (619 ) (1,282 ) 663 (Gain) loss on FOREX contracts (17,751 ) 54,010 (71,761 ) Deferred tax provision 85,524 61,404 24,120 Depreciation and other non cash items, net 358,517 278,880 79,637 $ 1,516,814 $ 1,619,688 $ (102,874 ) Our cash flows from operations in 2009 decreased to $1.5 billion compared to $1.6 billion in 2008, primarily due to an increase in cash required to satisfy working capital requirements in 2009 compared to 2008. Our working capital requirements used $286.1 million during 2009 compared to $87.3 million during 2008. The increase in cash required to satisfy working capital requirements is primarily due to an increase in our outstanding accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2009 compared to the prior year. Trade and other receivables used cash of $219.9 million in 2009 compared to $42.5 million in 2008. During 2009, the balance of our customer receivables increased due to higher average dayrates earned by certain of our rigs, the acceptance of an NPI to satisfy $70.5 million of a customer receivable (see Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows from Operations), as well as an increase in collection time for certain of our trade receivables. During 2008, we received insurance proceeds of $9.4 million related to the settlement of certain hurricane related insurance claims resulting from damages sustained in 2005. During 2009, we made U.S. federal income tax payments of $252.4 million compared to $393.2 million in 2008 for estimated U.S. federal income tax payments. We paid foreign income taxes, net of refunds, of $176.2 million and $120.7 million during 2009 and 2008, respectively. Beginning in May 2009, we began a hedging strategy and designated certain of our qualifying FOREX contracts as cash flow hedges. Realized gains or losses upon settlement of derivative contracts designated as cash 45 Table of Contents flow hedges are reported as a component of Contract drilling expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in our expenditures in local foreign currencies in the countries in which we operate. During 2009, we received $8.9 million in net proceeds on settlement of our FOREX contracts designated as accounting hedges. As of December 31, 2009, we had FOREX contracts outstanding, in the aggregate notional amount of $114.0 million, consisting of $37.6 million in Australian dollars, $42.6 million in Brazilian reais, $20.7 million in British pounds sterling, $5.3 million in Mexican pesos and $7.8 million in Norwegian kroner. These contracts settle at various times through September 2010. All of these contracts were designated as accounting hedges at December 31, 2009. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Change (In thousands) Purchase of marketable securities $ (4,473,575 ) $ (1,888,792 ) $ (2,584,783 ) Proceeds from sale of marketable securities 4,473,891 1,493,803 2,980,088 Capital expenditures (including rig acquisitions) (1,362,468 ) (666,857 ) (695,611 ) Proceeds from disposition of assets 40,462 5,881 34,581 Cost of settlement of FOREX contracts (28,445 ) (16,800 ) (11,645 ) $ (1,350,135 ) $ (1,072,765 ) $ (277,370 ) Our investing activities used $1.4 billion in 2009 compared to $1.1 billion in 2008. During 2008, we purchased marketable securities, net of sales, of $395.0 million compared to net sales of $0.3 million during 2009, but at a higher volume in 2009 than in the preceding year. Our level of investment activity is dependent on our working capital and other capital requirements during the year, as well as a response to actual or anticipated events or conditions in the securities markets. We spent $1.0 billion for the purchase of the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor and the completion of the major upgrade of the Ocean Monarch during 2009. We spent an additional $354.7 million in 2009 on our continuing rig capital maintenance program (other than rig upgrades and new construction) and to meet other corporate capital expenditure requirements. During 2008, we spent $181.9 million related to the major upgrade of the Ocean Monarch and construction of the Ocean Scepter and Ocean Shield and $485.0 million for our ongoing capital maintenance programs, including rig modifications to meet contractual requirements. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we completed the sale of the Ocean Tower and recognized proceeds, net of commissions, of $35.4 million. In 2008, we received a $3.5 million deposit related to the sale, which was reflected as a component of net cash provided by operating activities. Prior to May 2009, we entered into FOREX contracts as economic hedges of our foreign currency requirements; however, we did not designate these contracts as accounting hedges. During the latter part of 2008 and into the first five months of 2009, the strengthening U.S. dollar (or, conversely, the weakening foreign currency) negatively impacted these expiring FOREX contracts and resulted in aggregate, net realized losses of $28.4 million and $16.8 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. We have presented the settlement of these contracts within Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Change (In thousands) Issuance of senior unsecured debt $ 995,975 $ $ 995,975 Debt issue costs and arrangement fees (8,671 ) (8,671 ) Payment of dividends (1,115,211 ) (852,153 ) (263,058 ) Proceeds from stock options exercised 1,494 2,002 (508 ) Other 99 1,319 (1,220 ) $ (126,314 ) $ (848,832 ) $ 722,518 46 Table of Contents In 2009, we issued two tranches of senior, unsecured debt aggregating $1.0 billion for general corporate purposes and paid $8.7 million in fees related to these issuances. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements 5.70% Senior Notes and Liquidity and Capital Requirements 5.875% Senior Notes for a further discussion of these debt issuances. During 2009, we paid cash dividends totaling $1.1 billion, consisting of aggregate regular cash dividends of $69.5 million, or $0.125 per share of our common stock per quarter, and aggregate special cash dividends of $1.0 billion, or $1.875 per share of our common stock per quarter. During 2008, we paid cash dividends totaling $852.2 million, consisting of aggregate regular cash dividends of $69.5 million, or $0.125 per share of our common stock per quarter, and aggregate special cash dividends of $782.7 million ($1.25 per share of our common stock for each of the first three quarters of 2008 and $1.875 per share of our common stock during the final quarter of 2008). On February 3, 2010, we declared a regular quarterly cash dividend and a special cash dividend of $0.125 and $1.875, respectively, per share of our common stock. Both the quarterly and special cash dividends are payable on March 1, 2010 to stockholders of record on February 12, 2010. Our Board of Directors has adopted a policy to consider paying special cash dividends, in amounts to be determined, on a quarterly basis. Our Board of Directors may, in subsequent quarters, consider paying additional special cash dividends, in amounts to be determined, if it believes that our financial position, earnings, earnings outlook, capital spending plans and other relevant factors warrant such action at that time. Depending on market conditions, we may, from time to time, purchase shares of our common stock in the open market or otherwise. We did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Other Currency Risk. Some of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their operations in the local currency of the country where they conduct operations. Currency environments in which we have significant business operations include Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Australia and Malaysia. When possible, we attempt to minimize our currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to our estimated operating costs payable in local currency with the balance of the contract payable in U.S. dollars. At present, however, only a limited number of our contracts are payable both in U.S. dollars and the local currency. To the extent that we are not able to cover our local currency operating costs with customer payments in the local currency, we also utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce our currency exchange risk. Our forward currency exchange contracts may obligate us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specific dates or to net settle the spread between the contracted foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date, which, for most of our contracts, is the average spot rate for the contract period. We record currency transaction gains and losses, including gains and losses on settlement of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts, as Foreign currency transaction gain (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Standards Accounting Board, or FASB, has issued Accounting Standards Update 2010 06, or ASU 2010 06, that describes amendments to FASB Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 820 10 relating to fair value measurements. ASU 2010 06 amends the original codification to require additional disclosures regarding transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and activity within Level 3 fair value measurements. In addition, ASU 2010 06 clarifies existing disclosure requirements regarding the level of disaggregation of classes of assets and liabilities for which fair value measurements are disclosed, as well as disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques. This amendment is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for certain disclosures regarding Level 3 fair value measurements which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently reviewing the effect of these amendments; however, we do not expect the application of ASU 2010 06 to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position. 47 Table of Contents Forward Looking Statements We or our representatives may, from time to time, either in this report, in periodic press releases or otherwise, make or incorporate by reference certain written or oral statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The information included in this Item 7A is considered to constitute forward looking statements for purposes of the statutory safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements in Item 7 of this report. 49 Table of Contents Our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments. Market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. We believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur. Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by our senior management. Senior management approves the overall investment strategy that we employ and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to us. We may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. Our investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities. We monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates. The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity. The analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period. The sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly, the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our earnings or stockholders equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Loans under our $285 million syndicated, senior unsecured revolving Credit Facility bear interest at our option at a rate per annum equal to (i) the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (ii) LIBOR plus an applicable margin, varying from 0.20% to 0.525%, based on our current credit ratings. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, there were no loans outstanding under the Credit Facility (however, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, $63.3 million and $58.1 million, respectively, in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the Credit Facility). Our long term debt, as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates, and as such, interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of $136.2 million and $20.9 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. A 100 basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of $121.3 million and $21.6 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. It is customary for us to enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the normal course of business. These contracts may require us to exchange predetermined amounts of foreign currencies on specified dates or to net settle the spread between the contracted foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date, which, for most of our outstanding contracts, is the average spot rate for the contract period. As of December 31, 2009, we had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding, in the aggregate notional amount of $114.0 million, consisting of $37.6 million in Australian dollars, 50 Table of Contents $42.6 million in Brazilian reais, $20.7 million in British pounds sterling, $5.3 million in Mexican pesos and $7.8 million in Norwegian kroner. These contracts settle at various times through September 2010. At December 31, 2009, we have presented the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts as a current asset of $2.6 million in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and a current liability of $(0.2) million in Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report. We have presented the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts at December 31, 2008 as a current liability of $(37.3) million in Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their levels at December 31, 2009 and 2008. The following table presents our exposure to market risk by category (interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates): Fair Value Asset (Liability) Market Risk December 31, December 31, 2009 2008 2009 2008 (In thousands) Interest rate: Marketable securities $ 400,853 (a) $ 400,592 (a) $ (300 )(c) $ (2,000 )(c) Long term debt 1,546,900 (b) 470,000 (b) Foreign Exchange: Forward exchange contracts receivable positions 2,600 (d) (d) (17,600) (e) (e) Forward exchange contracts liability positions (200 )(d) (37,300 )(d) (3,700) (e) (32,600 )(e) (a) The fair market value of our investment in marketable securities, excluding repurchase agreements, is based on the quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2009 and 2008. (b) The fair values of our 4.875% Senior Notes due July 1, 2015 and 5.15% Senior Notes due September 1, 2014 are based on the quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. The fair value of our Zero Coupon Debentures is based on the closing market price of our common stock on December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. The fair values of our 5.70% Senior Notes and 5.875% Senior Notes are based on the quoted market prices on December 31, 2009. (c) The calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points at December 31, 2009 and 2008. (d) The fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is based on both quoted market prices and valuations derived from pricing models on December 31, 2009 and 2008. (e) The calculation of estimated foreign exchange risk assumes an instantaneous 20% decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their values at December 31, 2009 and 2008, with all other variables held constant. 51 Table of Contents
