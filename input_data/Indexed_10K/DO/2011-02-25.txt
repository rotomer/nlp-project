Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements (including the Notes thereto) in Item 8 of this report. We provide contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe and are a leader in offshore drilling. Our current fleet of 46 offshore drilling rigs consists of 32 semisubmersibles, 13 jack ups and one drillship. Overview Industry Conditions On October 12, 2010, the U.S. government lifted the ban on certain drilling activities in the GOM. All drilling in the GOM is now subject to compliance with enhanced safety requirements set forth in Notices to Lessees, or NTL, 2010 N05 and 2010 N06, both of which were implemented during the drilling ban. Additionally, all drilling in the GOM is required to comply with the Interim Final Rule to Enhance Safety Measures for Energy Development on the Outer Continental Shelf (Drilling Safety Rule) and the Workplace Safety Rule on Safety and Environmental Management Systems, which have become final, as well as NTL 2010 N10 (known as the Compliance and Review NTL). We continue to evaluate these new measures to ensure that our rigs and equipment are in full compliance, where applicable. Additional requirements could be forthcoming based on further recommendations by regulatory agencies investigating the Macondo incident. We are not able to predict the likelihood, nature or extent of additional rulemaking. Nor are we able to predict when the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or BOEMRE, will issue drilling permits to our customers. We are not able to predict the future impact of these events on our operations. Even with the drilling ban lifted, certain deepwater drilling activities remain suspended until the BOEMRE resumes its regular permitting of those activities. It has been reported that the industry currently has 36 floating rigs in the GOM that have been impacted by the moratorium and that five floating rigs have left the GOM since the imposition of the moratorium, two of which rigs were ours. As of the date of this report, we have two semisubmersible units under contract in the GOM, in addition to the Ocean Monarch, whose contract the operator has sought to terminate as discussed below, as well as two jack up units, one of which is under contract. Given the continuing uncertainty with respect to drilling activity in the GOM, our customers may seek to move additional rigs to locations outside of the GOM or perform activities which are allowed under the enhanced safety requirements. In June 2010, one of our customers asserted force majeure as a basis for its termination of the drilling contract for the Ocean Monarch, which had a remaining term of approximately 36 months. The operator has also filed suit against us in U.S. District Court in Houston seeking a declaratory judgment that its termination of the drilling contract is warranted under the contract. We do not believe the events cited by the operator come within the definition of force majeure under the drilling contract, and we do not believe that the operator has the right to terminate the drilling contract on this basis. Although we cannot predict with certainty the results of any such litigation, and there can be no assurance as to its ultimate outcome, we intend to vigorously defend this litigation and challenge the operators attempt to terminate the drilling contract. We are continuing to actively seek international opportunities to keep our rigs employed. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to employ our remaining impacted rigs in the GOM in the near term. In addition, given the ongoing uncertainty in the GOM with respect to drilling activity and other industry factors, we have cold stacked two intermediate floaters and four jack up rigs in the GOM. While dayrates we receive for new contracts are no longer at the peak levels achieved at the height of the most recent up cycle, improving oil prices, which had climbed to approximately $90 per barrel by the end of 2010, appear to be supporting demand for our equipment. As a result, dayrates for our international floater units appear to have stabilized, though demand for our services has not risen sufficiently to provide significant pricing power on new contracts. Additionally, the continuing regulatory uncertainty in the GOM could cause Diamond Offshore or others to move additional rigs out of the GOM to international locations. If we, or others, move a large number of additional rigs out of the GOM to international locations, the increased supply of available rigs entering the international market, coupled with un contracted new build rigs scheduled for delivery between now and the end of 2011, could create downward pressure on dayrates unless demand improves sufficiently to absorb the new supply. Since September 30, 2010 through the date of this report, we have entered into 17 new drilling contracts totaling approximately $457 million in backlog and ranging in duration from one well to one year. As of February 1, 2011, our contract backlog was approximately $6.6 billion, of which our contracts in the GOM (excluding amounts related 21 Table of Contents to the contract for the Ocean Monarch discussed above) represented approximately $141.0 million, or 2%, of our total contract backlog. Floaters Our intermediate and high specification floater rigs, both domestic and international, accounted for approximately 89% of our revenue during 2010. Approximately 74% of the time on our intermediate and high specification floater rigs is committed for 2011. Additionally, 51% of the time on our floating rigs is committed in 2012. International Jack ups During the fourth quarter of 2010, demand for our international jack ups remained weak but stable. However, the high specification new build equipment coming to market is enjoying a significantly higher utilization rate than older existing equipment, and the oversupply of jack up rigs could have an increasingly negative impact on the international sector throughout 2011 and beyond. U.S. Gulf of Mexico Jack ups The jack up market in the GOM has been negatively impacted by the slow issuance of jack up permits subsequent to the lifting of the drilling moratorium, as well as the impact of lower natural gas prices on both demand and dayrates. Our two remaining jack ups in the GOM are largely working under short term contracts and could experience significant downtime unless permitting activity increases. Absent an increase in permitting activity and a sustained improvement in natural gas prices, weakness in the GOM jack up market is likely to continue in 2011, with the possibility of additional rigs being cold stacked by us and others in the industry. Egyptian Operations We currently have one high specification floater and two jack up rigs contracted offshore Egypt with an aggregate net book value of $269.9 million, or approximately 6% of our total operating assets at December 31, 2010. Although these rigs have continued to work throughout the recent political unrest in Egypt, there have been, and in the future there may be other, disruptions to the support networks within Egypt, including the banking institutions. At February 1, 2011, our contract drilling backlog related to our drilling operations offshore Egypt was approximately $60.0 million, or 2% of our total contract drilling backlog, for 2011. Our customers may attempt to assert force majeure under the agreements under which these rigs are operating. As of the date of this report, we have not received any force majeure assertions with respect to our Egyptian operations. Contract Drilling Backlog The following table reflects our contract drilling backlog as of February 1, 2011, October 18, 2010 (the date reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010) and February 1, 2010 (the date reported in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2009). Contract drilling backlog is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period and adding one half of any potential rig performance bonuses. Our calculation also assumes full utilization of our drilling equipment for the contract period (excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days); however, the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors. Utilization rates, which generally approach 95 98% during contracted periods, can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including, but not limited to, weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance. Contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and customer reimbursables. No revenue is generally earned during periods of downtime for regulatory surveys. Changes in our contract drilling backlog between periods are a function of the performance of work on term contracts, as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts. 22 Table of Contents February 1, October 18, February 1, 2011 2010 (4) 2010 (4) (In thousands) Contract Drilling Backlog High Specification Floaters (1) $ 3,838,000 $ 4,371,000 $ 4,177,000 Intermediate Semisubmersibles (2) 2,700,000 3,009,000 4,030,000 Jack ups (3) 107,000 122,000 249,000 Total $ 6,645,000 $ 7,502,000 $ 8,456,000 (1) Contract drilling backlog as of February 1, 2011 for our high specification floaters includes (i) $3.0 billion attributable to our contracted operations offshore Brazil for the years 2011 to 2016 and (ii) $100.0 million attributable to our contracted operations in the GOM during 2011.

General The two most significant variables affecting our revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates, each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace. Demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development, as well as a variety of political, regulatory and economic factors. The availability of rigs in a particular geographical region also affects both dayrates and utilization rates. These factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict. Demand affects the number of days our fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned. As utilization rates increase, dayrates tend to increase as well, reflecting the lower supply of available rigs. Conversely, as utilization rates decrease, dayrates tend to decrease as well, reflecting the excess supply of rigs. When a rig is idle, no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result. Revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs, required surveys and shipyard upgrades. In order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates, we may mobilize our rigs from one market to another. However, during periods of mobilization, revenues may be adversely affected. As a response to changes in demand, we may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously, which may decrease or increase revenues, respectively. We recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed. In connection with such drilling contracts, we may receive fees (either lump sum or dayrate) for the mobilization of equipment. We earn these fees as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. We defer mobilization fees received, as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred, and amortize each, on a straight line basis, over the term of the related drilling contracts (which is the period we estimate to be benefited from the mobilization activity). Straight line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts (which generally range from two to 60 months) is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed. Absent a contract, mobilization costs are recognized currently. From time to time, we may receive fees from our customers for capital improvements to our rigs (either lump sum or dayrate). We defer such fees and recognize them into income on a straight line basis over the period of the related drilling contract as a component of contract drilling revenue. We capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of the improvement. We receive reimbursements for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services and other services provided at the request of our customers in accordance with a contract or agreement. We record these reimbursements at the gross amount billed to the customer as Revenues related to reimbursable expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in Item 8 of this report. Operating Income. Our operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors, but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses. Our operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling equipment. The principal components of our operating costs are, among other things, direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory inspections, boat and helicopter rentals and insurance. Labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most significant components of our operating expenses. In general, our labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels, rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which our rigs operate. Costs to repair and maintain our equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing, as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the regions in which our rigs are working. 24 Table of Contents Our operating costs are also impacted by the regulatory environments in which we operate. The adoption of new regulations could result in additional inspection and certification costs, as well as require additional capital investment to comply with regulatory requirements. Accordingly, we cannot fully predict the financial impact of new regulations that have been adopted subsequent to the Macondo incident in April 2010 for rigs operating in the GOM, or any new regulations that may arise as the investigation into the incident continues or as a result of further recommendations by regulatory agencies. New laws or regulations may require an increase in our capital spending for additional equipment to comply with such requirements. Our business could be negatively impacted by additional downtime which may be required to obtain necessary equipment and to install such equipment or to obtain the required inspections or certifications as prescribed under such regulations. Operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates, and short term reductions in utilization do not necessarily result in lower operating expenses. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or ready stacked state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract. However, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, we may reduce the size of a rigs crew and take steps to cold stack the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income. We recognize, as incurred, operating expenses related to activities such as inspections, painting projects and routine overhauls that meet certain criteria and which maintain rather than upgrade our rigs. These expenses vary from period to period. Costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements. Higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods following capital upgrades. Our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections, which we refer to as a 5 year survey, or special survey, that are due every five years for each of our rigs. Operating revenue decreases because these special surveys are performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard. Operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs. Repair and maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of rigs undergoing a 5 year survey will vary from year to year, as well as from quarter to quarter. In addition, operating income may be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim periods between 5 year surveys. Intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a 5 year survey. Although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the drilling rig, it normally does not require dry docking or shipyard time, except for rigs located in the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. During 2011, seven of our rigs will require 5 year surveys, and we expect that they will be out of service for approximately 455 days in the aggregate. We also expect to spend an additional approximately 290 days during 2011 for intermediate surveys, the mobilization of rigs, contract acceptance testing and extended maintenance projects. We can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and or duration of downtime associated with regulatory inspections, planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects. See Overview Contract Drilling Backlog. We are self insured for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. If a named windstorm in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico causes significant damage to our rigs or equipment, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Under our insurance policy that expires on May 1, 2011, we carry physical damage insurance for certain losses other than those caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for which our deductible for physical damage is $25.0 million per occurrence. We do not typically retain loss of hire insurance policies to cover our rigs. In addition, under our insurance policy that expires on May 1, 2011, we carry marine liability insurance covering certain legal liabilities, including coverage for certain personal injury claims, with no exclusions for pollution and or environmental risk. We believe that the policy limit for our marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of our size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for our business. Our deductibles for marine liability coverage, including for personal injury claims, are $10.0 million for the first occurrence and vary in amounts ranging between $5.0 million and, if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds, up to $100.0 million for each subsequent occurrence, depending on the nature, severity and frequency of claims which might arise during the policy year, which under the current policy commences on May 1 of each year. As a result of the Macondo 25 Table of Contents incident, insurance costs across the industry are expected to increase and in the future, certain insurance coverage is likely to become more costly, and may become less available or not available at all. Construction and Capital Upgrade Projects. We capitalize interest cost for the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP. The period of interest capitalization covers the duration of the activities required to make the asset ready for its intended use, and the capitalization period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we capitalized interest of $16.9 million on qualifying expenditures related to the upgrades of the Ocean Monarch for ultra deepwater service and the construction of two jack up rigs, the Ocean Shield and Ocean Scepter, through the date of each projects completion. We did not capitalize interest on any qualifying assets during 2010 or 2009. Critical Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 General Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Judgments, assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies. We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows: Property, Plant and Equipment. We carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost. Maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments, which meet certain criteria, are capitalized. Depreciation is amortized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives. Our management makes judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization, useful lives and salvage values. Changes in these judgments, assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported. We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable (such as cold stacking a rig or excess spending over budget on a new build or major rig upgrade). We utilize a probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. Our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis may include the following: dayrate by rig; utilization rate by rig (expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used); the per day operating cost for each rig if active, ready stacked or cold stacked; the estimated maintenance, inspection or other costs associated with a rig returning to work; salvage value for each rig; and estimated proceeds that may be received on disposition of the rig. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we develop a matrix by assigning probabilities to various combinations of assumed utilization rates and dayrates. We also consider the impact of a 5% reduction in assumed dayrates for the cold stacked rigs (holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant). As of December 31, 2010, we had cold stacked four jack up rigs consisting of three mat supported rigs and one independent leg, cantilevered rig (all in the GOM) and three intermediate semisubmersible drilling rigs (two in the GOM and one in Malaysia). We performed an impairment review for each of these rigs using the methodology described above. Based on our analyses, we have concluded that these seven rigs were not subject to impairment at December 31, 2010. Managements assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. 26 Table of Contents Personal Injury Claims. Our deductibles for liability coverage for personal injury claims, which primarily result from Jones Act liability in the Gulf of Mexico, are currently $10.0 million per the first occurrence, with no aggregate deductible, and vary in amounts ranging between $5.0 million and, if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds, up to $100.0 million for each subsequent occurrence, depending on the nature, severity and frequency of claims which might arise during the policy year. The Jones Act is a federal law that permits seamen to seek compensation for certain injuries during the course of their employment on a vessel and governs the liability of vessel operators and marine employers for the work related injury or death of an employee. We engage outside consultants to assist us in estimating our aggregate reserve for personal injury claims based on our historical losses and utilizing various actuarial models. The models used in estimating our aggregate reserve for personal injury claims include actuarial assumptions such as: claim emergence, or the delay between occurrence and recording of claims; settlement patterns, or the rates at which claims are closed; development patterns, or the rate at which known cases develop to their ultimate level; average, potential frequency and severity of claims; and effect of re opened claims. The eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from our estimated amounts due to uncertainties such as: the severity of personal injuries claimed; significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims; the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated; inconsistent court decisions; and the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards that require the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if necessary, which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach. We do not establish deferred tax liabilities for certain of our foreign earnings that we intend to indefinitely reinvest to finance foreign activities. However, if these earnings become subject to U.S. federal tax, any required provision could have a material impact on our financial results. We make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to the forecasting of our effective tax rate, the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits, and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit. Certain of our international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited, or DOIL, a Cayman Islands subsidiary which we wholly own. Since forming this subsidiary in 2002, it has been our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the subsidiary to finance foreign activities. Consequently, no U.S. federal income taxes are provided on these earnings except to the extent that such earnings were immediately subject to U.S. federal income taxes and except for the earnings of Diamond East Asia Limited, or DEAL, a wholly owned subsidiary of DOIL. It is our intention to repatriate the earnings of DEAL and, accordingly, U.S. income taxes are provided on its earnings. In several of the international locations in which we operate, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries enter into agreements with other of our wholly owned subsidiaries to provide specialized services and equipment in support of our foreign operations. We apply a transfer pricing methodology to determine the amount to be charged for providing the services and equipment, and utilize outside consultants to assist us in the development of such transfer pricing methodologies. In most cases, there are alternative transfer pricing methodologies that could be applied to these transactions and, if applied, could result in different chargeable amounts. We record interest related to accrued unrecognized tax positions in interest expense and recognize penalties associated with uncertain tax positions in our tax expense. 27 Table of Contents Results of Operations Although we perform contract drilling services with different types of drilling rigs and in many geographic locations, there is a similarity of economic characteristics among all our divisions and locations, including the nature of services provided and the type of customers for our services. We believe that the combination of our drilling rigs into one reportable segment is the appropriate aggregation in accordance with applicable accounting standards on segment reporting. However, for purposes of this discussion and analysis of our results of operations, we provide greater detail with respect to the types of rigs in our fleet and the geographic regions in which they operate to enhance the readers understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations.

Operating income in 2010 decreased $477.8 million, or 25%, compared to 2009. During 2010, our operating results were negatively impacted by a decline in average daily revenue earned by our rigs in 2010 from the levels attained in 2009. While our contracted revenue backlog enabled us to partially mitigate the impact of the weakened market conditions, our total contract drilling revenue decreased $306.8 million, or 9%, compared to 2009. Revenue generated by our domestic and international floater rigs decreased an aggregate $117.8 million, or 4%, and revenue for our combined jack up fleet decreased $189.2 million, or 41%, during 2010 compared to the previous year. During 2010, we cold stacked three additional rigs in the GOM, consisting of two intermediate floaters, which returned from Mexico during the year, and one jack up rig. However, the two newest additions to our floater fleet, the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor, began operating under contract during the first and fourth quarters of 2010, respectively, and contributed $109.3 million to our revenue during 2010. Total contract drilling expense increased $167.3 million, or 14%, in 2010 compared to 2009 and included normal operating costs for the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor, as well as increased amortized mobilization costs and higher other operating costs associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically. Other significant factors that affected the comparability of our operating income for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Bad Debt Expense. In December 2009, we recorded a $10.7 million provision for bad debts to reserve a portion of the uncollected balance of receivables related to our operations in Egypt and recovered $0.9 million related to a previously established reserve for bad debt recorded in 2008 related to our operations in the U.K. During 2010, we recovered $5.6 million and $4.2 million related to previously established reserves for bad debts related to our operations in Egypt and the U.K., respectively. Depreciation Expense. Depreciation expense increased $46.7 million, or 13%, during 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to depreciation associated with capital additions in 2009 and 2010, including depreciation of our two newest high specification floaters, the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor, which were placed in service in September 2009 and March 2010, respectively, but did not begin drilling operations until 2010. Gain on Disposition of Assets. Net gain on disposition of assets in 2010 was primarily related to the sale of the Ocean Shield on July 7, 2010. The rig was sold for net proceeds of $185.3 million and resulted in a net gain on sale of $32.8 million. Net gain on disposition of assets in 2009 included a $6.7 million gain on the sale of the Ocean Tower that was damaged during a hurricane in 2008. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $41.1 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a full year of interest expense in 2010 for our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2019, or 5.875% Senior Notes, and our 5.70% Senior Notes due 2039, or 5.70% Senior Notes, issued in May 2009 and October 2009, respectively ($31.9 million). In addition, during 2010, we recorded $4.8 million in interest expense related to uncertain tax positions compared to a $3.4 million net reduction of accrued interest expense related to an uncertain tax position for which the statute of limitations had expired during 2009. Foreign Currency Transaction Gain (Loss). Foreign currency transaction gain (loss) includes both realized and unrealized gains and losses from the settlement of and from mark to market accounting for our foreign currency forward exchange, or FOREX, contracts that we have not designated as accounting hedges. Such gains and losses fluctuate based on the level of transactions in foreign currencies, as well as fluctuations in such currencies. During 2009, we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of $11.5 million, including $8.9 million realized and unrealized gains on FOREX contracts ($37.3 million in net unrealized gains from mark to market accounting and $28.4 million in net realized losses on settled FOREX contracts not designated as accounting hedges). During 2010, we designated all of our FOREX contracts as accounting hedges. Income Tax Expense. Our income tax expense is a function of the mix between our domestic and international pre tax earnings or losses, respectively, as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognized $380.6 million of tax expense on pre tax income of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to tax expense of $492.2 million on pre tax income of $1.9 billion in 2009. The effective annual tax rate 29 Table of Contents of 28.5% in 2010 compared unfavorably to the effective annual tax rate of 26.3% in 2009 primarily because of higher taxes for income tax contingencies as well as taxes associated with the sale of the Ocean Shield. During 2010, we accrued approximately $35.7 million of expense for uncertain tax positions, primarily in Mexico and Brazil, of which $4.8 million is interest and $12.0 million is penalty related. On March 31, 2009, the statute of limitations relative to a 2003 uncertain tax position in Mexico expired. As a consequence, we reversed $5.5 million of previously accrued interest expense and $5.9 million of previously accrued tax expense, $0.8 million of which had been accrued for penalties. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Operating Income. Operating income in 2009 decreased $7.0 million, or less than 1%, compared to 2008. During 2009, our contracted revenue backlog allowed us to substantially mitigate the impact of the global economic recession on our business. Despite the downturn in the market, our contract drilling revenue increased $60.2 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The Ocean Monarch completed a major upgrade at the end of 2008 and began operating under contract in mid March 2009, generating revenue of $124.5 million. Our two new build jack up rigs, the Ocean Shield and Ocean Scepter, were completed in 2008 and contributed incremental revenue of $90.1 million during 2009 compared to 2008. However, our operating results for 2009 were negatively impacted by the ready stacking of the Ocean Star, Ocean Victory, Ocean Guardian and Ocean Scepter for extended periods and the cold stacking of our three mat supported GOM jack up rigs. The Ocean Bounty completed its contract offshore Australia in the third quarter of 2009 and was being prepared for cold stacking in Malaysia at the end of 2009. Total contract drilling expense increased $38.8 million, or 3%, in 2009 compared to 2008 and included normal operating costs for the upgraded Ocean Monarch and a full year of operating costs for our two new build jack ups. Other significant factors that affected the comparability of our operating income for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Bad Debt Expense. In December 2008, we recorded a $31.9 million provision for bad debts to reserve the uncollected balance of one of our customers in the U.K. that had entered into administration (a U.K. insolvency proceeding similar to U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy). We recovered $0.9 million associated with this reserve for bad debts during 2009. In December 2009, we recorded a $10.7 million provision for bad debts to reserve a portion of the uncollected balance of receivables related to our operations in Egypt. Depreciation Expense. Depreciation expense increased $59.0 million, or 21%, during 2009 compared to 2008 due to a higher depreciable asset base for 2009. Depreciation expense for 2009 included depreciation associated with our capital additions in 2008 and 2009, including the Ocean Shield, Ocean Scepter and Ocean Monarch, which were all placed in service at various times during 2008. Depreciation expense for 2009 also included depreciation of the Ocean Courage, which we acquired in June 2009 and placed in service in September 2009. Casualty Loss. In September 2008, one of our jack up rigs in the GOM sustained significant damage, including the loss of the rigs derrick, drill floor and related equipment. During 2008, we wrote off the approximately $2.6 million net book value of the lost equipment and accrued $3.7 million in estimated salvage costs for recovery of equipment from the ocean floor. Gain on Disposition of Assets. Net gain on disposition of assets in 2009 included a $6.7 million gain on the sale of the Ocean Tower compared to aggregate net gains of $2.8 million in 2008 on the sale and disposition of miscellaneous equipment. Interest Income. We earned interest income of $4.5 million in 2009 compared to $11.7 million in 2008. The $7.2 million decrease in interest income was primarily the result of lower average interest bearing cash balances during 2009 compared to 2008. Interest Expense. Interest expense in 2009 and 2008 related primarily to interest accrued on our outstanding indebtedness, net of capitalized interest, and our liabilities for uncertain tax positions. During 2009, we incurred incremental interest expense of $25.9 million related to our 5.875% Senior Notes and 5.70% Senior Notes, partially offset by a net $3.4 million reduction in accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions. During 2008, we 30 Table of Contents capitalized interest of $16.9 million related to qualifying construction projects and major upgrades that were all completed in 2008. We did not capitalize interest costs in 2009 as there were no qualifying activities during the year. Foreign Currency Transaction Gain (Loss). During 2009, we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of $11.5 million, which included $8.9 million in realized and unrealized gains on FOREX contracts ($37.3 million in net unrealized gains from mark to market accounting and $28.4 million in net realized losses on settled FOREX contracts) and net gains of $2.6 million on other foreign currency transactions. During 2008, we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of $65.6 million, which included $54.0 million in net losses on FOREX contracts ($37.2 million in net unrealized losses from mark to market accounting and $16.8 million in net realized losses on settled FOREX contracts) and other net foreign currency transaction losses of $11.6 million. Income Tax Expense. Our income tax expense is a function of the mix between our domestic and international pre tax earnings or losses, as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognized $492.2 million of tax expense on pre tax income of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to tax expense of $536.5 million on pre tax income of $1.8 billion in 2008. The effective annual tax rate of 26.3% in 2009 compared favorably to the effective annual tax rate of 29.1% in 2008 primarily because of higher earnings of DOIL in 2009 which were taxed at lower rates. Our income tax returns are subject to review and examination in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and we are currently contesting various tax assessments. We accrue for income tax contingencies, or uncertain tax positions, that we believe are more likely than not exposures. We recognized expense of $3.3 million and $3.4 million for uncertain tax positions in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2009 we recorded a net reduction to interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $3.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized $0.8 million of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions. Penalty related tax expense for uncertain tax positions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $4.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. On March 31, 2009, the statute of limitations relative to a 2003 uncertain tax position in Mexico expired. As a consequence, we reversed $5.5 million of previously accrued interest expense and $5.9 million of previously accrued tax expense, $0.8 million of which had been accrued for penalties. In December 2009 we received an approximately $26 million assessment from the Brazilian tax authorities for the years 2004 and 2005. We contested the tax assessment in January 2010 and are awaiting the outcome of the appeal. As required by GAAP, only the portion of the tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement is to be recognized. During 2009 we accrued approximately $7 million of expense attributable to the portion of the tax assessment we determined to be an uncertain tax position in our 2009 Consolidated Statements of Operations, of which approximately $2 million was interest related and approximately $2 million was penalty related. 31 Table of Contents High Specification Floaters.

Revenue generated by our high specification floaters operating in the GOM decreased $545.4 million during 2010 compared to 2009, as a result of 1,299 fewer revenue earning days ($544.9 million) and a decrease in average daily revenue earned during 2010 ($31.8 million), partially offset by a $30.7 million contract termination fee from a previous customer of the Ocean Endeavor. The decrease in revenue earning days in 2010 is primarily due to the relocation of several of our high specification rigs to international markets since early 2009 and unplanned downtime due to a force majeure assertion by one of our customers in the GOM. Contract drilling expense for our high specification floaters in the GOM decreased by $124.7 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a $129.5 million reduction attributable to the rigs relocated to other regions, including $4.3 million of start up costs for the Ocean Courage incurred in 2009 prior to a change in contract that redirected the rig to Brazil in early 2010. Australia/Asia/Middle East. During 2010, revenue from our high specification rigs operating in the Australia/Asia/Middle East region increased $71.6 million compared to 2009, primarily due to 158 additional revenue earning days in 2010. The increase in revenue earning days in 2010 is primarily the result of the relocation of the Ocean America to Australia. Contract drilling expense for our operations in this region increased $31.9 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating, contract preparation and amortized mobilization costs for the Ocean America ($30.7 million). Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. Revenue generated by our high specification floaters operating in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean region increased $204.4 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to 392 incremental revenue earning days in 2010 ($223.7 million) and the recognition of $21.7 million in amortized mobilization fees, partially offset by a decrease in average daily revenue earned ($41.0 million). The increase in revenue earning days in 2010 is the result of the relocation of two additional rigs to this region in 2010 and a full year of operation for the Ocean Valiant. Contract drilling expense for our operations during 2010 increased $66.3 million compared to 2009 due to the inclusion of normal operating and amortized mobilization costs for the two rigs relocated to the region in 2010 and a full year of operating costs for the Ocean Valiant. South America. Revenue earned by our high specification floaters operating offshore Brazil increased $303.2 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to 712 additional revenue earning days ($169.3 million) combined with an increase in average daily revenue earned by our rigs in this region ($118.4 million) during 2010 and the recognition of $15.5 million in amortized mobilization revenue. The increase in revenue earning days is primarily due to the additional rigs operating in the region during 2010 compared to 2009. Contract drilling expense for our 33 Table of Contents operations in Brazil increased $195.7 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the inclusion of normal operating costs for the additional rigs operating in the region during 2010, including a full year of contract drilling expense for the Ocean Quest ($123.8 million) and higher contract drilling expense for the remainder of our South American rigs that operated in both 2010 and 2009 ($71.9 million). The increase in costs for our static fleet in 2010 compared to 2009 reflects higher labor and personnel related costs, incremental shipyard and repair costs for the Ocean Alliance as a result of a 145 day shipyard period for an intermediate inspection and thruster change out, higher amortized mobilization costs and an increase in revenue based fees. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 GOM. Revenue generated by our high specification floaters operating in the GOM decreased $108.2 million during 2009 compared to 2008, as a result of 419 fewer revenue earning days ($165.4 million), partially offset by the effect of an increase in average daily revenue earned during 2009 ($57.3 million). The decrease in revenue earning days in 2009, compared to 2008, was attributable to downtime associated with contract preparation activities for the Ocean Quest and Ocean Valiant, scheduled surveys days for the Ocean America and 191 ready stack days for the Ocean Star, partially offset by incremental revenue earning days for the Ocean Monarch after completion of its major upgrade. Contract drilling expense for our high specification floaters in the GOM increased by $26.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008 and included an aggregate of $32.0 million in incremental start up and operating costs for the Ocean Monarch and start up costs for the Ocean Courage (prior to a change in contract that subsequently relocated the rig to Brazil). Contract drilling expense for 2009 also reflected higher labor and related costs ($5.7 million), higher survey, repair and mobilization costs ($19.6 million), including incremental costs associated with a special survey for the Ocean America, and higher overhead costs ($5.8 million) compared to the prior year. These cost increases were partially offset by a $35.5 million reduction in contract drilling expense attributable to the two rigs that we relocated out of the GOM during 2009. Australia/Asia/Middle East. During 2009, our high specification rig operating offshore Malaysia, the Ocean Rover, generated $84.3 million in additional revenue compared to 2008, primarily due to an increase in average daily revenue earned in 2009 ($69.7 million) and an increase in utilization during 2009 ($14.7 million). Utilization increased in 2009 compared to 2008, when the rig had 67 days of scheduled downtime for a special survey and related repairs. Contract drilling expense for the Ocean Rover decreased slightly compared to 2008 as lower survey and mobilization costs ($5.2 million) were partially offset by higher revenue based agency fees ($2.7 million). Contract drilling expense for 2009 also included $1.2 million in repair costs for the Ocean Valor while in a shipyard in Singapore. Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. The Ocean Valiant began operating offshore Angola in the third quarter of 2009 and generated revenue and incurred contract drilling expense of $66.2 million and $14.0 million, respectively. South America. Revenue earned by our high specification floaters operating offshore Brazil in 2009 increased $16.3 million compared to 2008, primarily due to 298 additional revenue earning days in 2009 ($101.1 million), partially offset by a decline in average daily revenue earned by our rigs in the region during 2009 ($90.8 million). The increase in revenue earning days is the result of the operation of the Ocean Quest offshore Brazil beginning in the first quarter of 2009, as well as increased utilization of the Ocean Clipper, which experienced significant downtime during 2008 for a survey and unplanned repairs to its propulsion system. We also recognized $6.0 million in amortized mobilization revenue associated with the relocation of the Ocean Quest from the GOM during 2009. Contract drilling expense for our operations in Brazil increased $0.5 million in 2009 compared to 2008 as the impact of the addition of incremental normal operating costs for the Ocean Quest ($23.1 million) was partially offset by a reduction in costs primarily attributable to the 2008 survey of the Ocean Clipper and repairs to its propulsion system ($15.6 million) and reduced labor and related costs ($5.1 million). 34 Table of Contents Intermediate Semisubmersibles.

Revenue generated by our intermediate semisubmersible fleet located in the GOM in 2010 decreased $43.6 million compared to 2009 due to a reduction in average daily revenue earned ($22.3 million) and 85 fewer revenue earning days ($21.3 million) in 2010. The decrease in dayrates and utilization was primarily related to the depressed GOM market, which was a contributing factor in our decision to cold stack two of our intermediate semisubmersible rigs in this market during the third quarter of 2010. Contract drilling expense for our intermediate floater fleet in the GOM increased $3.6 million in 2010 compared to 2009, as incremental contract drilling, mobilization and cold stacking costs for the Ocean Voyager and Ocean New Era ($16.0 million) were partially offset by reduced contract drilling expense for the Ocean Ambassador ($13.1 million). We currently have one working and two cold stacked intermediate semisubmersible rigs in the GOM. Mexico. Revenue generated by our intermediate semisubmersibles operating offshore Mexico decreased $169.9 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to 512 fewer revenue earning days ($151.3 million) combined with a decrease in average daily revenue earned ($20.9 million). Contract drilling expense decreased $26.8 million during 2010 compared to 2009. The decline in revenue and contract drilling expense in 2010 was primarily due to the relocation of both of our Mexico intermediate semisubmersible rigs to the GOM after completion of their contracts. We currently have no intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating offshore Mexico. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Revenue generated by our intermediate semisubmersibles operating in the Australia/Asia/Middle East region decreased $79.7 million in 2010 compared to 2009, as a result of 224 fewer revenue earning days ($74.7 million) combined with a decrease in average daily revenue earned ($5.0 million) during 2010. Contract drilling expense for the Australia/Asia/Middle East region decreased $15.9 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease in revenue and contract drilling expense in this region in 2010 was primarily due to cold stacking the Ocean Bounty after completion of its contract in 2009. Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. Operating revenue for our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean region decreased $201.9 million in 2010, primarily due to a 522 day reduction in revenue earning days ($177.3 million) and a reduction in average daily revenue earned ($21.1 million) in 2010 compared to 2009. Revenue earning days decreased in 2010 due to the relocation of two rigs to the South American region and approximately 100 days of planned downtime for a special survey of our rig in Norway. Contract drilling expense in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean region decreased $30.1 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the two rigs moved to the South American region ($50.3 million), partially offset by incremental costs associated with the regulatory survey of the Ocean Vanguard. South America. Revenue generated by our intermediate semisubmersibles operating in the South American region increased $343.4 million in 2010 compared to 2009. Both revenue earning days and average daily revenue 36 Table of Contents earned increased in 2010 compared to 2009, and contributed incremental revenue of $189.1 million and $132.3 million, respectively. The increase in revenue is partially attributable to a full year of operations for the Ocean Ambassador and Ocean Lexington in 2010, compared to only a partial year of operations in 2009 after their relocation to the region, combined with higher dayrates earned in 2010, compared to 2009. We also recognized $22.0 million in incremental amortized mobilization revenue in 2010 compared to the prior year. Contract drilling expense in the region increased $116.8 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the increase in the number of rigs operating in the region ($87.7 million) and higher contract drilling expense for our rigs operating offshore Brazil during both years, primarily for labor and personnel related expenditures, revenue based fees and incremental costs associated with a special survey for the Ocean Winner. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 GOM. Revenue generated by our intermediate semisubmersible fleet operating in the GOM in 2009 decreased $2.7 million compared to 2008, primarily due to lower average daily revenue earned in 2009. The effect of reduced average daily revenue was partially offset by an increase in revenue earning days, primarily as a result of the 2008 relocation of the Ocean Ambassador. Contract drilling expense for our intermediate floater fleet in the GOM decreased $12.7 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to a reduction in costs as a result of rigs transferred out of the GOM ($14.2 million), partially offset by higher overhead costs ($1.0 million) and labor and related costs ($0.9 million) for our remaining intermediate semisubmersible fleet in the GOM. Mexico. Revenue generated by our intermediate semisubmersibles operating offshore Mexico decreased $3.1 million and reflected a 57 day decrease in revenue earning days ($15.8 million), partially offset by an increase in average daily revenue earned in 2009 compared to 2008 ($12.7 million). Contract drilling expense decreased $7.4 million during 2009 compared to 2008. The decline in revenue and contract drilling expense in 2009 was primarily due to the relocation of the Ocean Ambassador out of the region. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Operating revenue for our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the Australia/Asia/Middle East region increased $28.0 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to an increase in average daily revenue earned during 2009 ($34.4 million), partially offset by a $4.5 million reduction in amortized mobilization revenue associated with the Ocean Patriots relocation within the region (New Zealand to Australia) in 2008. In 2009, we elected to cold stack the Ocean Bounty after completion of its contract offshore Australia in July and were in the process of finding a suitable location at the end of 2009. Contract drilling expense for the Australia/Asia/Middle East region decreased $21.5 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to reduced costs for the Ocean Bounty ($11.4 million), lower survey, repair and mobilization costs ($7.2 million), as a result of the completion of special surveys of the Ocean Patriot and Ocean General in 2008, and lower shorebase support costs ($1.9 million) associated with a Melbourne shorebase office that was closed in 2008. Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. Operating revenue for our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean region decreased $36.4 million in 2009 compared to 2008. Revenue earning days decreased by 232 days in 2009 ($72.3 million) compared to 2008, while average daily revenue increased in 2009 ($39.0 million). The decrease in revenue earning days in 2009 was the result of the early termination of a drilling contract for the Ocean Nomad and intermittent work for the Ocean Guardian, partially offset by reduced downtime for the Ocean Princess, which completed its 2008 special survey in early 2009. Contract drilling expense in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean region decreased $30.2 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to lower labor and personnel related costs for our rigs operating in the North Sea ($4.6 million), including the reversal of a previously recorded reserve for paid time off for our U.K. national employees, and reduced costs associated with regulatory surveys ($13.5 million), including repairs. Contract drilling expense in this region also decreased as a result of the relocation of two rigs to Brazil in the second half of 2009 ($10.1 million). South America. Revenue generated by our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the South American region increased $83.5 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to 381 incremental revenue earning days in 2009 ($81.8 million). In addition, 2009 revenue was favorably impacted by a slight increase in average daily revenue earned compared to 2008 ($4.4 million). Contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersibles increased $48.3 million in 2009, compared to 2008, primarily due to an increase in the number of rigs operating in the region ($15.8 million). Contract drilling expense for 2009 also reflected higher overall operating and support costs, including revenue based agency fees and non income taxes ($11.2 million), labor and related costs ($7.0 million), maintenance and other costs associated with customer acceptance testing and inspections ($6.7 million) and shorebase support and overhead costs ($6.2 million). 37 Table of Contents Jack Ups.

Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the GOM decreased $7.2 million during 2010 compared to 2009 due to a decrease in average daily revenue earned during 2010 ($18.7 million), partially offset by the effect of 138 incremental revenue earning days during 2010 ($10.8 million). Due to continued unfavorable market conditions in the GOM, we elected to cold stack an additional jack up rig in the third quarter of 2010, leaving us with four cold stacked jack up rigs in the GOM at December 31, 2010. Contract drilling expense for our jack ups in the GOM decreased $7.9 million during 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to cold stacking of four of our jack up rigs ($26.3 million) and the absence of costs associated with a special survey in 2009. However, the reduction in contract drilling expense in 2010 was partially offset by incremental costs resulting from the net increase of one rig in the GOM in 2010 compared to the prior year. Mexico. Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating offshore Mexico decreased $16.8 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to 100 fewer revenue earning days ($13.5 million) and a decrease in average daily revenue earned ($3.1 million). Contract drilling expense increased $2.4 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher overhead, shorebase support and amortized mobilization costs. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the Australia/Asia/Middle East region decreased $68.2 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a reduction in average daily revenue ($45.5 million) and 72 fewer revenue earning days ($14.9 million) in 2010. In addition, revenue in 2009 included $7.8 million in amortized mobilization revenue related to the Ocean Shields move to Australia. Revenue earning days during 2010 decreased due to the sale of the Ocean Shield in July 2010. Contract drilling expense decreased $13.9 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a reduction in costs for the Ocean Shield ($10.9 million) and costs associated with the Ocean Sovereigns 2009 survey and shipyard project. 39 Table of Contents Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean region decreased $42.5 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a decrease in average daily revenue earned ($30.3 million) and a decrease of 115 revenue earning days ($11.0 million) during 2010. Contract drilling expense decreased $0.3 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to fewer operating days for the Ocean King, which completed its bareboat charter offshore Croatia in July 2010, partially offset by an increase in costs associated with a survey and related repairs for the Ocean Spur that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2010. South America. Revenue and contract drilling expense decreased $54.5 million and $26.1 million, respectively, in 2010 compared to 2009. Our only jack up rig in this region, the Ocean Scepter, operated offshore Argentina until July 2009 and was subsequently relocated to the GOM. We moved this rig back to the region in August 2010 for a contract offshore Brazil, where it incurred $10.2 million in expense related to customer acceptance activities during 2010. The rig is expected to begin drilling under contract in the first quarter of 2011. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 GOM. Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the GOM decreased $126.5 million during 2009 compared to 2008 due to 1,539 fewer revenue earning days in 2009 ($124.3 million) compounded by the effect of a lower average daily revenue earned in 2009 ($2.1 million). The decline in revenue earning days was reflective of the depressed GOM market, and as a result of such market factors, in 2009 we elected to cold stack our three mat supported jack ups in this region. In addition, the Ocean Tower, which received extensive damage during a 2008 hurricane, was removed from service in October 2008 and subsequently sold in 2009. Contract drilling expense for our jack ups operating in the GOM decreased $27.1 million during 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to significantly reduced operating costs for the Ocean Tower and our three cold stacked rigs ($24.1 million) and a reduction in labor and related costs for our actively marketed jack up fleet in the GOM ($4.9 million). The decrease in costs in 2009 was partially offset by 2009 survey and repair costs for two rigs and demobilization costs for the Ocean Columbia, which relocated to the GOM for a shipyard project ($1.9 million). Mexico. Revenue and contract drilling expense generated by our jack up rigs operating offshore Mexico increased $0.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively, in 2009 compared to the prior year. The effect on revenue of an increase in revenue earning days in 2009 was mostly offset by a decrease in average daily revenue earned during the 2009 period. Contract drilling expense increased primarily due to costs associated with contract preparation activities, customer acceptance and the inclusion of normal operating costs of the Ocean Summit, partially offset by lower operating costs for the Ocean Columbia due to its relocation to the GOM. Australia/Asia/Middle East. Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the Australia/Asia/Middle East region increased $48.2 million in 2009 compared to 2008 and included $57.3 million of incremental revenues earned by the Ocean Shield. However, total revenue earning days decreased in 2009 as incremental operating days for the Ocean Shield were more than offset by an increase in unpaid shipyard days for the Ocean Sovereign and due to the relocation of the Ocean Heritage to another region. Contract drilling expense increased $7.9 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to costs associated with the Ocean Sovereigns 2009 survey and shipyard project and a net increase in normal operating costs in the region ($3.1 million). Contract drilling expense in 2009 also included $11.5 million in incremental operating costs, including amortized mobilization costs, for the Ocean Shield. Operating costs in 2009 were partially offset by reduced costs for the Ocean Heritage ($6.6 million). Europe/Africa/Mediterranean. Revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the Europe/Africa/Mediterranean region decreased $22.6 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to a decrease in average daily revenue earned in 2009 ($31.5 million), partially offset by the impact of an increase in revenue earning days during the same period ($15.4 million). In addition, during 2008, we recognized a $6.5 million lump sum demobilization fee for the Ocean Spur upon completion of its initial contract offshore Egypt. Contract drilling expense increased $3.8 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of operating costs in 2009 for the Ocean Heritage ($4.4 million). South America. Our newly constructed jack up rig, the Ocean Scepter, began operating offshore Argentina late in the third quarter of 2008. The Ocean Scepter completed its contract in July 2009. 40 Table of Contents Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from our operations and our cash reserves. We may also make use of our $285 million credit facility for cash liquidity. See $285 Million Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2010, we had $464.4 million in Cash and cash equivalents and $612.3 million in Investments and marketable securities, representing our investment of cash available for current operations. Cash Flows from Operations. Our cash flows from operations are impacted by the ability of our customers to weather the instability in the U.S. and global economies and restrictions in the credit market, as well as the volatility in energy prices. In general, before working for a customer with whom we have not had a prior business relationship and or whose financial stability may appear uncertain to us, we perform a credit review on that company. Based on that analysis, we may require that the customer present a letter of credit, prepay or provide other credit enhancements. If a potential customer is unable to obtain an adequate level of credit, it may preclude us from doing business with that potential customer. These external factors which affect our cash flows from operations, many which are not within our control, are difficult to predict. For a description of other factors that could affect our cash flows from operations, see Overview Industry Conditions, Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. During 2009, we amended an existing contractual agreement at a customers request to provide short term financial relief. The amended contract obligates the customer to pay us, over the term of the six well drilling program, an aggregate drilling rate of $560,000 per day, consisting of $75,000 per day payable in accordance with our normal credit terms (due 30 days after receipt of invoice) and the remainder of the contractual dayrate, $485,000 per day, payable through the conveyance of a 27% net profits interest, or NPI, in certain developmental oil and gas producing properties. As of December 31, 2010, we had drilled four wells for this customer and were owed $85.0 million payable through the NPI. We began receiving monthly payments from the conveyance of the NPI in July 2010 and through the date of this report have received an aggregate of $13.7 million through the NPI. Based on current production payout estimates, we expect to collect $49.6 million of the receivable within the next twelve months and the remaining $35.4 million of the receivable within the following twelve months. However, payment of such amounts, and the timing of such payments, are contingent upon such production and upon energy sale prices. $285 Million Revolving Credit Facility. We maintain a $285 million syndicated, senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility, for general corporate purposes, including loans and performance or standby letters of credit, that will mature on November 2, 2011. Loans under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, either (i) the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin, varying from 0.20% to 0.525%, based on our current credit ratings. Under our Credit Facility, we also pay, based on our current credit ratings, and as applicable, other customary fees, including, but not limited to, a facility fee on the total commitment under the Credit Facility regardless of usage and a utilization fee that applies if the aggregate of all loans outstanding under the Credit Facility equals or exceeds 50% of the total commitment under the facility. Changes in credit ratings could lower or raise the fees that we pay under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, the maintenance of a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization, as defined in the Credit Facility, of not more than 60% at the end of each fiscal quarter and limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations, liquidation and dissolution, changes in lines of business, swap agreements, transactions with affiliates and subsidiary indebtedness. Based on our current credit ratings at December 31, 2010, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans would have been 0.24%. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements Credit Ratings. As of December 31, 2010, there were no loans outstanding under the Credit Facility; however $21.9 million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the Credit Facility. 41 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Requirements Our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements. We determine the amount of cash required to meet our capital commitments by evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements, our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, and our obligations relating to the construction of our new drillships. We believe that our operating cash flows and cash reserves will be sufficient to meet both our working capital requirements and our capital commitments over the next twelve months; however, we will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions and will adjust capital spending programs if required. In addition, we may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. Our ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity securities will be dependent on our results of operations, our current financial condition, current market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Additionally, we may also make use of our Credit Facility to finance capital expenditures or for other general corporate purposes. Contractual Cash Obligations. The following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2010. Contractual Obligations Payments Due By Period Less than After 5 Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years years (In thousands) Long term debt (principal and interest) (1) $ 2,688,625 $ 82,938 $ 165,876 $ 652,998 $ 1,786,813 Construction contracts (2) 514,757 154,427 360,330 Operating leases 3,300 1,900 1,400 Total obligations $ 3,206,682 $ 239,265 $ 527,606 $ 652,998 $ 1,786,813 (1) See Note 9 Long Term Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. (2) In December 2010, we entered into a turnkey contract with Hyundai for the construction of a dynamically positioned, ultra deepwater drillship with delivery scheduled for late in the second quarter of 2013. See Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Obligations to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The above table excludes FOREX contracts in the aggregate notional amount of $140.3 million outstanding at December 31, 2010. See further information regarding these contracts in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Exchange Risk and Note 6 Derivative Financial Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. As of December 31, 2010, the total unrecognized tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions was $45.9 million. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with the liabilities recognized in this balance, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. We had no other purchase obligations for major rig upgrades or any other significant obligations at December 31, 2010, except for those related to our direct rig operations, which arise during the normal course of business. However, in January 2011, we entered into a turnkey contract with Hyundai for the construction of a second dynamically positioned, ultra deepwater drillship with delivery scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2013. See Note 18 Subsequent Event to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 42 Table of Contents Other Commercial Commitments Letters of Credit. We were contingently liable as of December 31, 2010 in the amount of $101.6 million under certain performance, bid, supersedeas and custom bonds and letters of credit, including $21.9 million in letters of credit issued under our Credit Facility. Three of these bonds totaling $47.7 million were purchased from a related party after obtaining competitive quotes. Agreements relating to approximately $47.7 million of performance bonds can require collateral at any time. As of December 31, 2010 we had not been required to make any collateral deposits with respect to these agreements. The remaining agreements cannot require collateral except in events of default. Banks have issued letters of credit on our behalf securing certain of these bonds. See Note 12 Related Party Transactions to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. The table below provides a list of these obligations in U.S. dollar equivalents and their time to expiration. For the Years Ending December 31, Total 2011 2012 Thereafter (In thousands) Other Commercial Commitments Customs bonds $ 5,559 $ 5,559 $ $ Performance bonds 68,159 50,866 17,293 Other 27,869 27,869 Total obligations $ 101,587 $ 84,294 $ 17,293 $ Credit Ratings. Our current credit rating is Baa1 for Moodys Investors Services and A for Standard Poors. Although our long term ratings continue at investment grade levels, lower ratings would result in higher rates for borrowings under our Credit Facility and could also result in higher interest rates on future debt issuances. Capital Expenditures. During 2010, we spent approximately $434 million on capital expenditures, including approximately $80 million towards the commissioning and outfitting for service of the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor and approximately $354 million relating to our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, equipment required for our long term international contracts and other corporate requirements. We have budgeted approximately $320 million on capital expenditures for 2011 associated with our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs and other corporate requirements. In addition, as of the date of this report, we have spent approximately $310 million in 2011 towards the construction of two new, ultra deepwater drillships with delivery scheduled for late in the second and fourth quarters of 2013. We expect to finance our 2011 capital expenditures through the use of our existing cash balances or internally generated funds. From time to time, however, we may also make use of our Credit Facility to finance capital expenditures. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no off balance sheet debt or other arrangements. 43 Table of Contents Historical Cash Flows The following is a discussion of our historical cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Change (In thousands) Net income $ 955,457 $ 1,376,219 $ (420,762 ) Net changes in operating assets and liabilities (3,119 ) (286,069 ) 282,950 Proceeds from settlement of FOREX contracts designated as accounting hedges 3,307 8,895 (5,588 ) (Gain) on sale and disposition of assets (34,714 ) (7,902 ) (26,812 ) (Gain) loss on sale of marketable securities 7 (619 ) 626 (Gain) on FOREX contracts (3,307 ) (17,751 ) 14,444 Deferred tax provision (6,916 ) 85,524 (92,440 ) Depreciation and other non cash items, net 371,603 358,517 13,086 $ 1,282,318 $ 1,516,814 $ (234,496 ) Our cash flows from operations in 2010 decreased $234.5 million compared to 2009. This decrease is primarily due to lower earnings resulting from an aggregate reduction in average utilization of and dayrates earned by our drilling fleet, increased mobilization costs, and the effect of lower deferred mobilization fees. The decrease in operating cash flows for the 2010 period was partially offset by a decrease in net cash required to satisfy working capital requirements in 2010 compared to 2009. We used $283.0 million less cash to satisfy working capital needs during 2010 primarily due to a decrease in our outstanding accounts receivable balances and an increase in accounts payable at December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year. Trade and other receivables generated cash of $143.1 million in 2010 compared to using cash of $219.9 million in 2009 and accounts payable and accrued liabilities generated cash of $33.3 million in 2010 compared to using cash of $26.7 million in 2009. During 2010, we made U.S. federal income tax payments of $427.5 million compared to $252.4 million in 2009. We paid foreign income taxes, net of refunds, of $128.5 million and $176.2 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Change (In thousands) Purchase of marketable securities $ (5,660,518 ) $ (4,473,575 ) $ (1,186,943 ) Proceeds from sale of marketable securities 5,450,230 4,473,891 976,339 Capital expenditures (including rig acquisitions) (434,262 ) (1,362,468 ) 928,206 Proceeds from disposition of assets 188,066 40,462 147,604 Cost to settle FOREX contracts not designated as accounting hedges (28,445 ) 28,445 $ (456,484 ) $ (1,350,135 ) $ 893,651 Our investing activities used $456.5 million in 2010 compared to $1.4 billion in 2009. During 2010, we purchased marketable securities, net of sales, of $210.3 million compared to net sales of $0.3 million during 2009. Our level of investment activity is dependent on our working capital and other capital requirements during the year, as well as a response to actual or anticipated events or conditions in the securities markets. During 2010, we spent $434.3 million related to ongoing capital maintenance programs, including rig modifications to meet contractual requirements and final commissioning and initial outfitting costs of the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor, compared to $1.4 billion in 2009. Capital expenditures in 2009 included $1.0 billion for the purchase of two newbuild, dynamically positioned, semisubmersible drilling rigs, the Ocean Valor and Ocean Courage. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures. 44 Table of Contents On July 7, 2010, we completed the sale of the Ocean Shield for net proceeds of $185.3 million. During 2009, we completed the sale of the Ocean Tower and received net proceeds of $35.4 million. Prior to May 2009, we entered into FOREX contracts as economic hedges of our foreign currency requirements; however, we did not designate these contracts as accounting hedges. During the latter part of 2008 and during 2009, the strengthening U.S. dollar (or, conversely, the weakening foreign currency) negatively impacted these expiring FOREX contracts and resulted in our having to pay a net $28.5 million on settlement of these contracts during 2009. During 2010, all of our FOREX contracts were designated as accounting hedges, the settlement of which was recognized as a component of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Change (In thousands) Redemption of zero coupon debentures $ (4,238 ) $ $ (4,238 ) Issuance of senior notes 995,975 (995,975 ) Payment of dividends (733,661 ) (1,115,211 ) 381,550 Other 41 (7,078 ) 7,119 $ (737,858 ) $ (126,314 ) $ (611,544 ) On May 28, 2010, we redeemed the then outstanding $4.2 million accreted value, or $6.0 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity, of our Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures due 2020, or Zero Coupon Debentures, at a redemption price of $706.28 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity for cash. In 2009, we issued two tranches of senior, unsecured debt aggregating $1.0 billion for general corporate purposes and paid $8.7 million in fees related to these issuances. During 2010, we paid cash dividends totaling $733.7 million, consisting of aggregate regular cash dividends totaling $69.5 million, or $0.125 per share of our common stock per quarter, and aggregate special cash dividends totaling $664.2 million, or $1.875 and $1.375 per share of our common stock in the first and second quarters of 2010, respectively, and $0.75 per share of our common stock in each of the last two quarters of 2010. During 2009, we paid cash dividends totaling $1.1 billion, which consisted of aggregate regular cash dividends of $69.5 million, or $0.125 per share of our common stock per quarter, and aggregate special cash dividends of $1.0 billion, or $1.875 per share of our common stock per quarter. On February 2, 2011, we declared a regular cash dividend and a special cash dividend of $0.125 and $0.75, respectively, per share of our common stock. Both the quarterly and special cash dividends are payable on February 28, 2011 to stockholders of record on February 11, 2011. Our Board of Directors has adopted a policy to consider paying special cash dividends, in amounts to be determined, on a quarterly basis. Our Board of Directors may, in subsequent quarters, consider paying additional special cash dividends, in amounts to be determined, if it believes that our financial position, earnings, earnings outlook, capital spending plans and other relevant factors warrant such action at that time. Depending on market conditions, we may, from time to time, purchase shares of our common stock in the open market or otherwise. We did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Other Currency Risk. Some of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their operations in the local currency of the country where they conduct operations. Currency environments in which we have significant business operations include Brazil, the U.K., Australia, Angola and Mexico. When possible, we attempt to minimize our currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to our estimated operating costs payable in local currency with the balance of the contract payable in U.S. dollars. At present, however, only a limited number of our contracts are payable both in U.S. dollars and the local currency. 45 Table of Contents To the extent that we are not able to cover our local currency operating costs with customer payments in the local currency, we also utilize FOREX contracts to reduce our currency exchange risk. Our FOREX contracts may obligate us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specific dates or to net settle the spread between the contracted foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date, which, for most of our contracts, is the average spot rate for the contract period. We record currency transaction gains and losses as Foreign currency transaction gain (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses arising from the settlement of our FOREX contracts that have been designated as cash flow hedges are reported as a component of Contract drilling expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The information included in this Item 7A is considered to constitute forward looking statements for purposes of the statutory safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements in Item 7 of this report. Our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments. Market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at December 31, 2010 and 2009, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. We believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur. Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by our senior management. Senior management approves the overall investment strategy that we employ and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to us. We may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. Our investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities. We monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates. The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity. The analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period. The sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on December 31, 2010 and 2009, due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly, the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our earnings or stockholders equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Loans under our $285 million syndicated, senior unsecured revolving Credit Facility bear interest at our option at a rate per annum equal to (i) the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (ii) LIBOR plus an applicable margin, varying from 0.20% to 0.525%, based on our current credit ratings. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no loans outstanding under the Credit Facility (however, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, $21.9 million and $63.3 million, respectively, in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the Credit Facility). Our long term debt, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates, and as such, interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of $117.0 million and $121.3 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. A 100 basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of $135.5 million and $136.2 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 49 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. It is customary for us to enter into FOREX contracts in the normal course of business. These contracts generally require us to net settle the spread between the contracted foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date, which for certain contracts is the average spot rate for the contract period. As of December 31, 2010, we had FOREX contracts outstanding in the aggregate notional amount of $140.3 million, consisting of $35.1 million in Australian dollars, $81.2 million in Brazilian reais, $9.2 million in British pounds sterling, $3.0 million in Mexican pesos and $11.8 million in Norwegian kroner. These contracts generally settle monthly through July 2011. At December 31, 2010, we have presented the fair value of our outstanding FOREX contracts as a current asset of $4.3 million in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and a current liability of $(0.1) million in Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report. We have presented the fair value of our outstanding FOREX contracts at December 31, 2009 as a current asset of $2.6 million in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and a current liability of $(0.2) million in Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report. The following table presents our exposure to market risk by category (interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates): Fair Value Asset (Liability) Market Risk December 31, December 31, 2010 2009 2010 2009 (In thousands) Interest rate: Marketable securities $ 612,300 (a) $ 400,900 (a) $ (1,100 ) (c) $ (300 ) (c) Long term debt 1,585,100 (b) 1,546,900 (b) Foreign Exchange: Forward exchange contracts receivable positions 4,300 (d) 2,600 (d) (23,500 ) (e) (17,600 ) (e) Forward exchange contracts liability positions (100 ) (d) (200 ) (d) (2,100 ) (e) (3,700 ) (e) (a) The fair market value of our investment in marketable securities, excluding repurchase agreements, is based on the quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2010 and 2009. (b) The fair values of our 4.875% Senior Notes due July 1, 2015, 5.15% Senior Notes due September 1, 2014, 5.875% Senior Notes due May 1, 2019 and 5.70% Senior Notes due October 15, 2039 are based on the quoted market prices on December 31, 2010. (c) The calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points at December 31, 2010 and 2009. (d) The fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is based on both quoted market prices and valuations derived from pricing models on December 31, 2010 and 2009. (e) The calculation of estimated foreign exchange risk assumes an instantaneous 20% decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their values at December 31, 2010 and 2009, with all other variables held constant. 50 Table of Contents
