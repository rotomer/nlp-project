Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements (including the Notes thereto) in Item 8 of this report. We provide contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe and are a leader in offshore drilling. Our fleet of 49 offshore drilling rigs consists of 32 semisubmersibles, 13 jack ups and four dynamically positioned drillships, three of which are under construction with delivery expected in the second and fourth quarters of 2013 and in the second quarter of 2014. In addition, in January 2012, we announced the construction of a moored semisubmersible rig that will be designed to operate in water depths up to 6,000 feet. The rig, to be named the Ocean Onyx, will be constructed utilizing the hull of one of our mid water floaters that previously operated as the Ocean Voyager. Of our fleet, eight rigs are currently cold stacked, consisting of three intermediate semisubmersibles (one in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, or GOM, and two in Malaysia) and five jack up rigs (four in the GOM and one in Malaysia). Overview International Floater Market Our floating rigs accounted for approximately 94% of our contract drilling revenue during the 2011. As of the date of this report, industry wide floater utilization is reported to be greater than 90%, and, as of February 1, 2012, our floating rigs were committed for approximately 75% of the days remaining in 2012 and 54% of 2013. Internationally, the ultra deepwater and deepwater floater markets are generally strong and also show signs of further strengthening, particularly in the ultra deepwater segment where we believe that there are few uncontracted rigs available to work in 2012. However, based on a December 2011 analyst report, there are 49 ultra deepwater and deepwater floaters under construction, which are expected to enter the market in 2012 and 2013. Many of these floaters, primarily those scheduled for delivery in 2013, are not yet contracted for future work. Market strength for ultra deepwater and deepwater rigs varies among geographic regions. Upcoming drilling programs offshore Brazil will require a number of additional ultra deepwater rigs. This demand may be met by rigs contructed domestically in Brazil, including 33 deepwater floaters ordered by Petrobras. However, additional demand for ultra deepwater rigs could develop if Brazilian drilling programs, including those of Petrobras, are accelerated prior to delivery of domestically constructed rigs. In addition, successful exploration and development programs in West Africa have given rise to a robust market for deepwater and ultra deepwater rigs in that region. Market strength for mid water floaters is stable or improving depending on the geographic market. In the North Sea, the mid water market is strong, with signs of increasing dayrates, and, in the Mediterranean region, demand remains solid. The Southeast Asia and Australia markets also remain steady. Worldwide Jack up Market Four of our marketed jack up rigs are currently operating in the Mexican waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where drilling activity remains stable and additional tendering activity is ongoing. Of our two remaining marketed international jack ups, one is currently working in Egypt, and the other, located in Montenegro, is actively seeking work. GOM Floater and Jack up Market Deepwater drilling activity in the GOM, while strengthening, continues to be impacted by the issuance of oil and gas drilling permits for operations on the OCS, which has not yet returned to pre Macondo levels. In addition, since the Macondo well blowout in 2010 more stringent and encompassing rules for oil and gas operations on the OCS have been implemented. As of the date of this report, we have two actively marketed rigs in the GOM, consisting of one semisubmersible and one jack up rig. The Ocean Victory and Ocean Columbia are currently operating in the GOM, both with contract backlog extending into the second quarter of 2012. The construction of our deepwater, moored semisubmersible rig, the Ocean Onyx, is taking place in a shipyard in Brownsville, Texas. 22 Table of Contents Contract Drilling Backlog The following table reflects our contract drilling backlog as of February 1, 2012, October 17, 2011 (the date reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011) and February 1, 2011 (the date reported in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010). Contract drilling backlog is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period and adding one half of any potential rig performance bonuses. Our calculation also assumes full utilization of our drilling equipment for the contract period (excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days); however, the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors. Utilization rates, which generally approach 92 98% during contracted periods, can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including, but not limited to, weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance. Contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and customer reimbursables. No revenue is generally earned during periods of downtime for regulatory surveys. Changes in our contract drilling backlog between periods are a function of the performance of work on term contracts, as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts.

The following table reflects the percentage of rig days committed by year as of February 1, 2012. The percentage of rig days committed is calculated as the ratio of total days committed under contracts, as well as scheduled shipyard, survey and mobilization days for all rigs in our fleet, to total available days (number of rigs multiplied by the number of days in a particular year). Total available days have been calculated based on the expected final commissioning dates for the Ocean BlackHawk, Ocean BlackHornet, Ocean BlackRhino and the Ocean Onyx, which are all under construction.

General The two most significant variables affecting our revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates, each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace. Demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development, as well as a variety of political, regulatory and economic factors. The availability of rigs in a particular geographical region also affects both dayrates and utilization rates. These factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict. Demand affects the number of days our fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned. As utilization rates increase, dayrates tend to increase as well, reflecting the lower supply of available rigs. Conversely, as utilization rates decrease, dayrates tend to decrease as well, reflecting the excess supply of rigs. When a rig is idle, no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result. Revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs, required surveys and shipyard upgrades. In order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates, we may mobilize our rigs from one market to another. However, during periods of mobilization, revenues may be adversely affected. As a response to changes in demand, we may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously, which may decrease or increase revenues, respectively. We recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed. In connection with such drilling contracts, we may receive fees (either lump sum or dayrate) for the mobilization of equipment. We earn these fees as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. We defer mobilization fees received, as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred, and amortize each, on a straight line basis, over the term of the related drilling contracts (which is the period we estimate to be benefited from the mobilization activity). Straight line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts (which generally range from two to 60 months) is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed. Absent a contract, mobilization costs are recognized currently. From time to time, we may receive fees from our customers for capital improvements to our rigs (either lump sum or dayrate). We defer such fees and recognize them into income on a straight line basis over the period of the related drilling contract as a component of contract drilling revenue. We capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of the improvement. 24 Table of Contents As a result of anticipated downtime in the current year for rig mobilizations, regulatory surveys and shipyard projects, we expect contract drilling revenue in 2012 to decline from the levels attained in 2011. We also expect contract drilling revenue for some of our rigs to be lower as these rigs fulfill term commitments under contracts at lower dayrates than previously earned in 2011 and may not be able to benefit from higher dayrates that the market is currently bearing. See Risk Factors The terms of our drilling contracts may limit our ability to attain profitability in a declining market or to benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market in Item 1A of this report. We receive reimbursements for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services and other services provided at the request of our customers in accordance with a contract or agreement. We record these reimbursements at the gross amount billed to the customer as Revenues related to reimbursable expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in Item 8 of this report. Operating Income. Our operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors, but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses. Our operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling equipment. The principal components of our operating costs are, among other things, direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory inspections, boat and helicopter rentals and insurance. Labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most significant components of our operating expenses. In general, our labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels, rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which our rigs operate. In addition, the costs associated with training new and seasoned employees can be significant. We expect our labor and training costs to increase in 2012 as a result of increased hiring and training activities as we continue the process of crewing three new drillships. Costs to repair and maintain our equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing, as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the regions in which our rigs are working. Our operating costs are also impacted by the regulatory environments in which we operate. The adoption of new regulations could result in additional inspection and certification costs, as well as require additional capital investment to comply with regulatory requirements. Accordingly, we cannot fully predict the financial impact of any new regulations that may arise relating to drilling activities in the GOM, or elsewhere in the world. New laws or regulations may require an increase in our capital spending for additional equipment to comply with such requirements. Our business could be negatively impacted by additional downtime which may be required to obtain necessary equipment and to install such equipment or to obtain the required inspections or certifications as prescribed under such regulations. Operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates, and short term reductions in utilization do not necessarily result in lower operating expenses. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or warm stacked state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract. However, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, we may reduce the size of a rigs crew and take steps to cold stack the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income. We recognize, as incurred, operating expenses related to activities such as inspections, painting projects and routine overhauls that meet certain criteria and which maintain rather than upgrade our rigs. These expenses vary from period to period. Costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements. Higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods following capital upgrades. Our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections, which we refer to as a 5 year survey, or special survey, that are due every five years for each of our rigs. Operating revenue decreases because these special surveys are performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard. Operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs. Repair and maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of rigs undergoing a 5 year survey will vary from year to year, as well as from quarter to quarter. In addition, operating income may be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim periods between 5 year surveys. Intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a 5 year survey. Although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the drilling rig, it normally does not require dry docking or shipyard time, except for rigs located in the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. 25 Table of Contents During 2012, 11 of our rigs will require 5 year surveys and one of our U.K. rigs will require dry docking for inspections. We expect these 12 rigs to be out of service for approximately 660 days in the aggregate. We also expect to spend an additional approximately 440 days during 2012 for intermediate surveys, the mobilization of rigs, contract acceptance testing and extended maintenance projects. We can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and or duration of downtime associated with regulatory inspections, planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects. See Overview Contract Drilling Backlog. We are self insured for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. If a named windstorm in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico causes significant damage to our rigs or equipment, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Under our insurance policy that expires on May 1, 2012, we carry physical damage insurance for certain losses other than those caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for which our deductible for physical damage is $25.0 million per occurrence. We do not typically retain loss of hire insurance policies to cover our rigs. In addition, under our insurance policy that expires on May 1, 2012, we carry marine liability insurance covering certain legal liabilities, including coverage for certain personal injury claims, with no exclusions for pollution and or environmental risk. We believe that the policy limit for our marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of our size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for our business. Our deductibles for marine liability coverage, including for personal injury claims, are $10.0 million for the first occurrence and vary in amounts ranging between $5.0 million and, if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds, up to $100.0 million for each subsequent occurrence, depending on the nature, severity and frequency of claims which might arise during the policy year, which under the current policy commences on May 1 of each year. Construction and Capital Upgrade Projects. We capitalize interest cost for the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP. The period of interest capitalization covers the duration of the activities required to make the asset ready for its intended use, and the capitalization period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we capitalized interest of $11.2 million on qualifying expenditures related to the construction of our three new drillships, beginning in August 2011. In addition, during 2012, we also expect to capitalize interest related to the construction of the Ocean Onyx. Critical Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 General Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Judgments, assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies. We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows: Property, Plant and Equipment. We carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost. Maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments, which upgrade or increase the functionality of our existing equipment and that significantly extend the useful life of an existing asset, are capitalized. Significant judgments, assumptions and estimates may be required in determining whether or not such replacements and betterments meet the criteria for capitalization and in determining useful lives and salvage values of such assets. Changes in these judgments, assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported. Historically, the amount of capital additions requiring significant judgments, assumptions or estimates has not been significant. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we capitalized $269.5 million and $379.8 million, respectively, in replacements and betterments of our drilling fleet, resulting from numerous projects ranging from $25,000 to $50 million per project. We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable (such as cold stacking a rig or excess spending over budget on a newbuild, construction project or major rig upgrade). We utilize a probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. Our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following: dayrate by rig; utilization rate by rig (expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used); the per day operating cost for each rig if active, warm stacked or cold stacked; the estimated annual cost for rig replacements and or enhancement programs; 26 Table of Contents the estimated maintenance, inspection or other costs associated with a rig returning to work; salvage value for each rig; and estimated proceeds that may be received on disposition of the rig. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we develop a matrix using several different utilization/dayrate scenarios, to each of which we have assigned a probability of occurrence. The sum of our utilization scenarios (which include active, warm stacked and cold stacked) and probability of occurrence scenarios both equal 100% in the aggregate. We reevaluate our cold stacked rigs annually, and we update the matrices for each of our cold stacked rigs at each year end and modify our assumptions giving consideration to the length of time the rig has been cold stacked, the current and expected market for the type of rig and expectations of future oil and gas prices. Further, to test sensitivity, we consider the impact of a 5% reduction in assumed dayrates for the cold stacked rigs (holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant). We would not necessarily record an impairment if the sensitivity analysis indicated potential cash flows would be insufficient to recover our carrying value. We would assess other qualitative factors including industry, regulatory and other relevant conditions to determine whether an impairment or further disclosure is warranted. A summary of our cold stacked rigs evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was as follows: December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions, except number of rigs) Mid Water semisubmersibles 3 3 1 Jack ups 5 4 3 Total 8 7 4 Aggregate net book value $ 76.5 $ 78.0 $ 20.2 We performed an impairment review for each of these rigs using the methodology described above. Based on our analyses, we concluded that these eight, seven and four rigs were not subject to impairment at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Managements assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. Personal Injury Claims. Our deductibles for liability coverage for personal injury claims, which primarily result from Jones Act liability in the Gulf of Mexico, is $10.0 million per the first occurrence, with no aggregate deductible, and vary in amounts ranging between $5.0 million and, if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds, up to $100.0 million for each subsequent occurrence, depending on the nature, severity and frequency of claims which might arise during the policy year. The Jones Act is a federal law that permits seamen to seek compensation for certain injuries during the course of their employment on a vessel and governs the liability of vessel operators and marine employers for the work related injury or death of an employee. We engage outside consultants to assist us in estimating our aggregate liability for personal injury claims based on our historical losses and utilizing various actuarial models. The models used in estimating our aggregate reserve for personal injury claims include actuarial assumptions such as: claim emergence, or the delay between occurrence and recording of claims; settlement patterns, or the rates at which claims are closed; development patterns, or the rate at which known cases develop to their ultimate level; average, potential frequency and severity of claims; and effect of re opened claims. 27 Table of Contents The eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from our estimated amounts due to uncertainties such as: the severity of personal injuries claimed; significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims; the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated; inconsistent court decisions; and the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards that require the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if necessary, which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach. We do not establish deferred tax liabilities for certain of our foreign earnings that we intend to indefinitely reinvest to finance foreign activities. However, if these earnings become subject to U.S. federal tax, any required provision could have a material impact on our financial results. We make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to the forecasting of our effective tax rate, the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits, and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit. Certain of our international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited, or DOIL, a Cayman Islands subsidiary which we wholly own. It is our intention to indefinitely reinvest future earnings of DOIL and its foreign subsidiaries to finance foreign activities. Accordingly, we have not made a provision for U.S. income taxes on approximately $1.7 billion of undistributed foreign earnings and profits. Although we do not intend to repatriate the earnings of DOIL and have not provided U.S. income taxes for such earnings, except to the extent that such earnings were immediately subject to U.S. income taxes, these earnings could become subject to U.S. income tax if remitted, or if deemed remitted as a dividend; however, it is not practicable to estimate this potential liability. In several of the international locations in which we operate, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries enter into agreements with other of our wholly owned subsidiaries to provide specialized services and equipment in support of our foreign operations. We apply a transfer pricing methodology to determine the amount to be charged for providing the services and equipment, and utilize outside consultants to assist us in the development of such transfer pricing methodologies. In most cases, there are alternative transfer pricing methodologies that could be applied to these transactions and, if applied, could result in different chargeable amounts. We record interest related to accrued unrecognized tax positions in interest expense and recognize penalties associated with uncertain tax positions in our tax expense. 28 Table of Contents Results of Operations Although we perform contract drilling services with different types of drilling rigs and in many geographic locations, there is a similarity of economic characteristics among all our divisions and locations, including the nature of services provided and the type of customers for our services. We believe that the combination of our drilling rigs into one reportable segment is the appropriate aggregation in accordance with applicable accounting standards on segment reporting. However, for purposes of this discussion and analysis of our results of operations, we provide greater detail with respect to the types of rigs in our fleet to enhance the readers understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. Key performance indicators by equipment type are listed below.

Total operating income in 2011 decreased $170.0 million, or 12%, compared to 2010, despite a $24.6 million, or 1%, increase in total contract drilling revenue during 2011. Revenue generated by our floater rigs increased an aggregate $95.1 million, or 3%, in 2011 compared to 2010, while revenue generated by our jack up fleet declined $70.4 million or 26%. Except for our deepwater floaters, average daily revenue earned by our other rigs during 2011 compared unfavorably to the levels attained in 2010. Utilization for our ultra deepwater and deepwater floaters increased significantly in 2011 compared to 2010; however, utilization for our mid water floater and jack ups fleets decreased in 2011. One additional mid water floater and one jack up rig were cold stacked during 2011. Our two newest floaters, the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor, which began operating under contract late in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter of 2010, respectively, contributed incremental revenue of $162.0 million during 2011. 31 Table of Contents Total contract drilling expense increased $157.4 million, or 11%, during 2011 compared to 2010, reflecting incremental contract drilling expense for the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor, higher amortized mobilization costs and higher other operating costs associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically. Other significant factors that affected the comparability of our operating income for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Bad Debt Recovery (Expense). During 2011, we recorded a $5.7 million provision for bad debts to reserve a portion of the uncollected balance of receivables related to our operations in Egypt and recovered $12.3 million in previously recorded reserves for bad debts. During 2010, we recovered $5.6 million and $4.2 million related to previously established reserves for bad debts related to our operations in Egypt and the U.K., respectively. Gain on Disposition of Assets. During 2011, we recognized an aggregate $4.8 million gain on the disposition of assets, primarily related to the sale of used equipment, compared to an aggregate $34.7 million net gain recognized in the prior year. During 2010, we sold the Ocean Shield for net proceeds of $183.3 million and recognized a net gain on sale of $32.8 million. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $17.6 million in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to $11.2 million of interest capitalized in 2011 on our three drillships under construction. In addition, during 2011, we recorded $0.2 million of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions compared to $4.8 million during 2010. Income Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was 18.4%, compared to a 28.5% effective tax rate for 2010. The lower effective tax rate in the current year is primarily the result of differences in the mix of our domestic and international pre tax earnings and losses, as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. As our rigs frequently operate in different tax jurisdictions as they move from contract to contract, our effective tax rate can fluctuate substantially and our historical effective tax rates may not be sustainable and could increase materially. Also contributing to our lower effective tax rate in 2011, compared to the prior year, was the impact of a tax law provision that expired at the end of 2009 but was subsequently signed back into law in December 2010. This provision allows us to defer recognition of certain foreign earnings for U.S. tax purposes. The extension of this tax law provision, and our decisions to build three new drillships overseas, caused us to reassess our intent to repatriate certain foreign earnings to the U.S. We now plan to reinvest these earnings internationally, and consequently, we are no longer providing U.S. income taxes on these earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we reversed the $15.0 million of U.S. income taxes that had been provided in 2010 for these earnings. On December 31, 2011, the statute of limitations relative to a 2006 uncertain tax position in Brazil expired. As a consequence, in 2011 we reversed $1.1 million of previously accrued interest expense and $5.7 million of previously accrued tax expense, $2.0 million of which had been accrued for penalties. During 2010, we accrued approximately $35.7 million of expense for uncertain tax positions, primarily in Mexico and Brazil, of which $4.8 million was interest and $12.0 million was penalty related. 2010 Compared to 2009 Operating Income. Operating income in 2010 decreased $477.8 million, or 25%, compared to 2009. Our operating results were negatively impacted by a decline in average daily revenue earned by our rigs in 2010 from the levels attained in 2009. While our contracted revenue backlog enabled us to partially mitigate the impact of the weakened market conditions at the time, our total contract drilling revenue decreased $306.8 million, or 9%, compared to 2009. Revenue generated by our floater fleet decreased an aggregate $117.8 million, or 4%, and revenue for our jack up fleet decreased $189.2 million, or 41%, during 2010 compared to the previous year. During 2010, we cold stacked three additional rigs in the GOM, consisting of two mid water floaters that returned from Mexico during the year and one jack up rig. However, the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor, which commenced drilling operations during 2010, contributed $109.3 million to our revenue during 2010. Total contract drilling expense increased $167.3 million, or 14%, in 2010 compared to 2009, and included normal operating costs for the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor, as well as increased amortized mobilization costs and higher other operating costs associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically. 32 Table of Contents Other significant factors that affected the comparability of our operating income for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Bad Debt Expense. During 2010, we recovered $9.7 million in previously established reserves for bad debts related to our operations in Egypt and the U.K. During 2009, we recorded a $10.7 million provision for bad debts to reserve a portion of the uncollected balance of receivables related to our operations in Egypt and recovered $0.9 million related to a previously established reserve for bad debt recorded in 2008 related to our operations in the U.K. Depreciation Expense. Depreciation expense increased $46.7 million, or 13%, during 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to depreciation associated with capital additions in 2009 and 2010, and included depreciation expense for the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor, which were placed in service in September 2009 and March 2010, respectively. Gain on Disposition of Assets. Net gain on disposition of assets in 2010 was primarily related to the sale of the Ocean Shield. Net gain on disposition of assets in 2009 included a $6.7 million gain on the sale of the Ocean Tower, which was damaged during a hurricane in 2008. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $41.1 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a full year of interest expense in 2010 for our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2019, or 5.875% Senior Notes, and our 5.70% Senior Notes due 2039, or 5.70% Senior Notes, issued in May 2009 and October 2009, respectively ($31.9 million). In addition, during 2010, we recorded $4.8 million in interest expense related to uncertain tax positions compared to a $3.4 million net reduction, during 2009, of accrued interest expense related to an uncertain tax position for which the statute of limitations had expired. Foreign Currency Transaction Gain (Loss). During 2009, we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of $11.5 million, which included $8.9 million in realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency forward exchange, or FOREX, contracts ($37.3 million in net unrealized gains from mark to market accounting and $28.4 million in net realized losses on settled FOREX contracts not designated as accounting hedges). During 2010, we designated all of our FOREX contracts as accounting hedges and, as such, gains and losses on the settlement of these hedged contracts were recorded as a component of operating expenses under Contract drilling, excluding depreciation. Income Tax Expense. Our income tax expense is a function of the mix between our domestic and international pre tax earnings or losses, as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognized $380.6 million of tax expense on pre tax income of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to tax expense of $492.2 million on pre tax income of $1.9 billion in 2009. The effective annual tax rate of 28.5% in 2010 compared unfavorably to the effective annual tax rate of 26.3% in 2009 primarily due to higher taxes for income tax contingencies, as well as taxes associated with the sale of the Ocean Shield. During 2010, we accrued approximately $35.7 million of expense for uncertain tax positions, primarily in Mexico and Brazil, of which $4.8 million was interest and $12.0 million was penalty related. On March 31, 2009, the statute of limitations relative to a 2003 uncertain tax position in Mexico expired. As a consequence, we reversed $5.5 million of previously accrued interest expense and $5.9 million of previously accrued tax expense, $0.8 million of which had been accrued for penalties. 33 Table of Contents Contract Drilling Revenue and Expense by Equipment Type 2011 Compared to 2010 Ultra Deepwater Floaters. Revenue generated by our ultra deepwater floaters increased $123.1 million during 2011 compared to 2010. Our newest rigs, the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor, were under contract in Brazil for all of 2011 and worked a combined 353 incremental revenue earning days, compared to 2010, generating $162.0 million in incremental revenue. However, aggregate revenue earned by our six other ultra deepwater rigs decreased $38.9 million in 2011 compared to 2010, due to a reduction in average daily revenue earned ($71.5 million), partially offset by an increase in revenue earning days ($57.2 million) due to the absence of downtime in 2011 associated with the relocation of the Ocean Endeavor, Ocean Confidence and Ocean Baroness from the GOM to international locations in the previous year. In addition, 2011 revenue was unfavorably impacted by the absence of a $30.7 million contract termination fee earned by the Ocean Endeavor in July 2010, partially offset by higher recognition of mobilization revenue during 2011 ($6.1 million). Contract drilling expense for our ultra deepwater floaters increased $172.5 million in 2011 compared to 2010, and included $75.4 million in incremental contract drilling expense from the operation of the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor, $16.6 million in incremental mobilization expenses, and higher overall contract drilling expenses for the remainder of our fleet, including personnel related, maintenance and hull insurance costs, as well as higher costs associated with operating rigs internationally, such as freight, non income based taxes, revenue based agency fees and shorebase support costs. Deepwater Floaters. Revenue generated by our deepwater floaters increased $168.7 million in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to 376 additional revenue earning days ($151.5 million) and an increase in average daily revenue earned ($25.1 million). The increase in revenue earning days in 2011 resulted from 209 fewer non operating days for repairs, inspections and contract preparation activities, 87 fewer rig mobilization days and 80 fewer days in which rigs were warm stacked between contracts, compared to the prior year. The increase in revenue was partially offset by the recognition of less amortized mobilization revenue in 2011 compared to the prior year ($7.8 million). Contract drilling expense increased $8.0 million in 2011, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the Ocean America operating offshore Australia for all of 2011, compared to the prior year when the rig did not commence drilling operations until June 2010 ($27.3 million). Higher incremental contract drilling expense was partially offset by a $16.1 million reduction in recognized mobilization costs due to the full amortization of previously deferred costs as rigs completed their initial contracts and the absence of mobilization costs associated with the Ocean Alliances shipyard project in 2010. Mid Water Floaters. Revenue generated by our mid water floaters decreased $196.8 million in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to 546 fewer revenue earning days ($153.4 million) combined with a decrease in average daily revenue earned ($59.3 million) in 2011. The decrease in revenue earning days was primarily attributable to 963 additional cold stacked days in 2011 compared to 2010, partially offset by fewer warm stacked days between contracts (282 fewer days), unpaid downtime for repairs (84 fewer days) and rig mobilization days (51 fewer days). The decline in revenue was partially offset by higher mobilization fees recognized during 2011 ($15.9 million) compared to 2010, primarily due to a $24.0 million demobilization fee earned by the Ocean Yorktown upon completion of its contract offshore Brazil. Contract drilling expense decreased $8.9 million during 2011 compared to 2010. Contributing to the overall decrease in contract drilling expense between periods was a $67.6 million reduction in costs associated with cold stacked rigs, partially offset by higher contract drilling expense for our actively marketed fleet of 16 mid water floaters. Cost increases in 2011, compared to 2010, included personnel related costs ($21.7 million), repairs and maintenance expenses ($4.3 million), shorebase support and overhead costs ($16.7 million), as well as costs associated with the demobilization of the Ocean Yorktown to the GOM in advance of the rigs future work in Mexico in early 2012. Jack ups. Revenue earned by our jack up rigs decreased $70.4 million in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to 810 fewer revenue earning days ($71.0 million) in 2011 reflecting the impact of the cold stacking of rigs during the periods (331 fewer days), the sale of the Ocean Shield in July 2010 (232 fewer days) and an increase in warm stacked days in between contracts (319 days), partially offset by 72 fewer non revenue earning days for repairs and mobilization of rigs. Contract drilling expense declined $20.9 million in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to reduced expense for our cold stacked rigs ($9.5 million) and the Ocean Shield ($19.4 million). Contract drilling expense for our actively marketed jack up rigs increased $8.0 million during 2011, primarily due to higher rig mobilization costs, including costs related to the mobilization of the Ocean Scepter to the GOM, inspection costs and hull insurance. 34 Table of Contents 2010 Compared to 2009 Ultra Deepwater Floaters. Revenue generated by our ultra deepwater floaters decreased $27.6 million during 2010 compared to 2009. Our newest ultra deepwater rigs, the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor, generated $109.3 million in revenue during 2010 and worked a combined 280 revenue earning days. However, aggregate revenue earned by our other six ultra deepwater rigs decreased $137.0 million in 2010 compared to 2009, due to 437 fewer revenue earning days ($160.4 million), largely resulting from effects of the April 20, 2010 Macondo well blowout in the GOM, as well as a decrease in average daily revenue earned ($19.3 million). The decline in 2010 revenue was partially offset by the recognition of $12.0 million in incremental mobilization revenue, compared to the prior year, and the receipt of a $30.7 million contract termination fee from a previous customer of the Ocean Endeavor in July 2010. The decrease in revenue earning days in 2010 was primarily attributable to increased downtime associated with incremental mobilization, contract preparation and customer acceptance days for three of our ultra deepwater rigs that were relocated from the GOM to international locations in 2010 and unplanned downtime due to a force majeure assertion by one of our customers in the GOM following the Macondo incident. Contract drilling expense for our ultra deepwater floaters increased $111.0 million in 2010 compared to 2009, and included $85.1 million in incremental contract drilling expense incurred by the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor, as well as $11.7 million in incremental mobilization expenses. Contract drilling expense in 2010 also reflected higher maintenance, inspection, freight, non income based taxes and other revenue based fees, partially offset by lower personnel and related costs, including a lower U.S. labor component as more of our rigs worked internationally in 2010 compared to the prior year. Deepwater Floaters. Revenue generated by our deepwater floaters increased $38.4 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to 44 additional revenue earning days ($17.4 million). The increase in revenue earning days in 2010, compared to the prior year, resulted from 165 fewer warm stacked days between contracts, partially offset by 80 additional non revenue earning days due to scheduled shipyard time for inspections, repairs and contract preparation activities and 45 incremental rig mobilization days. In addition, during 2010, we recognized $21.0 million in incremental mobilization revenue compared to the prior year. Contract drilling expense increased $46.8 million in 2010, compared to the prior year, primarily due to $19.7 million in incremental mobilization expense, including amortized mobilization costs, increased personnel related costs ($12.4 million), higher revenue based fees ($4.0 million) and shorebase support costs ($9.8 million), which included costs related to our recently established Angola operations and higher costs related to our expanded operations offshore Brazil. Mid Water Floaters. Revenue generated by our mid water floaters decreased $128.6 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to 397 fewer revenue earning days ($114.4 million) combined with a decrease in average daily revenue earned ($39.9 million) in 2010. The decrease in revenue earning days was primarily attributable to increased downtime during 2010 for repairs (95 days) and the cold stacking of rigs (492 days), partially offset by fewer mobilization days (142 fewer days) and warm stacked days (40 fewer days). The impact of these negative factors was partially offset by the recognition of $25.7 million in incremental mobilization fees during 2010 compared to 2009. Contract drilling expense increased $59.1 million during 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to higher personnel related expenses ($35.7 million), rig mobilization costs ($8.4 million), including amortized mobilization expenses, revenue based fees and taxes ($11.1 million) and shorebase support (Brazil and the Falkland Islands) and overhead costs ($7.7 million). Jack ups. Revenue earned by our jack up rigs decreased $189.2 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a decrease in average daily revenue earned ($120.0 million) combined with the effect of 354 fewer revenue earning days ($45.1 million) due to the sale of the Ocean Shield and the impact of our cold stacked rigs, including an additional jack up rig cold stacked in September 2010, partially offset by a decrease in downtime between contracts for our actively marketed jack ups. The decrease in average daily revenue earned during 2010 resulted primarily from all of our jack up rigs working at lower dayrates than those earned during 2009 due to weakened market conditions at the time. Comparing periods, the decrease in revenue in 2010 was also attributable to a reduction of $15.4 million in deferred mobilization revenue recognized in 2010 and an $8.8 million demobilization fee earned in 2009 by the Ocean Scepter upon completion of its contract offshore Argentina. Contract drilling expense decreased $45.8 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to reduced expense for our cold stacked rigs ($26.3 million) and the Ocean Shield ($13.1 million), which we sold in July 2010. Contract drilling expense for our actively marketed jack up rigs decreased $6.4 million during 2010 compared to 2009. 35 Table of Contents Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from our operations and our cash reserves. At December 31, 2011, we had $333.8 million in Cash and cash equivalents and $902.4 million in Marketable securities, representing our investment of cash available for current operations. We terminated our $285 million credit facility on October 12, 2011, prior to its contractual maturity on November 2, 2011. Liquidity and Capital Requirements Our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements. We determine the amount of cash required to meet our capital commitments by evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements, our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, and our obligations relating to the construction of our three new drillships. As a result of our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of DOIL to finance our foreign activities, we do not expect such earnings to be available for distribution to our stockholders or to finance our domestic activities. See Overview Critical Accounting Estimates Income Taxes. However, we believe that the operating cash flows generated by and cash reserves of DOIL, and the operating cash flows available to and cash reserves of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. will be sufficient to meet their respective working capital requirements and capital commitments over the next twelve months. We will, however, continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions and will adjust capital spending programs if required. In addition, we may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. Our ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity securities will be dependent on our results of operations, our current financial condition, current market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Contractual Cash Obligations. The following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2011. Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5years (In thousands) Long term debt (principal and interest) (1) $ 2,605,690 $ 82,938 $ 415,876 $ 377,938 $ 1,728,938 Construction contracts (2) 1,262,079 80,300 1,181,779 Operating leases 3,700 1,800 1,800 100 Total obligations $ 3,871,469 $ 165,038 $ 1,599,455 $ 378,038 $ 1,728,938 (1) See Note 9 Long Term Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. (2) During 2011, we entered into an agreement with Keppel AmFELS, L.L.C., or Keppel, for the construction of a deepwater semisubmersible rig, the Ocean Onyx. In December 2010 and during the first half of 2011, we entered into three separate turnkey construction contracts with Hyundai for the construction of three ultra deepwater drillships. See Capital Expenditures and Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Obligations to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The above table excludes FOREX contracts in the aggregate notional amount of $154.3 million outstanding at December 31, 2011. See further information regarding these contracts in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Exchange Risk and Note 6 Derivative Financial Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. As of December 31, 2011, the total unrecognized tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions was $41.2 million. In addition, we have recorded a liability, as of December 31, 2011, for potential penalties and interest of $22.5 million and $8.9 million, respectively, related to the tax benefit of uncertain tax positions. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with the liabilities recognized in this balance, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. 36 Table of Contents Except for the construction contracts discussed in the preceding table, we had no other purchase obligations for major rig upgrades or any other significant obligations at December 31, 2011, except for those related to our direct rig operations, which arise during the normal course of business. Other Commercial Commitments Letters of Credit. We were contingently liable as of December 31, 2011 in the amount of $108.4 million under certain performance, bid, supersedeas, tax appeal and custom bonds and letters of credit. We purchased one $11.8 million bond from a related party after obtaining competitive quotes. Agreements relating to approximately $88.2 million of performance bonds can require collateral at any time. As of December 31, 2011, we had not been required to make any collateral deposits with respect to these agreements. The remaining agreements cannot require collateral except in events of default. Banks have issued letters of credit on our behalf securing certain of these bonds. See Note 12 Related Party Transactions to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. The table below provides a list of these obligations in U.S. dollar equivalents and their time to expiration.

Our current credit rating is Baa1 for Moodys Investors Services and A for Standard & Poors. Although our long term ratings continue at investment grade levels, lower ratings could result in higher interest rates on future debt issuances. Capital Expenditures. In December 2011, we entered into an agreement with Keppel, in Brownsville, Texas, for the construction of a moored semisubmersible rig designed to operate in water depths up to 6,000 feet. The rig will be constructed utilizing the hull of one of our mid water floaters that previously operated as the Ocean Voyager. The project is estimated to be completed in the third quarter of 2013 at an aggregate cost of approximately $300 million, including commissioning, spares and project management costs. In addition, since December 2010, we have entered into three separate turnkey contracts with Hyundai for the construction of three dynamically positioned, ultra deepwater drillships, with deliveries scheduled for the second and fourth quarters of 2013 and in the second quarter of 2014. The aggregate cost of the three drillships, including commissioning, spares and project management, is expected to be approximately $1.8 billion. For 2012, we have budgeted approximately $220.0 million for capital expenditures associated with the construction of our new drillships and the Ocean Onyx and an additional $330.0 million for capital expenditures associated with our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs and other corporate requirements. We expect to finance our 2012 capital expenditures through the use of our existing cash balances or internally generated funds. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no off balance sheet debt or other arrangements. 37 Table of Contents Historical Cash Flows The following is a discussion of our historical cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Change (In thousands) Net income $ 962,542 $ 955,457 $ 7,085 Net changes in operating assets and liabilities 20,524 (3,119 ) 23,643 Proceeds from settlement of FOREX contracts designated as accounting hedges 7,206 3,307 3,899 Gain on sale and disposition of assets (4,758 ) (34,714 ) 29,956 Deferred tax provision (benefit) 2,141 (6,916 ) 9,057 Depreciation and other non cash items, net 432,450 368,303 64,147 $ 1,420,105 $ 1,282,318 $ 137,787 Our cash flows from operations in 2011 increased $137.8 million compared to 2010. Non cash adjustments to net income during 2011 were $437.0 million, compared to $330.0 million during 2010, and included a net $21.1 million adjustment for the recognition of mobilization fees received and expenses incurred in previous years. Non cash adjustments during 2010 included a $(41.4) million net deferral of fees received and cash spent in connection with the mobilization of rigs during 2010 and a $32.8 million gain from the 2010 sale of the Ocean Shield. Operating cash flows were favorably impacted by a decrease in net cash required to satisfy working capital requirements in 2011 compared to 2010. We used $23.6 million less cash to satisfy working capital needs during 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to lower estimated income taxes paid in the U.S. federal jurisdiction partially offset by higher foreign income tax payments. During 2011, we made U.S. federal income tax payments and paid foreign income taxes, net of refunds, of $94.8 million and $150.5 million, respectively. During 2010, we made U.S. federal income tax payments and paid foreign income taxes, net of refunds, of $427.5 million and $128.5 million, respectively. Trade and other receivables generated cash of $60.8 million in 2011 compared to generating cash of $143.1 million in 2010. We used $43.2 million more cash to satisfy accounts payable and accrued liability needs during 2011 compared to 2010. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Change (In thousands) Purchase of marketable securities $ (5,653,665 ) $ (5,660,518 ) $ 6,853 Proceeds from sale and maturities of marketable securities 5,362,138 5,450,230 (88,092) Capital expenditures (including rig construction) (774,756 ) (434,262 ) (340,494) Proceeds from disposition of assets 5,603 188,066 (182,463) $ (1,060,680 ) $ (456,484 ) $ (604,196) Our investing activities used $1.1 billion in 2011 compared to $456.5 million in 2010. We purchased marketable securities, net of sales, of $291.5 million and $210.3 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our level of investment activity is dependent on our working capital and other capital requirements during the year, as well as a response to actual or anticipated events or conditions in the securities markets. During 2011, we spent $490.2 million towards the construction of our three new drillships. See Liquidity and Capital Requirements Contractual Cash Obligations and Liquidity and Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures. We spent an additional $284.6 million during 2011 related to ongoing capital maintenance programs, including rig modifications to meet contractual requirements, compared to $434.3 million in 2010. Capital expenditures in 2010 also included commissioning and initial outfitting costs of the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor. 38 Table of Contents On July 7, 2010, we completed the sale of the Ocean Shield for net proceeds of $185.3 million. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Change (In thousands) Payment of dividends $ (490,057 ) $ (733,661 ) $ 243,604 Redemption of zero coupon debentures (4,238 ) 4,238 Other 4 41 (37) $ (490,053 ) $ (737,858 ) $ 247,805 During 2011, we paid cash dividends totaling $490.1 million, consisting of aggregate regular and special cash dividends of $69.5 million and $420.6 million, respectively. During 2010, we paid cash dividends totaling $733.7 million, consisting of aggregate regular and special cash dividends of $69.5 million and $664.2 million, respectively. On February 1, 2012, we declared a regular cash dividend and a special cash dividend of $0.125 and $0.75, respectively, per share of our common stock. Both the quarterly and special cash dividends are payable on March 1, 2012 to stockholders of record on February 13, 2012. On May 28, 2010, we redeemed the then outstanding $4.2 million accreted value, or $6.0 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity, of our Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures due 2020, at a redemption price of $706.28 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity for cash. Our Board of Directors has adopted a policy to consider paying special cash dividends, in amounts to be determined, on a quarterly basis. Our Board of Directors may, in subsequent quarters, consider paying additional special cash dividends, in amounts to be determined, if it believes that our financial position, earnings, earnings outlook, capital spending plans and other relevant factors warrant such action at that time. Depending on market conditions, we may, from time to time, purchase shares of our common stock in the open market or otherwise. We did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Other Currency Risk. Some of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their operations in the local currency of the country where they conduct operations. Currency environments in which we have significant business operations include Brazil, the U.K., Australia and Mexico. When possible, we attempt to minimize our currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to our estimated operating costs payable in local currency with the balance of the contract payable in U.S. dollars. At present, however, only a limited number of our contracts are payable both in U.S. dollars and the local currency. To the extent that we are not able to cover our local currency operating costs with customer payments in the local currency, we also utilize FOREX contracts to reduce our currency exchange risk. Our FOREX contracts may obligate us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specific dates or to net settle the spread between the contracted foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date, which, for most of our contracts, is the average spot rate for the contract period. We record currency transaction gains and losses as Foreign currency transaction gain (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses arising from the settlement of our FOREX contracts that have been designated as cash flow hedges are reported as a component of Contract drilling, excluding depreciation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income, or ASU 2011 05, which eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income, or OCI, as part of the 39 Table of Contents statement of changes in stockholders equity, requires the presentation of each component of net income and each component of OCI either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements and also requires presentation of reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statement. The FASB subsequently deferred the effective date of certain provisions of this standard pertaining to the reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income, pending the issuance of further guidance on the matter. The remaining portions of ASU 2011 05 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011; however, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2011 05 will not have an effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs, or ASU 2011 04. ASU 2011 04 clarifies existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements, amends certain fair value measurement principles and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. ASU 2011 04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We will incorporate any additional disclosures in our interim and annual financial statements for the calendar year beginning January 1, 2012. Forward Looking Statements We or our representatives may, from time to time, either in this report, in periodic press releases or otherwise, make or incorporate by reference certain written or oral statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.

The risks and uncertainties included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report and our other filings with the SEC include additional factors that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial performance. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. Forward looking statements included in this report speak only as of the date of this report. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations or beliefs with regard to the statement or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward looking statement is based. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The information included in this Item 7A is considered to constitute forward looking statements for purposes of the statutory safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements in Item 7 of this report. Our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments. Market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at December 31, 2011 and 2010, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. We believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur. Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by our senior management. Senior management approves the overall investment strategy that we employ and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to us. We may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. Our investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities. We monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates. The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity. The analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period. 42 Table of Contents The sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on December 31, 2011 and 2010, due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly, the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our earnings or stockholders equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Our long term debt, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our existing debt has been issued at fixed rates, and as such, interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of $122.0 million and $117.0 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. A 100 basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of $142.4 million and $135.5 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. It is customary for us to enter into FOREX contracts in the normal course of business. These contracts generally require us to net settle the spread between the contracted foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date, which for most of our contracts is the average spot rate for the contract period. As of December 31, 2011, we had FOREX contracts outstanding in the aggregate notional amount of $154.3 million, consisting of $21.9 million in Australian dollars, $81.6 million in Brazilian reais, $25.2 million in British pounds sterling, $14.1 million in Mexican pesos and $11.5 million in Norwegian kroner. These contracts generally settle monthly through June 2012. At December 31, 2011, we have presented the fair value of our outstanding FOREX contracts as a current asset of $1.3 million in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and a current liability of $(8.5) million in Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report. We have presented the fair value of our outstanding FOREX contracts at December 31, 2010 as a current asset of $4.3 million in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and a current liability of $(0.1) million in Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this report. 43 Table of Contents The following table presents our exposure to market risk by category (interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates): Fair Value Asset (Liability) Market Risk December 31, December 31, 2011 2010 2011 2010 (In thousands) Interest rate: Marketable securities $ 902,400 (a) $ 612,300 (a) $ (4,100 ) (b) $ (1,100 ) (b) Foreign Exchange: Forward exchange contracts receivable positions 1,300 (c) 4,300 (c) (11,400 ) (d) (23,500 ) (d) Forward exchange contracts liability positions (8,500 ) (c) (100 ) (c) (14,700 ) (d) (2,100 ) (d) (a) The fair market value of our investment in marketable securities, excluding repurchase agreements, is based on the quoted closing market prices on December 31, 2011 and 2010. (b) The calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points at December 31, 2011 and 2010. (c) The fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is based on both quoted market prices and valuations derived from pricing models on December 31, 2011 and 2010. (d) The calculation of estimated foreign exchange risk assumes an instantaneous 20% decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their values at December 31, 2011 and 2010, with all other variables held constant. 44 Table of Contents
