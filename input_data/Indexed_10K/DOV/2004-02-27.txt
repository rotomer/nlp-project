ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY Sales for 2003 of $4,413.3 million were up $359.7 million or 9% from 2002, primarily driven by increases of $194.8 million at Technologies and $109.8 million at Resources. Technologies sales were impacted by recovery in the electronics industry. Resources sales increased due to improved market conditions and the acquisition of Warn Industries. Diversifieds sales increased $52.5 million, while Industries sales were essentially flat. Sales would have increased 4.6% to $4,238.1 million if 2002 foreign currency translation rates were applied to 2003 results. Acquisitions completed during 2003 contributed $67.7 million to sales and gross profit of $18.4 million. Gross profit of $1,520.4 million in 2003 represented a 14% improvement compared to $1,330.9 million in 2002. Gross profit for 2002 included approximately $12.0 million of inventory provisions primarily incurred by Technologies and to a lesser extent Diversified. Gross profit margins of 34.5% for 2003 compared to 32.8% for 2002 and were positively impacted by increased volume levels and the prior years operational realignment and restructuring. Selling and administrative expenses for 2003 were $1,076.7 million or 24% of net sales, compared to $996.2 million or 25% of net sales in 2002. Selling and administrative expenses for 2002 included approximately $28.7 million of restructuring provisions primarily incurred by Technologies and to a lesser extent Industries and Diversified. Operating profit of $443.8 million for 2003 increased $109.0 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the 9% increase in revenues, benefits from the Companys restructuring programs undertaken during 2002 and 2001 and slightly improved global economic conditions. Operating profit margin for 2003 was 10.1% compared to 8.3% for 2002. Net interest expense decreased 4% to $62.2 million for 2003, comparable to $64.8 million for 2002. The primary reasons for the decrease in net interest expense was the decrease in long term debt during the year of approximately $26 million, higher levels of interest bearing cash equivalents, in addition to interest income related to the Companys outstanding interest rate swaps on some of its long term debt. Other net expenses for 2003 were $9.7 million and primarily related to foreign exchange losses of $6.2 million and legal settlements at the Industries and Resources segments. Other expenses of $6.6 million for 2002 primarily related to foreign exchange losses of $6.0 million. The foreign exchange losses in both 2003 and 2002 primarily relate to appreciation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. Dovers effective 2003 tax rate for continuing operations was 23.3%, compared to 2002s rate of 21.1%. The low effective tax rate for both years is largely due to the continuing benefit from tax credit programs such as those for R&D combined with the benefit from U.S. export programs, lower effective foreign tax rates from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the recognition of certain capital loss benefits. Net earnings from continuing operations for 2003 were $285.2 million or $1.40 per diluted share compared to $207.8 million or $1.02 per diluted share from continuing operations in 2002. For 2003, net earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle were $292.9 million or $1.44 per diluted share, including $7.7 million or $.04 per diluted share in earnings from discontinued operations, compared to $171.8 million or $.84 per diluted share for 2002, which included $36.1 million or $.18 per diluted share in losses from discontinued operations. Discontinued operations earnings for 2003 were $7.7 million compared to losses of $36.1 million in 2002. During 2003, in connection with the completion of a federal income tax audit and commercial resolution of other issues, the Company adjusted certain reserves, established in connection with the sales of previously discontinued operations and recorded a gain on the sales of discontinued operations net of tax of $16.6 million, and additional tax benefits of $5.1 million related to losses previously incurred on sales of business. These amounts were offset by charges of $13.6 million, net of tax, to reduce discontinued businesses to their estimated fair value, and a loss on the sale of discontinued operations net of tax of $6.0 million related to contingent liabilities from previously discontinued operations. Total losses from discontinued operations in 2002 and 2001 primarily relate to charges to reduce discontinued businesses to their estimated fair value. Refer to Note 7 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 18 For 2002, the impact of the adoption of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", resulted in a net loss of $121.3 million. The adoption resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $345.1 million ($293.0 million, net of tax, or $1.44 diluted earnings per share). The adoption of the standard also discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective January 1, 2002. DIVERSIFIED TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS) Net sales.......................................... $1,168,256 $1,115,776 5% Earnings........................................... 131,867 127,454 3% Operating margins.................................. 11.3% 11.4% Bookings........................................... 1,161,012 1,082,316 7% Book to Bill....................................... 0.99 0.97 Backlog............................................ 334,349 331,234 1% Diversifieds earnings increased 3% in 2003 on a 5% sales increase, as capital equipment markets remained soft. The earnings increase was achieved mainly through operational improvements, volume and cost reduction efforts. Record segment bookings improved 7% over the prior year. Hill Phoenix, SWEP and Belvac accounted for a large portion of the earnings gain, which was somewhat offset by declines at Waukesha, Performance Motorsports, Graphics Microsystems and Crenlo. Hill Phoenix reported its second consecutive record year, setting new highs in sales, earnings and cash flow, again leading Diversified in each of these three categories. Despite its overall market being down, Hill Phoenix benefited from growth at several of its largest customers as well as securing new key accounts. Hill Phoenix has been able to outperform its competition and gain market share in recent years, due largely to industry leading product innovation and strong customer service. The improvement was across all its business units, as Display Cases, Refrigeration Systems, National Cooler and EDP all showed a year over year earnings increase. A three point operating margin improvement was achieved, largely the result of leveraging value added pricing and productivity gains. All growth over the last two years was internal, as there were no acquisitions impacting results. Growth is expected to slow somewhat in 2004, although Hill Phoenix expects to deliver another strong performance as the capital programs of its large customers are expected to remain strong. Sargents earnings were slightly down compared to the prior year, as strong military business and a successful add on acquisition were offset by the extended commercial aerospace downturn. Record bookings improved 32% over prior year, led by the Marine Division being awarded a large U.S. military order for submarine ship sets. Margins fell in 2003 largely due to an unfavorable sales mix and the decision to invest in several development programs. The Sonic business unit was hurt by continued airline cutbacks and a significant reduction in production at their largest customer. Sargent Aerospace Canada, a manufacturer of airplane components in Montreal, Canada, was acquired in April and produced positive results throughout the year. Performance Motorsports earnings declined for the first time since being acquired by Diversified in 1998, due to several production issues and a weak powersports market. Performance Motorsports struggled throughout the year integrating its December 2002 acquisition of Chambon, where volumes declined and significant losses resulted. Perfect Bore absorbed high production costs and also reported a loss, due to lingering production problems resulting from internalizing a key manufacturing process that had previously been outsourced. Performance Motorsports two largest business units, Wiseco and JE Pistons, both had steady years and reported sales and earnings slightly ahead of prior year. After four consecutive quarters of unfavorable comparisons to the prior year, Performance Motorsports saw order intake increase in the fourth quarter and earnings improved over the prior year. Despite market softness in 2003, Performance Motorsports maintained its market share and is well positioned to improve as its markets recover. 19 SWEP exceeded prior year bookings, sales, and earnings in every quarter in 2003. Though the year started slow, order activity improved in both its heat pump and boiler markets and was very strong in the last nine months of the year. Production capacity was increased with both capital investments and productivity programs to meet the growing demand. Backlog at the end of 2003 was 67% above last year. Earnings were up 60% on a 24% increase in sales, driven by cost reduction, favorable currency rates, and a robust market. Its new central warehouse in Germany was fully consolidated in 2003, which drove down lead times and reduced selling and administrative expenses. Though the price of stainless steel dropped slightly late in the year, potential increases in metal prices may affect near term margins. Belvac reported its highest earnings in five years, improving 64% over prior year. As the only independent global supplier of can forming equipment, Belvacs recent success has been in the non U.S. market, especially Russia and Australia, where can manufacturing and consumer use is growing. A significant portion of its business includes spares and retrofits that improve the productivity of its customers equipment. Further investment and advancement in its plastic container equipment is beginning to complement its can forming business, and is opening up new opportunities for growth. Belvac began the process of establishing a warehouse, service center and related supply chains in the Czech Republic, and the facility will be fully operational in 2004. Waukesha had a strong finish to the year, but still recorded a 15% earnings decline on a 6% drop in revenue. The weak power generation market continued to negatively impact the Bearings division, and costs to close its South Carolina facility further reduced earnings. This was the third time in two years that Bearings down sized its capacity due to the soft market demand. On a positive note, the Magnetics Bearing group had a record year in sales and earnings as project development work is beginning to show a payback. After a slow start to the year, the Hydratight Sweeney division had a solid comeback in the last three quarters on strong Torque and Service business. The Tension business was down for the year, though bookings in its Oil & Gas markets improved in the fourth quarter setting a good foundation for 2004. Central Research Labs sales and earnings were significantly down as orders for a number of large nuclear waste clean up projects were delayed into 2004. CRL continues to develop the use of their products with large OEMs in the pharmaceutical markets. Tranter PHE set new bookings and sales records in 2003, though earnings dropped below last year by 6%. Marine bookings came back strong especially with shipyards in South Korea. Another solid contributor was the North America ethanol market that is being driven by investments in alternative energy sources. Favorable currency translations due to the weakening of the dollar and higher Eurasian business also increased reported sales. Investments were made in the India operations to add manufacturing and engineering capability to make welded products for the Eurasia market. This facility attained the highest quality approvals for its industry in 2003 PED (Pressure Equipment Directive) for Europe and ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) for North America. Significant gains in productivity, reduced lead times and on time delivery in the Swedish manufacturing operations were also achieved. Tranter is well positioned to benefit from what seems to be a pent up demand in many of its markets. Mark Andy earnings declined 12% on slightly lower sales, as cost reduction efforts did not offset weaker gross margins. An unfavorable product mix, production start up problems on a new label press, and higher warranty expenses caused lower earnings in the St. Louis operations. Results improved at year end with fourth quarter earnings contributing over half of the years total earnings. The package printing equipment market further weakened in 2003 but began to see some firming late in the year. After a short rebound in label press orders in 2002, bookings declined 13% in 2003. Comco packaging press orders were flat in 2003, although 2003 ended with its best quarterly bookings performance since the acquisition in early 2001. Improvements in sales coverage, upgrades in sales personnel, and worldwide sales organization changes were made to strengthen its position. Both U.S. operations received ISO certification and lean manufacturing initiatives continue to drive improvement. Crenlo followed 2002s substantial turnaround with lower earnings despite slightly increased volume. Earnings were down due to an unfavorable sales mix, rising medical, natural gas and wage costs, and costs associated with projects that will generate future revenue. The unfavorable sales mix is attributable to 20 a decline in the specialty enclosure business, which has been negatively impacted by a large customers restructuring following a merger. The South Carolina facility continued to be hurt by under leveraged fixed costs and high overtime, resulting in the inability to reach consistent production levels. On a positive note, cost reductions and productivity gains achieved in 2003 have Crenlo well positioned to capitalize on higher volumes. Increased order activity in the fourth quarter by several key customers provides cautious optimism going into 2004, as shipment levels for the first quarter are projected to be higher. Graphics Microsystems (GMI) sales grew 3% over 2002, despite the third consecutive year of a decline in the printing industry. The ColorQuick product set a new sales record and has required a re alignment of its business resource and processes. GMI has decided to target large growth opportunities and has shifted its business model from only serving small to medium size printers in the aftermarket to a focus on large printers and the high end new press OEM market. 2003 earnings were negatively affected by necessary investments in R&D, price concessions, and technical service to pursue this new business. SWF completed a year of transition, reporting breakeven results as several key managers were replaced and plant consolidations were finalized. Facilities in Florida and Washington were consolidated into the California operation, resulting in overhead cost reduction and business simplification going forward. Several large warranty issues were resolved in 2003, and new warranty claims steadily declined throughout the year. Positive strides were made operationally, including the introduction of laser machining capabilities, formally establishing preferred suppliers, restructuring the sales and engineering organizations and the introduction of integrated work groups. The internal improvements achieved in 2003 will allow SWF to be more externally focused in 2004. INDUSTRIES TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS) Net sales.......................................... $1,039,930 $1,034,714 1% Earnings........................................... 121,200 137,547 (12)% Operating margins.................................. 11.7% 13.3% Bookings........................................... 1,105,046 995,552 11% Book to Bill....................................... 1.06 0.96 Backlog............................................ 201,866 119,881 68% Industries earned 12% less on essentially flat sales, reflecting plant closing costs and margin pressure from earlier in the year. Nevertheless, quarterly sales and earnings improved sequentially as the year progressed. Fourth quarter results topped the previous three quarters, reflecting market share increases and improved market conditions across the majority of companies. The biggest contributors to earnings increases were PDQ, with strong new product sales and Tipper Tie which benefited from strong overseas performance, capitalizing on the opening of the Eastern European markets. 2003 was a challenging year for Heil Environmental. Earnings were down 30% as its market declined over 20%, resulting in the lowest industry volume since 1997. Municipal markets remained weak and pricing pressures continued. Environmental closed down a facility and consolidated their two parts businesses. Performance increased in the second half, as both the third and fourth quarters showed favorable comparisons to prior year, and full year bookings and backlog were up reflecting favorable year over year comparisons. Overseas, Heil was able to leverage a strong UK market while increasing share. Rotary Lifts sales were enhanced by the May 2003 acquisition of Blitz, a German lift manufacturer. However, integrating the existing Rotary Lift Italian operations into Blitz negatively impacted earnings. North American sales fell slightly as the industry declined and competitive pressures led to contracting margins. For the full year, Rotary Lifts sales grew 5% and earnings were flat. However, a number of new products were introduced in latter half of the year, resulting in sales growth of over 8% in the second half. Backlog is up over 50%, leading to optimism heading into 2004. 21 Industry declines impacted Heil Trailer, as the U.S. tank trailer markets decreased for the fourth consecutive year. Reacting to the contraction, Trailer closed two facilities during the year. Despite continued price competition, Trailer was able to grow share in both the petroleum and dry bulk markets. Business began to pick up later in the year, as fourth quarter revenues were 16% above 2002 levels. Military shipments began in earnest in the fourth quarter, and will account for an additional $20.0 million of sales in 2004, the result of a military contract awarded to Heil in late 2003. Kalyn Siebert, a Heil Trailer subsidiary, benefited from this strong military volume as revenues almost doubled for the year. Tipper Ties European operations achieved record sales driven by strong performance in Eastern Europe. Earnings improved 21% on a sales increase of 9%. Alpina, a 2000 acquisition, surpassed last years record results as they continue to expand their product line into new geographic regions. The U.S. business continues to be challenged amid a weak capital equipment market and continued pricing pressure. However, the declines witnessed last year have been stemmed and a rebound is expected in 2004. Marathons sales and margins declined three percentage points in 2003 which were primarily the result of pricing pressures driven by market weakness. The waste equipment market was down, adjusting to the overcapacity of production in the industry, ultimately leading to price erosion. As a result, Marathon closed a facility while reducing headcount by over 10%. Strength in their Recycling Systems Group helped stem the tide, and will be a key growth area in 2004. Triton, which saw significant improvement in 2002, delivered record revenues in 2003, although earnings were relatively flat because of new product start up costs. Unit sales were up over 10% in a flat U.S. market, resulting in share gains again in 2003. These gains were attributable to the success of the 9100 product line, which was introduced mid 2002 and focuses on the broadest segment of the cash dispenser market. It now represents more than two thirds of 2003 unit sales volume. Their strong new product focus continued in 2003, as two key products were introduced late in the year. The FT5000 is a through the wall model aimed at the financial institution market, while the RL5000 is aimed principally at the retail market. Internationally, both the UK and Canadian markets remained strong, and market share increased in both of these key focus regions. Triton expects to enter additional countries in 2004, as international markets currently account for approximately 35% of unit sales. PDQs record fourth quarter results contributed to solid year over year gains. Earnings increased 22% while sales increased 12%. An increase in major oil and gas station business coupled with continued strong investor demand drove the late year surge. Market share continues to increase, although competitors are beginning to have an impact on the low end market. A major driver in 2002 was the introduction and customer acceptance of several new products, one of which, a higher end Laser Wash, accounted for over 30% of sales in the fourth quarter. Declining tax revenues for most states, counties and municipalities led to a slowdown in DI Foodservices institutional foodservice equipment market, continuing a trend which began last year. However, both Groen and Randell were able to grow market share during the year. There has been a pickup in chain restaurant sales, as many experienced strong same store sales growth in the later half of the year. Institutional markets will continue to struggle, although renovation and replacements have shown some growth in 2003 and are expected to continue into 2004. Consolidation costs experienced in 2003 to bring the Groen, Randell, and Avtec businesses under the DI Foodservice umbrella, will positively impact margins in 2004. Kurz Kasch rebounded from a challenging 2002 as revenues and earnings increased over 10% driven by the successful integration of business/product lines acquired in late 2002. In addition, Kurz Kasch purchased Wabash Magnetics, a manufacturer of actuators and sensors, in December of 2003. This acquisition will allow Kurz Kasch to expand into the medical and irrigation markets, among others. Dovatechs performance benefited from strength in both the Chiller and Laser businesses. A pickup in semiconductor demand drove the Laser business performance while strong sales into the medical market resulted in the Chiller business growing over 18%. Strength in Chief Automotives computerized measuring products was more than offset by market contraction in the frame straightening market. Somero partially 22 offset significant market weakness with the successful introduction of the "Copperhead", a walk behind laser screed, which now accounts for over 60% of unit sales. RESOURCES TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS) Net sales............................................. $982,658 $872,898 13% Earnings.............................................. 136,851 124,380 10% Operating margins..................................... 13.9% 14.2% Bookings.............................................. 990,057 867,155 14% Book to Bill.......................................... 1.01 0.99 Backlog............................................... 104,362 70,876 47% Resources 2003 earnings increased by 10% on a sales increase of 13% due to strong increases from the Energy Products Group, De Sta Co Industries and the OPW companies, and the acquisition of Warn Industries. All twelve Resources companies increased bookings versus 2002 and ended the year with slightly higher backlogs overall. Warn, which was acquired on October 1, 2003, was a significant driver of Resources revenue and earnings growth, even after the impact of purchase accounting. Warn is a leader in the recreational winch business, both for all terrain vehicles and four wheel drive vehicles. In addition, Warn is a leading manufacturer of all wheel drive and four wheel drive disconnect technology providing products that enhance fuel economy and improve performance of these vehicles. The continued flow of new products and the entrance into new markets should drive continued growth in the business. The Energy Products Group results include Quartzdyne, which was added to the group in 2003. Overall, the year was extremely positive with an earnings increase of 41% on a sales increase of 15% great operating leverage. The core products of Alberta Oil Tool and Norris achieved sales and margin increases, both domestically and globally. Both of these units had record profits. Ferguson Beauregard and Norriseal had greatly improved earnings on relatively small increases in sales. Quartzdyne was the exception in the group. While continuing to achieve very respectable earnings, Quartzdyne did not benefit from increased activity in the energy sector. However, they did not experience any loss of market share and the company continued to invest in new products to allow expansion of its served markets. OPW Fueling Components had a very strong year leveraging earnings 35% on a sales increase of 8%. OPW achieved solid business growth from its "newly certified" products for compliance with the "Enhanced Vapor Recovery" requirements. In addition, the business continued to rationalize capacity in North America, while at the same time opening a new facility in China and expanding its presence in Brazil with the opening of a larger manufacturing facility. Significant benefits were achieved from global sourcing and expansion of a well disciplined Six Sigma quality initiative. The full integration of the EMCO Electronics acquisition into the OPW Fuel Management business was completed in 2003 and drove an earnings increase in that business unit. De Sta Co Industries increased earnings 23% on a sales increase of 16%. Continued focus on new product development, internal lean initiatives, and improvements in channel management provided very positive results. The German and French operations achieved significant improvement in earnings. The increased strength in the Industrial Products Group offset weakness in the electronics and U.S. automotive business segments. The pump companies, Blackmer and Wilden, experienced a number of challenges, including a legal settlement and costs incurred to restructure product lines, in 2003 that impacted earnings, although both companies made strides to improve their product offering and grow their business on a global basis. Wildens non U.S. sales grew 20% and were enhanced by the opening of a manufacturing facility in China, which exceeded first year plan results, and growth in their Argentina operation as that economy began to recover. 23 Blackmer had its strongest year ever in Europe but experienced costs in the U.S. to rationalize capacity and "right size" its U.S. operations. OPW Fluid Transfer Group had a year of solid improvement across all its business units with earnings increasing 16% on a sales increase of 8%. Improvements in working capital contributed to a higher return on investment. Strong results from Midland and Europe were the drivers to better results. The global footprint for this business was expanded in 2003 with the addition of a facility in Brazil and finalization of a restructuring in Europe. C. Lee Cook benefited from right sizing in 2002, as well as from a number of management led initiatives to reduce product cost, and expand its service presence. The business achieved positive earnings leverage of 15% on a modest sales increase of 4%. As the year 2003 ended, C. Lee Cook experienced improvements across all of its business units both OEM related and service related. This increase indicates continued investment in natural gas production and transmission. With demand for natural gas increasing, the Company anticipates strength in the business going forward. Texas Hydraulics experienced a challenging year as a result of continued price pressure and reduced schedules from construction equipment customers. During 2003, the business made significant investments in new products and new customer applications/prototypes. As the year of 2003 closed, orders resulting from new products were strong. The business continues to implement lean concepts and selective outsourcing to improve its cost structures. Tulsa Winch was able to grow earnings 6% on a sales increase of 9%. There was very little consistency across market segments, with difficult conditions in the large crane and service crane markets being offset by strength in the petroleum, military, and marine segments. Continued efforts to leverage strengths across the group are leading to advanced new product offerings that will be introduced in 2004. RPA Process Technologies experienced an extremely difficult year in 2003 with declining revenues and a full year loss resulting from depressed capital spending in the process industry coupled with significant one time charges to downsize its operations in France. Hydro Systems experienced relatively flat sales in its traditional core U.S. business but was still able to achieve a 4% earnings gain on a 5% sales increase, primarily as a result of prior investments in new products and Europe. The European operations more than doubled earnings as a result of some very successful new product launches. Hydro also invested in the start up of a new facility in Brazil, which began operations during the fourth quarter of 2003 and will provide full year benefits in 2004. TECHNOLOGIES TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS) Net sales.......................................... $1,231,241 $1,036,472 19% Segment earnings (losses).......................... 84,763 (30,339) Operating margins.................................. 6.9% (2.9)% Bookings........................................... 1,275,598 1,046,903 22% Book to Bill....................................... 1.04 1.01 Backlog............................................ 182,427 127,752 43% Technologies sales increased to $1,231.2 million, a 19% increase over 2002. As a result of both the restructuring commenced in the fourth quarter of 2002 and increased revenues, earnings increased to $84.8 million, a $115.1 million improvement from a loss in 2002 of $30.3 million. Included in the loss for 2002 were restructuring, inventory and other charges totaling $35.2 million. The electronics industry is clearly in a recovery mode with even the telecom sector showing signs of increased equipment spending. As electronic manufacturing continues to shift to Asia, almost all of the Technologies companies have improved their Asian infrastructure in sales and marketing and, at the equipment companies, in manufacturing. 24 In addition, all of the companies continued their efforts to expand their product offering in the markets and applications they serve. Military, space, avionics, medical, automotive and other industrial applications played a greater role in 2003 than in 2002 in the Technologies businesses. CIRCUIT BOARD ASSEMBLY AND TEST (CBAT) TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS) Net sales............................................. $731,749 $598,646 22% Segment earnings (losses)............................. 43,691 (55,722) Operating margins..................................... 6.0% (9.3)% Bookings.............................................. 760,923 615,522 24% Book to Bill.......................................... 1.04 1.03 Backlog............................................... 107,036 72,166 48% Technologies CBAT businesses reported earnings of $43.7 million for the year versus a loss of $55.7 million in 2002. The 2002 loss included inventory, restructuring and other charges of $25.9 million. Sales increased 22% to $731.8 million while bookings increased 24% to $760.9 million. Much of this growth came from the back end semiconductor businesses, ECT and Alphasem, whose sales grew from 16% of CBAT sales in 2002 to over 22% in 2003. Universal Instruments saw a 17% increase in sales over 2002 and recorded a profit for the first time since 2000. Universal continues to invest in new products which were recently exhibited at the November Productronica show in Germany. Universal will face significant challenges in 2003 transitioning to these new products, and bringing them to full commercialization in the second half of 2004. While sales at Everett Charles Technologies increased 18%, profits increased dramatically with double digit margins, after reporting a loss in 2002. The largest increase in sales occurred in the back end semiconductor test products. The test handling equipment at MultiTest and the load board and socket products at ECT reported the largest increase in sales and bookings activity. This trend is expected to continue into the beginning of 2004. DEK experienced a 26% increase in sales and reported a profit for 2003. The weakening dollar impacted DEKs gross margin as much of its manufacturing remains in the UK, while sales are generally sold in U.S. dollar or U.S. dollar linked currencies. The 2002 acquisition of Acumen has now been integrated and has provided increased levels of non machine recurring revenues. OK International reported a slight increase in sales of 4% which generated positive earnings compared to a loss in 2002. Earnings were slightly positive compared to a loss in prior years. During 2003, OK completely restructured its domestic operations by consolidating the majority of its manufacturing into a single plant in southern California. Vitronics Soltec reported a 39% increase in sales and also had a profit versus a loss in 2002. Its new products in selective soldering and its "lead free" solder knowledge leadership helped Vitronics continue to gain market share against its competitors. Alphasem reported a 103% increase in sales and positive earnings in 2003, in contrast to a loss in 2002. Alphasem serves the back end semiconductor business with die bonding equipment. Under a new President, Alphasem has restructured the companys management team, its R&D efforts, Asian sales force and logistics, and established a Chinese manufacturing organization. These efforts have had a significant impact on the improved financial results of the Company. Hover Davis, acquired in October of 2002, saw sales increase 14% on a year over year basis. Though financial performance improved over 2002, Hover Davis reported a small loss in 2003, as markets served have still not fully recovered. 25 SPECIALTY ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS (SEC) TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS) Net sales............................................. $211,575 $205,635 3% Segment earnings (losses)............................. 7,316 (12,070) Operating margins..................................... 3.5% (5.9)% Bookings.............................................. 221,145 199,255 11% Book to Bill.......................................... 1.05 0.97 Backlog............................................... 53,074 42,740 24% In Technologies SEC companies, sales increased 3% over 2002, to $211.6 million. Earnings improved significantly to $7.3 million when compared to a loss of $12.1 million last year. The 2002 loss included inventory, restructuring and other charges of $9.9 million. Substantially all of this earnings growth came in the fourth quarter as the first three quarters were basically flat on a year to year comparison. During 2003, the SEC companies made considerable efforts to expand their customer base and industries served. Telecom products were a lesser portion of the overall businesses as military, space, avionics, medical, automotive and other industrial applications grew as a percent of sales. Towards the end of 2003, even telecom customers increased their spending with indications that this trend will continue into 2004. Vectron (formerly referred to as Quadrant), the largest of the SEC companies, reported an increase in sales of 5% for the year, but 23% for the fourth quarter alone. Margins improved to 10% in the fourth quarter. Earnings for the year improved by $17.4 million from a loss in 2002. Vectron continues to acquire new customers based on its technology, service and quality. K&L Microwave spent most of 2003 refocusing its business on military and industrial markets. As its base station customers consolidated their supply chains, K&L found much of its planned Asian telecom infrastructure business had diminished. Accordingly, K&L has exited all Asian manufacturing, leaving in place a sales and marketing team to respond to appropriate opportunities. This realignment of its business resulted in a loss for K&L for 2003. The capacitor companies, Novacap and Dielectric, both reported increased sales, 17% and 4%, respectively. Operating margins increased to 13% and 9%, respectively. Both companies continued their efforts at developing hi reliability and hi frequency applications for their customers. Dow Key continued to be profitable on flat sales. Dow Key serves primarily the military, space and industrial markets, which have not been as volatile as the telecom industry. MARKING AND CODING Imaje, the French based industrial marking and coding Company, reported full year sales of $287.9 million, an increase of 24%, and earnings of almost $60 million, an increase of 21%. Imaje had historically relied on its continuous ink jet small character printer and related ink as its primary products. During the past two years, Imaje, through acquisitions, has acquired "drop on demand" large character printer and thermal printer technologies. During 2003, products related to these new capabilities grew to 21% of equipment sales, from 17% in 2002, while at the same time, ink jet unit sales grew 17% year over year. Imaje has a strong global presence. Sales for 2003, as compared to 2002, were enhanced by a 20% strengthening of the Euro against the dollar. However, margins continue to be pressured as the majority of Imajes product costs are incurred in Euros while significant amounts of revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars. Consequently, Imaje is in the process of expanding its production and delivery platform in both China and North America. These efforts should be accomplished by mid 2004. 26 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in the external disclosures of the Company including information regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. The Company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conform to GAAP and are consistently applied. Valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the Company. Primary areas where the financial information of Dover is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions and the application of judgment include the following: Revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following circumstances are satisfied, a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectibility is reasonably assured and d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving non essential installation obligations are those which can generally be completed in a short period of time, at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to the Company and in many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered product, revenues are deferred until installation is complete. In a limited number of revenue transactions, other post shipment obligations such as training and customer acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenues are deferred until the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance has been confirmed. Service revenues are recognized and earned when services are performed and are not significant to any period presented. Allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances. Estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses, adjusting for current economic conditions and, in some cases, evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. The establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances. Though Dover considers these balances adequate and proper, changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the Company operates could have a material effect on reserve balances required. In times of rapid market decline, such as affected a number of Technologies companies in 2001 and 2002, reserve balances needed to be adjusted in response to these unusual circumstances. Inventory for the majority of the Companys subsidiaries, including all international subsidiaries and the Technologies segment, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first in, first out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is stated at cost, determined on the last in, first out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the Company to properly value inventory. Technologies companies tend to experience higher levels of inventory value fluctuations, particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time. Occasionally, the Company will establish restructuring reserves at an operation. These reserves, for both severance and exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though Dover believes that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of these plans, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts. Dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines (including SFAS No. 142) for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the identification of Reporting Units and the determination of fair market value. Dovers assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when there is a significant change in circumstances. The Company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply 27 with generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to these valuations. The valuation of Dovers pension and other post retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets/liabilities. These assumptions include discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used in Dovers pension reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to assure that they accurately account for Dovers future pension obligations. Changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on Dovers pension expenses and related funding requirements. Dovers expected long term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns and portfolio allocation. Dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal, state and international issues that are currently unresolved. The Company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved. Valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes to tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates and the Companys future taxable income levels. Dover has significant accruals and reserves related to its risk management program. These accruals require the use of estimates and judgment in regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability. The Company estimates losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions, Dover experience, and relevant industry data. Dover considers the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and Company experience. Dover has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both the operating company and corporate levels. A significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify Dovers ultimate exposure in these matters. The valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to assure that Dover is properly reserved. Reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues. While Dover believes that the current level of reserves is adequate, changes in the future could impact these determinations. The Company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust if necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair value less costs to sell. These estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale. The adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Management assesses the Companys liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, adequacy of commercial paper and available bank lines of credit and the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position, with enough liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing the capital structure on a short and long term basis. 28 The following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, CASH FLOWS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS 2003 2002 (IN THOUSANDS) Cash flows provided by operating activities................. $ 593,666 $ 357,144 Cash flows (used in) investing activities................... (448,600) (179,451) Cash flows (used in) financing activities................... (98,281) (140,070) Cash flow provided from operating activities during 2003 was $236.5 million higher than 2002. Increases in cash flows from operations were primarily driven by increased net earnings of $77.4 million and tax refunds of $151.5 million. Cash used in investing activities for 2003 rose $269.1 million from the prior year, reflecting an increase in acquisition activity from the prior year. The acquisition expenditures for 2003 were $362.1 million compared to $99.7 million in 2002. Acquisitions expenditures during 2003 were primarily related to the purchase of Warn for $326.0 million. The Company expects that 2004 acquisition activity will be consistent with the 2003 level but will depend largely upon the availability and pricing of appropriate acquisition candidates. Capital expenditures were essentially flat at $96.4 million for both 2003 and 2002. Capital expenditures during 2003 and 2002 were funded by internal cash flow. Capital expenditures for 2004 are expected to increase slightly over 2003 levels. Cash used in financing activities during 2003 was down $41.8 million compared to 2002. Dividends paid of $115.5 million was the primary use of the cash, offset by a net increase in debt of $13.5 million. Cash used in financing activities during 2002 primarily reflected a net $21.5 million decrease of debt and dividend payments of $109.4 million. During 2003, Dover repaid approximately $26.4 million of long term debt and had $40.0 million of commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2003. In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow, the Company also measures free cash flow. Management believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions and repay debt. Dovers free cash flow for 2003 increased significantly as cash generated from operations improved $236.5 million from 2002. The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow with cash flows from operating activities: TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, FREE CASH FLOW 2003 2002 (IN THOUSANDS) Cash flow provided by operating activities.................. $ 593,666 $ 357,144 Less: Capital expenditures...................................... (96,400) (96,417) Dividends to stockholders................................. (115,504) (109,436) Free cash flow.............................................. $ 381,762 $ 151,291 The Companys cash and cash equivalents increased 26% during 2003 to $370.4 million at December 31, 2003, compared to $293.8 million at December 31, 2002. Working capital (calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) increased from December 31, 2002 by $103.8 million or 10.1% to $1,024.2 million, primarily driven by increases in receivables of $105.7 million to $747.6 million and increases in inventory of $65.8 million to $639.3 million, offset by increases in payables of $67.7 million to $258.9 million. Excluding the impact of acquisitions on working capital of $58.9 million and changes in foreign currency of $60.7 million, working capital decreased by $15.8 million or 2% from December 31, 2002. Increases in receivables were driven by acquisitions of 29 $33.2 million, increases due to foreign currency fluctuations of $56.2 million and increased sales activity. Inventory balances increases were driven by acquisitions of $38.5 million, increases due to foreign currency fluctuations of $32.1 million and decreases due to operational efforts to reduce inventory on hand. Increases in accounts payable were driven by acquisitions of $12.7 million, foreign currency fluctuations of $27.6 million and a concerted effort by management to better align the payable cycle with the Companys cash receipts cycle. Other assets and deferred charges increased $40.6 million to $208.1 million at December 31, 2003. Increases were primarily due to increased pre paid pension assets resulting from $48.5 million of contributions made during 2003. At December 31, 2003, the Companys net property, plant, and equipment amounted to $717.9 million compared with $676.2 million at the end of the preceding year. The increase in net property, plant and equipment reflected acquisitions of $64.0 million, capital expenditures of $96.4 million and increases related to foreign currency fluctuation of $26.5 million, offset by depreciation. Goodwill and intangible assets increased $216.8 million and $146.9 million, respectively. Increases were primarily driven by acquisitions which resulted in goodwill of $184.9 million and intangible assets of $149.5 million and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of $68.9 million, offset by amortization. The aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities increased from $152.0 million at the beginning of the year to $330.8 million at year end. This resulted primarily from the increase in deferrals related to intangible assets, the federal tax refund of $151.5 million and increase in taxable income during 2003. Current accrued expenses increased $66.0 million to $446.8 million at December 31, 2003. Increases during 2003 related to increased accrued compensation and employee benefits of $20.7 million, increased insurance accruals of $19.2 million and increases in other accrued expenses of $26.2 million. Retained earnings increased from $3,164.6 million at the beginning of 2003 to $3,342.0 million at December 31, 2003. The $177.4 million increase resulted from 2003 net earnings of $292.9 million, reduced by cash dividends which aggregated $115.5 million. Stockholders equity increased from $2,394.8 million to $2,742.7 million. The $347.9 million increase resulted mainly from the increase in retained earnings and increased equity adjustments related to foreign currency translation of $157.9 million. Dovers consolidated pension benefit obligation increased by $100.9 million in 2003. The increase was due principally to increases in actuarial losses related to decreases in the discount rate. In addition, plan assets increased $76.2 million due to gains on plan investments during the year and contributions of $48.5 million. During 2003, plan amendments created an increase in the benefit obligation of $27.0 million. Due to the decrease in the net funded status of the plans and the amortization of unrecognized losses, it is estimated that pension expense will increase to approximately $16.1 million in 2004. The Company anticipates making discretionary contributions to its pension benefit plans of $15 million to $25 million in 2004. The Company utilizes the total debt and net debt to total capitalization calculations to assess its overall financial leverage and believes the calculations are useful to its stakeholders for the same reasons. The total debt level of $1,067.6 million as of December 31, 2003 increased $13.5 million from December 31, 2002 as a result of drawing down approximately $40.0 million of short term commercial paper, partially offset by repayment of $26.4 million of long term debt. As of December 31, 2003, net debt of $696.2 million represented 20.2% of total capital, a decrease of 3.9 percentage points from December 31, 2002. During 2003, Dover borrowed $175 million in commercial paper to fund the acquisition of Warn, which was then paid down in the same period with tax refunds of approximately $151.5 million. 30 The following table reconciles net debt and net debt to total capitalization: TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, NET DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION RATIO 2003 2002 (IN THOUSANDS) Short term debt and commercial paper........................ $ 63,669 $ 23,761 Long term debt.............................................. 1,003,915 1,030,299 Less: Cash, equivalents and marketable securities........... 371,397 294,335 Net debt.................................................... 696,187 759,725 Add: Stockholders equity................................... 2,742,671 2,394,834 Total capitalization........................................ $3,438,858 $3,154,559 Net debt to total capitalization............................ 20.2% 24.1% The Company has access to $600 million of bank credit facilities. The arrangements include a $300 million 364 day Credit Agreement (dated October 2003, which replaced the prior 364 day credit agreement dated October 2002) and a $300 million 3 year credit agreement (dated October 2002). The new 364 day facility bears interest at Libor plus .23% and the 3 year facility bears interest at LIBOR plus .21%. The key financial covenant of these facilities requires the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to net interest expense of not less than 3.5 to 1. The Company has been in compliance with the covenant and the ratio was 9.4 to 1 as of December 31, 2003 and 7.8 to 1 as of December 31, 2002. These credit facilities were unused during 2003 and 2002. The Company intends to replace both the $300 million 3 year and 364 day facilities on or before their expiration dates of October 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company established a Canadian Credit Facility in November of 2002. Under the terms of this Credit Agreement, the Company has a Canadian (CAD) $30 million bank credit availability and has the option to borrow in either Canadian Dollars or U.S. Dollars. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the outstanding borrowings under this facility were approximately $16 million in U.S. dollars. The covenants and interest rates under this facility match those of the primary $600 million Revolving Credit Facilities. The Canadian Credit Facility was renewed for an additional year prior to its expiration date of November 25, 2003 and now expires on November 25, 2004. The Company intends to replace the Canadian Credit Facility on or before its expiration date. The primary purpose of these agreements is to act as an alternative for short term financing in the event of a disruption in the commercial paper market which the Company normally accesses for its short term borrowing needs. The Company may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes. Interest rate swaps are agreements to exchange fixed and variable rate payments based on the notional principal amounts. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has three interest rate swap agreements terminating on June 1, 2008 with a total notional amount of $150 million to exchange fixed rate interest for variable. All three swaps were designated as fair value hedges of the $150 million 6.25% Notes, due June 1, 2008, and the interest payments or receipts from these agreements, during 2003, were recorded as adjustments to interest expense. There was no hedge ineffectiveness as of December 31, 2003 and the aggregate fair value interest rate swaps determined through market quotation of $1.7 million was reported in other assets and long term debt. Subsequent to December 31, 2003, one interest rate swap with a notional amount of $50.0 million was terminated with no material impact to the Company. During 2002, Dover settled two interest rate swaps, which resulted in net gains of $8.4 million. These gains were deferred and are being amortized over the balance of the term of the debt, permanently reducing the effective interest rate of the $250 million Notes, due November 15, 2005 from 6.5% to 5.3%. Dovers long term debt instruments with a book value of $1,003.9 million on December 31, 2003 had a fair value of approximately $1,103.0 million. For the year ending December 31, 2002, the Companys long term debt instruments approximated their fair value. Management is not aware of any potential impairment to the Companys liquidity, and the Company was in compliance with all its long term debt covenants. It is anticipated that in 2004 any funding requirements 31 above cash generated from operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper or, depending upon market conditions, through the issuance of long term debt or some combination of the two. The Companys credit ratings are as follows for the years ended December 31: 2003 2002 SHORT TERM LONG TERM SHORT TERM LONG TERM Moodys.................................. P 1 A1 P 1 A1 Standard & Poors........................ A 1 A+ A 1 A+ Fitch....................................

Acquisition spending would increase company debt but management anticipates that the debt to capital ratio will remain generally consistent with historical levels. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the Companys various cash flow requirements, including acquisition spending and pension funding as needed. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities", which is effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The standard replaces EITF Issue 94 3 and requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred, as defined in SFAS No. 146, rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The provisions of SFAS 146 are to be applied prospectively. The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 146 was immaterial to the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. In November of 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34." FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of FASB Statement No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies", relating to the guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after December 15, 2002 and have been incorporated into the footnotes. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantors year end. FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. The effect of the adoption of FIN 45 was immaterial to the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. The Company has also adopted the disclosure requirements of FIN 45. In December of 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of SFAS 123" which is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 regarding certain disclosure requirements which have been incorporated into the footnotes. This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. It also amends the disclosure provisions of that Statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entitys accounting 32 policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation. Finally, this Statement amends APB Opinion No. 28, "Interim Financial Reporting", to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 148 had no impact to the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. In January 2003, FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" was issued. FIN 46 provides guidance on consolidating variable interest entities and applies immediately to variable interests created after January 31, 2003. In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board revised and superseded FIN 46 with the issuance of FIN 46R in order to address certain implementation issues which will be adopted the first reporting period ending after March 15, 2004. The interpretation requires variable interest entities to be consolidated if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit an entity to finance its activities without support from other parties or the equity investors lack certain specified characteristics. The effect of the adoption of FIN 46 was immaterial to the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. In May 2003 the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity". SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 applies specifically to a number of financial instruments that companies have historically presented within their financial statements either as equity or between the liabilities section and the equity section, rather than as liabilities. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 150 was immaterial to the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission issues Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (SAB 104), Revenue Recognition. SAB 104 supersedes SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements to include the guidance from Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 00 21 "Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables." The adoption of SAB 104 did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2003, the FASB published a revision to SFAS No. 132 "Employers Disclosure about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106". SFAS No. 132R requires additional disclosures to those in the original SFAS No. 132 about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. The provisions of SFAS No. 132 remain in effect until the provisions of SFAS No. 132R are adopted. SFAS No. 132R is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 132R did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. 2002 COMPARED WITH 2001 SUMMARY Dover had net earnings from continuing operations for 2002 of $207.8 million or $1.02 diluted earnings per share (DEPS) compared to $178.2 million or $.87 DEPS from continuing operations in 2001. Earnings from continuing operations (net of tax) included inventory, restructuring and other charges of $25.3 million or $.12 DEPS in 2002 and $52.6 million or $.26 DEPS in 2001. For 2002, net earnings before changes in accounting principles were $171.8 million or $.84 DEPS, including $36.1 million or $.18 DEPS in losses from discontinued operations, compared to $248.5 million or $1.22 DEPS in 2001 which included $70.3 million or $.34 DEPS in earnings from discontinued operations which was primarily the result of gains from the sale of AC Compressor and DovaTech businesses. For 2002, the net loss was $121.3 million or $.60 DEPS compared to earnings of $248.5 million or $1.22 DEPS in 2001. 2002 results include the impact of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). The adoption resulted in a goodwill 33 impairment charge of $345.1 million ($293.0 million net of tax or $1.44 DEPS) which was recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2002. The adoption of SFAS 142 also included the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill, effective January 1, 2002. Goodwill amortization, adjusted for discontinued operations, totaled $42.2 million net of tax or $.21 DEPS for 2001. Sales for 2002 were $4,053.6 million compared to $4,223.2 million last year, a decrease of 4%. Gross profit of $1,330.9 million for the year 2002 was down 2% compared to the 2001 amount of $1,353.5 million. This decline was primarily due to the impact on Dover Technologies of the market contraction in demand for its products serving the electronics industry. At the same time, many of the industrial businesses in the other three operating segments were negatively impacted by the slowdown in general economic activity. However, the gross profit margin of 33% for 2002 compared favorably to 32% in 2001. Operating profit of $334.7 million improved 7% compared to $313.9 million in 2001. As a percentage of sales, operating profit in 2002 was 8% compared to 7% in 2001. Comparisons to 2001 benefited from the discontinuation of goodwill amortization in accordance with SFAS 142. Segment earnings of $359.0 million improved 1% from $354.9 million in 2001. Diversifieds earnings of $127.5 million improved 44% compared to 2001 on a 10% sales increase to $1,115.8 million. In the Industries segment earnings increased 3% to $137.6 million on a 2% sales decline to $1,034.7 million. Resources earnings declined 2% to $124.4 million on an 8% sales decrease to $872.9 million. In the Technologies segment a loss for 2002 of $30.3 million compared to 2001 earnings of $5.6 million, and reflected a 13% sales decline to $1,036.5 million. For 2002, Diversified had margins of 11%, up two points and Industries produced margins of 13%, which remained unchanged from 2001. Resources margins improved one percentage point to 14%. Technologies negative margins of 3% compared to break even margins in 2001. Dovers tax rate for continuing operations was 21.1% for 2002 and 29.5% in 2001. The lower effective tax rate in 2002 was attributable to three factors. First, the Company continued to benefit from tax credit programs such as those for Research and Development and foreign taxes. Second, the Company also continued to benefit from tax incentive programs relating to export sales. Third, the Company implemented a reorganization of various entities which permitted the Company to identify and recognize tax benefits related to adverse market conditions and the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 142. Interest expense of $69.9 million for the year ended 2002 was down 23% compared to 2001 primarily due to lower levels of commercial paper borrowings throughout 2002. Interest income declined in 2002 compared to 2001, which included $5.0 million related to a U.S. Federal tax settlement. All other net income or expense declined $20.8 million for 2002 compared to the prior year total, which included an insurance recovery of $6.4 million in the Diversified segment. Foreign exchange losses of $6.0 million for 2002 compared to gains of $1.7 million in 2001. 2002 losses were due to unfavorable exchange rate movements primarily involving the Euro. DIVERSIFIED Diversifieds earnings increased 44% in 2002 to $127.5 million on a 10% sales increase to $1,115.8 million. Implementation of lean initiatives, operational improvements, and cost reduction efforts helped the earnings increase, as well the absence of $18.1 million in restructuring, inventory, and other charges taken in 2001. The impact of goodwill amortization on earnings for the full year 2001 was $14.4 million. Segment profit margins improved to 11% from 9%. A significant turnaround at Crenlo, strong earnings growth at Hill Phoenix, and PMI gains accounted for a large portion of the earnings improvement, which were somewhat offset by declines at SWF, L&E, Tranter, Mark Andy, Waukesha, and Sargent. Hill Phoenixs financial performance improved significantly in 2002, setting new records in sales, earnings, and cash flow, leading Diversified in each of these three categories. This was accomplished through ongoing market share gain in recent years and benefiting from their largest customers continuing expansion programs. Market share improved to 18% in 2002 from 14% in 2001. This growth was the result of being well positioned with the fastest growing customers as well as securing new key accounts. Aggressive cost reduction 34 initiatives at the Refrigeration Division were a major contributor to the companys margin improvement in 2002. Sargents 2002 earnings were down consistent with an increase in sales volume. The weakened commercial aircraft market negatively impacted the companys core business, offset somewhat by the Marine Divisions record earnings year fueled by an active military market. Margins fell in 2002 due largely to a shift in product mix and lower volume. The Sonic business was depressed by airline losses and a 28% reduction in production at their largest customer. Performance Motorsports (PMI) achieved their sixth consecutive record year in sales and earnings. This accomplishment was made in spite of a weak fourth quarter, as their usual pickup in advance of the 2002 racing season did not occur. Also, the last few years of mild winters in the Midwest hurt their seasonal sales of pistons to the snowmobile market. Investments were made in the U.K. in both a European sales office and a new Technology Center to promote and market their products in this key region of the racing world. Successful integration of past acquisitions has positioned Performance Motorsports well in the market, increasing product offerings and strengthening their distribution channels. In late December 2002, PMI acquired Chambon S.A. of St. Etienne, France, a manufacturer of premium crankshafts for the Formula 1 market. The addition of Chambon gives Performance Motorsports the ability to offer a complete rotating assembly to the engine market. Tranter ended 2002 with a weak fourth quarter that left earnings and margins below 2001, despite a record sales and bookings year. Tranter is highly dependent on industrial capital spending, which remained weak in 2002. After years of stable margins, 2002 and 2001 have seen significant margin erosion. A soft U.S. and European economy reduced total orders in the marketplace, and led to stronger price competition for the orders that were available. Tranters three business units, SWEP, Tranter Radiator, and Tranter PHE, were reported as independent operating companies of Diversified in 2002. Belvac ended 2002 on a positive trend resulting in their highest annual bookings in five years. As the only independent global supplier of can forming equipment, Belvacs recent success has been in the international market, especially Russia and Eastern Europe, where can manufacturing and consumer demand is growing. A significant part of their business includes spares and retrofits that improve the productivity of their customers equipment. Belvac is well known for their proprietary technology, which provides them with a strong position in the market. Further investment and advancement in their plastic container equipment is beginning to complement their can forming business, and is opening up new opportunities for growth. Waukesha Bearings earnings decline of 10% was caused by the collapse of the power generation market for large bearing products. Backlog at year end 2002 was significantly down due to low bookings and cancelled orders throughout the year from key customers. Waukeshas two other divisions, Hydratight Sweeney and Central Research Labs, both had modest sales and earnings increases as their markets, oil/gas and nuclear waste cleanup, remained fairly stable throughout 2002. In response to the bearing market decline, the Bearings division shutdown one small facility in the U.K. and consolidated their large bearing production into one plant in the U.S., resulting in a 25% headcount reduction. Mark Andys printing equipment market continued to be weak for most of 2002 and operational earnings decreased. Sales were higher than 2001 due mainly to having a full years impact of the March 2001 acquisition of Comco. Improved integration of the Comco product line was a focus in 2002, as a new sales organization was introduced and was successful in gaining orders late in the year. The printing market improved slightly in late 2002, allowing bookings and backlog for label presses in the U.S. to improve in the fourth quarter. After three years of declining sales and earnings, new management and improved processes/products at Van Dam in the Netherlands resulted in increased earnings in 2002. The Graphics Microsystems (GMI) division secured preferred partner status with a large press supplier in 2002, as well having their products selected as the standard platform for the future by two of the worlds largest printing companies. The Mark Andy structure changed in 2002 as Graphics Microsystems was reported as a separate Diversified operating company. 35 Crenlo achieved a significant earnings improvement in 2002, turning sizable 2001 losses into a modest profit. The focus at Crenlo in 2002 was a return to profitability through lean manufacturing initiatives, resulting in reduced headcount and improvements in productivity and first pass yield. Cost reduction efforts in the material acquisition area, including value engineering efforts, resulted in savings of over $2 million. Additionally, the inventory reserves taken in 2001 were not repeated in 2002. These cost saving programs fueled the significant earnings improvement with little additional sales volume. SWF had a disappointing 2002 as restructuring costs related to plant consolidations and product rationalization were incurred, in addition to high warranty expense to correct a number of large equipment projects. The weak packaging machinery market continued throughout 2002, and sales for SWF decreased when compared to 2001. Improved project selection and pricing strategies were implemented to focus on their core business where acceptable profit margins could be attained. L&E reported a small loss for 2002 on a 12% decline in sales. The largest volume decrease was in the Automotive division where a poor European economy and intense competitive pricing caused negative results. Their focus is on cost control, reduced headcount, and expanded outsourcing of project work to lower cost countries. A new entity was created in China in 2002 to develop opportunities for both outsourcing and new business in this growing market. INDUSTRIES Industries sales declined 2% to $1,034.7 million, as market weakness seen in 2001 continued in 2002. Heil Environmental, Heil Trailer, Chief and PDQ experienced the largest sales declines. Earnings of $137.5 million were 3% above 2001 levels, were impacted by restructuring charges of $3.7 million related to plant closings and the exiting of certain product lines. Segment margins improved slightly to 13%. The impact of goodwill amortization on earnings for the full year in 2001 was $14.6 million. Heil Environmentals performance declined in 2002 as a soft market, reductions in municipal budgets for refuse collection vehicles, and new engine emission regulations combined to curtail sales. A majority of municipalities redirected funds initially targeted for refuse collection equipment to support security and emergency response infrastructure. In addition, many private, municipal and large retail haulers postponed chassis purchases due to concerns regarding the performance of new engines mandated by the new emission regulations. Countering these negative trends, Environmental introduced a number of new products to address customer needs and downsized their workforce given the lower volumes. A management change was also initiated as a new President was named who had previously been in charge of Rotary Lift. Rotary Lift, one of Industries largest sales and earnings contributors, again delivered improved sales and earnings. Helped by zero percent financing driving car sales, Rotary capitalized on its ability to provide innovative solutions and nationwide service, and grew its car program business over 20%. Faced with a stagnant market and increasing competition from low cost Asian competitors, Rotary was once again able to grow market share. Rotarys focus on cost reduction allowed it to hold margins in a tough pricing environment. Additionally, its focus on providing productivity based solutions, as evidenced by their Inbay(TM) product, has insulated them to some degree from the pricing pressures seen at the commodity end of the business. Heil Trailers 2002 sales and earnings declined for the third consecutive year. The domestic bulk trailer industry remained slow for the entire year impacted by the slowest petroleum trailer market in the past 7 years. In addition, military sales were negatively impacted by delays in government testing. Trailer once again managed to increase share in both the petroleum and dry bulk trailer markets in the face of intense competitive pressures, driven by over capacity and a slow market. A strong focus on global markets resulted in Trailers international businesses contributing almost one quarter of their profits in 2002. Tipper Tie rebounded somewhat from a weak 2001, driven by a strong performance by their overseas subsidiary. Technopack, along with Alpina, a recent European acquisition, enjoyed a record year with sales of equipment, clips and loops all at record levels. This performance improvement was primarily driven by Eastern European demand. Tipper U.S. had a more difficult year as sales of equipment and clips slipped. Late in 2002, Tipper decided to eliminate a small product line, which negatively impacted profits in 2002. 36 Marathon entered 2002 facing a depressed waste management market which continued to slide throughout 2002 and was down 33% over the last two years. However, Marathon was able to grow market share and increase both sales and earnings while maintaining margins at above historical levels. Leveraging its broad product line enabled them to add new customers and gain additional business, even with an industry that saw an increase in internet auctions and severe pricing pressure. This was made possible through Marathons strong engineering focus, which they have parlayed to develop customer friendly products to meet the individual needs of waste haulage and chain store accounts. Triton improved significantly versus a weak 2001. Although the U.S. market was relatively flat, Tritons share improved behind the successful introduction of their "9100" product, a product focused on the broadest segment of the cash dispenser market. This product contributed more than 50% of unit sales since its mid year introduction. New products introduced into the other segments of the market also contributed. Tritons results internationally were also positive, lead by strong results in the U.K. Overall margins rebounded to 2000 levels behind increased sales and a reduced cost structure. With the vehicle wash equipment market softening significantly, PDQ saw both investors and corporate oil companies reduce their purchases in 2002. Oil company consolidation took its toll on sales, while the investor market was hurt by a difficulty in obtaining financing. As a result, for the first time since they were purchased by Dover in 1998, PDQ had a down year. Sales and earnings saw declines versus a record 2002, although they were flat compared to 2001. However, PDQ was still able to grow share. In addition, new products along with the implementation of "lean manufacturing" initiatives allowed PDQ to hold margins as well. The DI Foodservice Companies, which include Groen, Randell and Avtec, finished 2002 with flat sales and earnings. Declining tax receipts in most states and municipalities led to a slowdown in Groens institutional foodservice equipment market while Randells markets were impacted by cutbacks in new foodservice chain start ups. The newly identified DI Foodservice team is assessing various consolidation and synergy prospects. A change in the way they go to market put in place toward the latter part of 2002. Kurz Kasch, which was acquired in 2001, and whose primary products include electromagnetic stators and specialty plastics, saw margins decline (versus record levels in 2001) on relatively flat sales. Increased quality and engineering specifications imposed by customers, along with a weak market, contributed to the margin deterioration. Chief had a disappointing year in 2002 as both sales and earnings were down significantly. Softness in the economy coupled with changing insurance industry trends negatively impacted buying decisions. A combination of more cars being "totaled" and customers foregoing repairs to avoid higher insurance premiums has hurt the industry. Recognizing this market shift, Chief underwent a number of strategic changes to better serve its markets going forward. These include consolidating domestic channels of distribution, adding an inside sales support function, streamlining product offerings, and revising current approaches to installation, training, and service. Costs associated with these initiatives had a major impact on 2002 performance. Someros performance suffered from the third year of double digit market declines with non residential building down 17% and industrial construction off 45%. As a result, sales of their primary product, large laser screeds, were down significantly. They successfully introduced the "CopperHead" in 2002, a new product that primarily serves the upper deck and smaller floor concrete screeding markets. Dovatech, which consists of laser and chiller businesses, experienced difficult market conditions leading to double digit sales declines. RESOURCES Resources 2002 sales declined 8% primarily driven by declines in the oil and gas production markets served by the Energy Products Group and C. Lee Cook. Capital spending weakened in most markets and distributors reduced inventories. Earnings decreased 2% to $124.4 million. Full year results for 2001 included $7.1 million of inventory, restructuring and other charges. No comparable charges were recorded in 2002. Positive operating leverage (increased margins on flat to down sales) at most companies resulted from cost 37 reduction in operating expense and implementation of lean manufacturing programs. The impact of goodwill amortization on earnings for the full year in 2001 was $10.3 million. Operating margins were 14%, up from 13% in 2001. The market for the Energy Products Group was weak during 2002. Sales were down approximately 19% and earnings were off over 30%. Commodity prices remained high but drilling activity was down significantly as capital spending by oil companies was reduced. The core products of Norris and Alberta Oil Tool (AOT) saw a decline in international sucker rod sales but AOT drive rod sales remained strong. Continued penetration in the sucker rod guide and premium coupling markets should enhance future results as oilfield activity levels increase. Ferguson Beauregards plunger lift and automation products were off from the prior year. Norriseals 2002 sales and earnings were also below 2001 with an unfavorable product mix. Quartzdyne had record sales in 2002, as they gained new customers and increased their applications into the measurement while drilling market. Investments were made to vertically integrate their manufacturing processes. OPW Fueling Components maintained sales in 2002 equal to prior year, primarily as a result of two product line acquisitions made early in the year. Overall, earnings were below 2001 levels even though overhead structures were reduced. Sales and earnings increases were achieved in every market outside the U.S. with extremely strong growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. These increases were not enough to offset the declines caused by reduction in new service station construction in the U.S. markets. Industry consolidation at manufacturers, customers, and distributors accelerated in 2002. The consolidations at major oil companies and financial failure at several major convenience store chains provided an opportunity for customers to buy stations at reduced prices versus building new stations. Brevetti Nettuno, an Italian manufacturer of LPG nozzles, was acquired to broaden product offerings for alternative fuels. The acquisition of the Emco Electronics product line by Petro Vend has moved OPW into a much stronger market position in electronic tank gauging. These units were fully integrated in 2002 and now position Petro Vend to be a much stronger global player in this expanding market. De Sta Co Industries leveraged 9% earnings growth on flat sales due to full year results of on going cost reduction initiatives. The automation products demand grew in support of new vehicle model introductions in the automotive market. Industrial market clamps sales were slowly improving as customers implemented new tooling programs to reduce set up costs. Electronic market sales remained severely depressed. De Sta Co Industries expanded their Asian operations and have cost effective facilities operating on all major continents. The industrial pump companies (Blackmer and Wilden) recorded a 3% sales increase and a 19% earnings increase driven by a favorable product mix, innovative new products and operational improvements resulting from lean manufacturing initiatives. Blackmer gains were driven by increased sales at government accounts, System One sales, and improved performance in Europe. Blackmer continues to implement lean manufacturing initiatives and consolidated its Oklahoma City compressor operations into its System One facility in Massachusetts. Wilden Pump benefited from improved sales of its new food line and plastic bolted series pumps. Wilden domestic sales were flat but international sales to the Far East were up significantly. During 2002, Wilden began to establish a wholly owned foreign entity in China to strengthen their presence in that region. OPW Fluid Transfer Group improved earnings on reduced sales in 2002 as cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2001 produced positive results and improved margins. The depressed bulk cargo tank and railcar markets hampered U.S. growth but European sales set a new record. Although chemical processing markets were down, renewed emphasis was placed on new products to existing customers. C. Lee Cook sales and earnings were off significantly as demand from gas compressor OEMs and aftermarket requirements slowed. Service work on existing field products maintained levels similar with 2001. A new service center for the West Coast was opened and manufacturing expansions were completed that will support future growth. The Manley valve business had operating results equal to 2001 on slightly reduced sales volume. The longer term outlook for Cook products continued to be very favorable as gas production and processing activity increased. 38 The Tulsa Winch Group was challenged in 2002 by significant declines in construction equipment markets, aerial lift markets, and a slow petroleum market. Strong cost reduction efforts maintained solid operating margins and positioned the company to benefit as market conditions improved. The military winch business remained strong and was driven by long term contracts. The crane overload protection products are targeting new applications in the higher volume, smaller capacity mobile crane market. RPA Process Technologies (RPA) experienced significant delays in capital spending from its customer base in 2002. Sales and earnings were both off significantly with its European unit only contributing with major project shipments in the fourth quarter. RPA implemented significant process improvements during the year. Hydro Systems posted record earnings on slightly reduced sales led by improved earnings at Nova Controls and continued expansion in European markets. The industrial cleaning market served by Hydro was slightly depressed in 2002 due to slower hotel and restaurant business. De Sta Co Manufacturing had flat sales and earnings with continued pricing pressure from their automotive customer base. Sales slowed during the fourth quarter in their automotive market as well as in their Hydro Cam tool and die business. De Sta Co Manufacturing continued to work on new product initiatives to broaden its exposure to new markets. Duncan Industries had flat sales and earnings increases, and positioned itself for an upturn by reducing costs internally and through improvement in quality and cost reduction initiatives with outside suppliers. Wittemann was sold in the first quarter of 2002 at a very modest loss. TECHNOLOGIES Technologies sales decreased 13% from 2001 levels to $1,036.5 million. As a result, Technologies reported a loss of $30.3 million as compared to earnings of $5.6 million for 2001. The impact of goodwill amortization on earnings for the full year 2001 was $12.1 million. Included in the losses for 2002 and 2001 were $35.2 million and $43.3 million of charges, respectively, for restructuring, inventory reserves and other charges. The strengthening of, and the increased focus on, the medical, automotive and military markets were not enough to offset the continued major softness in the computer and industrial electronics market segments. Although, it appeared that a recovery was beginning to take place in the spring of 2002, it became clear that this was not sustainable for the remainder of 2002. Accordingly, the companies serving the communications, computer and industrial electronics industries began to resize their companies for profitability at the sales levels they were experiencing during the second half of the year. By the end of the first quarter 2002, the Circuit Board Assembly and Test (CBAT) businesses and the Specialty Electronics Components (SEC) businesses reduced their workforces by 15% and 13%, respectively, from the beginning of 2002. In addition, where warranted, the companies reduced their capacity needs to adapt to the current market opportunities. The most significant change at substantially all of the CBAT and SEC companies was the geographic shift in their markets. The year marked the continued shift to Asia (with an emphasis on China) for Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) companies, and China was the strongest of the telecommunications equipment markets. By the end of 2002, substantially all of the CBAT companies were manufacturing in China either at their own facility or through subcontractors. Where the strengths of the markets warrant, the SEC companies will have Asian based sales offices and in certain cases manufacturing facilities. While the American markets reflected stronger automotive, medical and military opportunities, the Asian, and in particular China, markets offered the best opportunity for telecommunication equipment and electronic assembly growth in the near term. CBAT Technologies CBAT businesses recorded a loss of $55.7 million in the year 2002 which included inventory, restructuring and other charges of $25.9 million compared to a loss of $52.8 million in 2001 which 39 included inventory, restructuring and other charges of $33.3 million. Sales for 2002 were $598.6 million, a decrease of 7% from full year 2001 results. Universal Instruments experienced a decline in sales of 15% from 2001, and recorded a slightly smaller loss than in 2001. In the third quarter of 2002, Universal undertook an aggressive reorganization, including significant reductions in staff, redefining its sales channels by current market opportunities, tailoring specific products for high volume automotive manufacturing, and opening a 100,000 square foot plant in China (which commenced operation in February 2002). During 2002, the actions Universal took resulted in its ability to maintain and actually increase its market share. Universal continued to invest in significant product development to address future circuit board and component placement needs. Everett Charles Technologies sales increased slightly as its acquisition of MultiTest was held for all of 2002 versus only seven months of 2001. The North American test market remained very weak while customer new product introductions (NPI) were also slow. ECTs probe and fixture business depend to a large degree on customer NPI. ECTs two German bare board test equipment companies maintained their sales levels and increased their profitability. The back end semiconductor test market showed some strengthening in the second half of 2002, up significantly from the second half of 2001. DEK, though seeing a similar decrease in sales of 14% over 2001, still maintained a market leadership position. It acquired Acumen, a manufacturer of stencils in North America and Asia, giving DEK a global presence in an increasingly important segment of the process consumables and tooling business. DEK has expanded its capabilities to serve the semiconductor industry and is manufacturing some of its product line in China. OK International saw a smaller decline in sales for 2002 compared to 2001 and reported a loss. OK depends to a large part on the overall electronics manufacturing industry and its results reflected the softness in that market. Vitronics Soltec was able to maintain its sales at the 2001 level with the release of a Selective Soldering product line, improving their competitive position. Alphasem reported a strong gain in sales of 16% despite the overall decline in the semiconductor industry. Alphasem manufactures die bonding equipment for the back end of the semiconductor industry. Despite its improved sales efforts, Alphasem still reflected a loss in 2002 which was 9% better than the loss in 2001 as Alphasem tried to meet the demands of new product innovation. Dover Technologies acquired Hover Davis in the fourth quarter of 2002. Hover Davis is the largest independent manufacturer of component feeding, direct die feeding and label printing devices for the circuit board assembly market. It sells its products directly to both OEM (including Universal Instruments) and end users of placement equipment. Since it was acquired in the fourth quarter, it did not have a significant impact on reported sales or earnings. Since the beginning of 2001, all of the CBAT companies have reduced their operating costs significantly and are finding less expensive sources for their materials or manufacturing locations. Their product development is on track for addressing their customers needs. SEC In Technologies SEC companies, sales for 2002 were $205.6 million compared to $341.6 million in 2001, a decrease of 40%. SEC reported a loss of $12.1 million in 2002 which included inventory, restructuring and other charges of $9.9 million compared to earnings of $45.6 million in 2001 which included restructuring and other charges of $10.2 million. The SEC companies produce highly specialized, often custom designed, high end components used in a wide variety of electronic devices. During 2002, all of the SEC companies began to shift their focus from predominantly serving the wired and wireless telecommunications industry, to high reliability medical, space, avionics and military applications. Though there was a greater mix of industries served at the end of 2002, the largest customer base still remained in the telecommunications market. Much of the excess industry inventory 40 built up during 2000 and early 2001 was depleted in 2002. However, the telecom and datacom service providers remained very cautious in their capital equipment spending as their business models were changing and new Federal telecommunications regulations were being developed. Although it is starting to become apparent that the imbedded communications infrastructure systems and equipment are showing the stresses of increased capacity and lack of investment over the past 24 months, it will be necessary for the anticipated Federal regulations to evolve and a rationalization of the business model of these telecom service providers to occur before growth in capital spending will resume. The timing of this impact is unknown. Vectrons (formerly referred to as Quadrant) sales decreased significantly resulting in an operating loss for 2002. Vectron, under a new President, began a major restructuring early in the year to consolidate facilities, reorganize the company structure to better address the changes in its customer base and product needs, and to right size its workforce. It also has focused on the Asian market and in growing its high reliability space and military positions. K&L Microwave saw a significant decrease in sales but was able to maintain a slight profit. It was hard hit by the telecommunication downturn as it serves the base station deployment customers. K&L has opened a facility in Nanjing, China to provide telecommunication infrastructure products to the growing Chinese and Asian markets. Dow Key Microwave improved its earnings on relatively flat sales. Dow Key had a strong military and space program that continued to see funding for product deployment. The capacitor companies, Novacap and Dielectric, saw continued decreases in their sales, as they both serve the telecommunications industries. However, their specialty products have avionics, military and medical applications which were showing growth. Novacap and Dielectric reported small losses mostly attributable to write off of excess equipment. MARKING AND CODING Imaje, the French based industrial ink jet printer and ink manufacturer, had full year 2002 earnings of $49.8 million which were down 7% from 2001 but still generated the highest earnings of any Dover company. Sales were up 11% to $232.2 million from 2001. Imaje continued with the integration of its mid 2001 acquisition of Markpoint, with sales increasing 11%. A new thermal printer line was rolled out to the Imaje marketing channels. In 2002, Imaje had strong global presence selling direct in the majority of its markets while using distributors to expand its reach to over 90 countries. As a result of a tight industrial market place in Europe and the Americas, and the increasing mix of Markpoint products, which utilizes somewhat less consumables in their marking, margins decreased from 26% to 21%. In 2002, Imaje opened its new ink plant and research and development center at its headquarters in Valence, France. RESTRUCTURING AND INVENTORY CHARGES During 2002 and 2001, the Companys segments and operating companies initiated a variety of restructuring programs. These restructuring programs focused on reducing the overall cost structure primarily through reductions in headcount and through the disposition or closure of certain non strategic or redundant product lines and manufacturing facilities. Restructuring charges are comprised of employee separation and facility exit costs. Restructuring charges for continuing operations were recorded as selling and administrative expenses. The employee separation programs for continuing operations announced have involved approximately 3,700 employees, all of whom have been terminated as of December 31, 2003. The Company has completed the vast majority of restructuring programs undertaken in 2002 by the end of 2003 and the majority of the 2001 restructuring programs were completed by December 31, 2002. The remaining exit reserves relate to future lease payments for facilities that were closed. These costs will be paid over the remaining term of each lease. In 2002, the Company initiated restructuring programs at selected operating companies with ongoing efforts to reduce costs in the continually challenging business environments in which the Company operates. The total restructuring charges related to these programs in 2002 were $28.7 million. The restructuring charges included both employee separation costs of $11.9 million and costs associated with exit activities of $16.8 million. The restructuring in Technologies took place in the CBAT and SEC groups, in response to the 41 significant declines in the end markets served by these operations. CBAT recorded $6.6 million for employee separation and $11.2 million for exit activities. The majority of the severance and exit costs were incurred at Universal, Everett Charles and DEK. The facility exit costs are comprised of lease terminations and idle equipment impairments. SEC recorded $2.5 million for employee separation and $3.6 million for facility exit activities, a majority of which costs were incurred at Quadrant and Novacap. Industries recorded restructuring charges of $3.7 million, of which $2.1 million was incurred to exit an under performing product line at Tipper Tie. The remaining $1.6 million was for employee separation and other exit costs. Diversified recorded $1.1 million of restructuring charges to rationalize its SWF business of which $0.8 million was for severance. Due to significant declines in the demand for certain products, special inventory reserves of $12.0 million were established in 2002, primarily in the Technologies segment and to a lesser degree in the Diversified segment. During 2001, the Company initiated various restructuring programs in response to the downturn in the end markets served within its Technologies segment and to reduce the overall cost structure in the Diversified, Industries and Resources segments. The total restructuring charges related to these programs in 2001 was $17.2 million. The restructuring charges included both employee separation costs of $11.7 million and $5.5 million for exit costs. The Technologies segment recorded restructuring charges in CBAT primarily for costs associated with employee separation of $5.1 million. In addition, as a result of the downturn in the end markets served, CBAT recorded charges of $1.4 million for exit costs.

NON GAAP DISCLOSURES In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Companys results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company also discloses non GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, net debt, capitalization, and revenues and working capital excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, sales and working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes the net debt to capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of liquidity and operating performance because they provide both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions and repay debt. Management believes that reporting revenues and working capital at constant currency, which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, provides a meaningful measure of the Companys operational changes, given the global nature of Dovers businesses. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK INTEREST RATES The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of long term fixed interest rate debt, commercial paper borrowings and investments in cash equivalents. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. A 65 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates (10% of the Companys weighted average long term debt interest rate) would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of the Companys long term debt. Commercial paper borrowings are at variable interest rates, and have maturities of three months or 42 less. An 11 basis point increase or decrease in the interest rates (10% of the Companys weighted average commercial paper interest rate) on commercial paper borrowings would have an immaterial impact on the Companys pre tax earnings. All highly liquid investments, including highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less, are considered cash equivalents. The Company places its investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer. A 10 basis point decrease or increase in interest rates (10% of the Companys weighted average interest rate) would have an immaterial impact on the Companys pre tax earnings. During 2003, the Company entered into three interest rate swaps as discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Company does not enter into derivative financial or derivative commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes. FOREIGN EXCHANGE The Company conducts business in various foreign currencies, primarily in Canada, Europe, China and other Asian countries. Therefore, changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect the Companys financial position and cash flows when translated into U.S. Dollars. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2003 the Company had not established a formal foreign currency hedging program but may, from time to time, for a specific exposure, enter into fair value hedges. The Company has mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which the majority of all costs are local currency based. A 20% or less change in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the Companys financial position and cash flows. 43
