ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 2004 COMPARED WITH 2003 SUMMARY Sales for 2004 of $5,488.1 million were up $1,074.8 million or 24% from 2003, primarily driven by increases of $396.9 million at Technologies and $354.6 million at Resources. Technologies sales were impacted by positive trends in the global electronics industry, particularly in the back end semiconductor market, as well as expansion of the Chinese manufacturing capacity. Resources sales increased due to improved market conditions and the full year impact of the 2003 acquisition of Warn Industries. Industries sales increased $181.2 million and Diversifieds sales increased by $142.6 million. Sales would have increased 20.9% to $5,336.9 million if 2003 foreign currency translation rates were applied to 2004 results. Acquisitions completed during 2004 contributed $104.1 million to sales and contributed gross profit of $38.6 million. Gross profit of $1,894.4 million in 2004 represented a 25% increase compared to $1,520.4 million in 2003. Gross profit margins for both 2004 and 2003 were 34.5% as volume increases in the current year were offset by rising commodity prices. Selling and administrative expenses for 2004 were $1,282.2 million or 23% of net sales, compared to $1,076.7 million or 24% of net sales in 2003. The increase in selling and administration expenses includes the costs related to Sarbanes Oxley requirements and increases in compensation and pension benefits. Operating profit of $612.2 million for 2004 increased $168.4 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the 24% increase in revenues, benefits from the Companys restructuring programs undertaken during 2002 and 2001, and slightly improved global economic conditions. Operating profit margin for 2004 was 11.2% compared to 10.1% for 2003. Net interest expense decreased 1% to $61.3 million for 2004, compared to $62.2 million for 2003. The primary reason for the decrease in net interest expense was income related to the Companys outstanding interest rate swaps related to a portion of its long term debt. Other net income for 2004 was $1.2 million and includes gains on dispositions, favorable settlements and miscellaneous credits of $9.9 million which were largely offset by foreign exchange losses of $8.7 million. Other expenses of $9.7 million for 2003 primarily related to foreign exchange losses of $6.2 million. The foreign exchange losses in both 2004 and 2003 primarily relate to appreciation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. Dovers effective 2004 tax rate for continuing operations was 25.9% compared to the 2003 rate of 23.3%. The low effective tax rate for both years is largely due to the continuing benefit from tax credit programs such as those for R&E combined with the benefit from U.S. export programs, lower effective foreign tax rates from the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards and the recognition of certain capital loss benefits which were higher in 2003. Net earnings from continuing operations for 2004 were $409.1 million or $2.00 per diluted share compared to $285.2 million or $1.40 per diluted share from continuing operations in 2003. For 2004, net earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle were $412.8 million or $2.02 per diluted share, including $3.6 million or $.02 per diluted share in earnings from discontinued operations, compared to $292.9 million or $1.44 per diluted share for 2003, which included $7.7 million or $.04 per diluted share in earnings from discontinued operations. Discontinued operations earnings for 2004 were $3.6 million compared to earnings of $7.7 million in 2003. During 2003, in connection with the completion of a federal income tax audit and commercial resolution of other issues, the Company adjusted certain reserves, established in connection with the sales of previously discontinued operations, and recorded a gain on the sales of discontinued operations net of tax of $16.6 million, and additional tax benefits of $5.1 million related to losses previously incurred on sales of business. These amounts were offset by charges of $13.6 million, net of tax, to reduce discontinued businesses to their estimated fair value, and a loss on the sale of discontinued operations net of tax of $6.0 million related to contingent liabilities from previously discontinued operations. Total losses from discontinued operations in 18 2002 primarily relate to charges to reduce discontinued businesses to their estimated fair value. Please refer to Note 7 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. For 2002, the impact of the adoption of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," resulted in a net loss of $121.3 million. The adoption resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $345.1 million ($293.0 million, net of tax, or $1.44 diluted earnings per share). The adoption of the standard also discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective January 1, 2002. There were no goodwill impairments charges in 2004 and 2003. DIVERSIFIED TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 2003 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS, UNAUDITED) Net sales.......................................... $1,310,835 $1,168,256 12% Earnings........................................... 149,779 131,867 14% Operating margins.................................. 11.4% 11.3% Bookings........................................... 1,412,384 1,161,012 22% Book to Bill....................................... 1.08 0.99 Backlog............................................ 440,583 334,349 32% Diversifieds earnings increased 14% on a 12% sales increase, as capital equipment markets improved throughout the year. The earnings increase was achieved mainly through higher sales volumes, new products and successful marketing programs. Most of the companies, especially SWEP, Tranter PHE and Hill Phoenix, were negatively affected by significantly increased raw material prices. Crenlo, Mark Andy, Graphics Microsystems, and Hydratight Sweeney accounted for most of the earnings gain, which was somewhat offset by declines at SWF and Belvac. Segment bookings improved 22% over prior year, and Diversified enters 2005 with a record year end backlog. Hill Phoenix reported record sales and bookings, and earnings were the second best ever at 3% below last years record. Despite slower overall market conditions and consolidations in the supermarket industry, Hill Phoenix continues to grow sales through expansion of its customer base by offering industry leading product innovations and strong customer service. Earnings at Refrigeration Systems and National Cooler both exceeded last year. These increases were offset by lower earnings at Display Cases, which was heavily impacted by the unprecedented rise in commodity costs and a slow down in new construction and remodels by two of its major customers. Margins were down slightly as the rise in material prices outpaced the businesses ability to increase prices or fully offset them with cost reduction initiatives. Revenue growth is expected to continue in 2005 as Hill Phoenix finished the year with its highest backlog in three years. Sargent reported record sales, fueled by the continued recovery of the commercial and defense aerospace markets. Earnings improved 10%, however margins were negatively impacted by start up investments in a facility in Mexico and increased operational support for Sargent Canadas 89% volume increase. Raw material availability and increasing cost remained a challenge at all business units, especially at Sonic. Record bookings improved 23% over prior year, led by the Marine Division being awarded a large U.S. military order for a submarine ship set. Performance Motorsports produced excellent operating leverage as earnings increased 15% on a 4% sales increase. Their performance was driven by the recovery of the automotive racing and powersports markets, the addition of new customers and improved operating efficiency. Earnings records were set at three of their business units, JE Pistons, ProX and Carrillo. JE Pistons and Carrillo achieved market share gains with a number of NASCAR racing teams, while ProX benefited from new products and improved distribution. Wisecos margins declined as a result of manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the shift from 2 cycle to 4 cycle pistons. Performance Motorsports exceeded prior year sales, earnings and margins in every quarter of 2004. 19 SWEP achieved record bookings, sales and earnings, while margins decreased slightly due to significant material cost increases. Order activity was steady throughout the year in both its heat pump and boiler markets, and production capacity was increased with both capital investments and productivity programs to meet the growing demand. Earnings were up 12%, driven by volume increases, cost reduction and favorable currency rates. Due to brisk sales in Asia, the plant in Malaysia increased production volume by almost 100% for the year. Tranter PHE set new bookings and sales records in 2004, though earnings dropped below last year by 2%. Earnings benefited from the higher sales volume, but were more than offset by significantly increased stainless steel and titanium prices and costs associated with the implementation of a new business system. Prior investment made in its low cost facility in India produced increased capacity and allowed it to double output in 2004. Margins improved significantly in the fourth quarter, due to an improved sales mix, better pricing and a reduced workforce. Tranter PHE has had success in selling to new markets such as ethanol plants in the U.S. and processing plants in Brazil. Belvac finished the year with flat sales compared to 2003. Earnings were down 16% due to investments in product development, start up costs associated with opening a new facility in the Czech Republic, and increases in commodity costs. Bookings, especially in the second half, were very strong and increased by 41% for the full year. The increase in bookings is related to a growing requirement for can size diversity, conversions in can top sizes, and growth in the European market. A significant portion of its business includes spares and retrofits that improve productivity of its customers equipment. Backlog at year end was at its highest point in seven years and was 72% higher than the prior year. Crenlo achieved record bookings and sales, due to increased cab volumes with key customers in the construction/agriculture equipment market. In addition to the higher volume, its earnings and margins increased significantly as a result of solid execution of its performance improvement plan. Although steel costs continued to be a significant issue, it was able to pass through the majority of the price increase to its customers. Its specialty enclosure business reported flat sales and earnings for the year. Crenlos backlog increased each quarter, and ended the year at 49% above 2003. Mark Andys results were much improved over prior year, as it achieved record sales and bookings and more than doubled earnings. Significant growth in label press orders were driven by the strength of the Euro, U.S. tax incentives and improvements in sales strategies. A number of new product introductions in both the Mark Andy and Comco product lines have enhanced its technology leadership position in the industry. Growth was seen in both the domestic and international markets, and indications are that it has taken market share from competitors. Hydratight Sweeney had a record year, as earnings grew 57% on a sales gain of 23%. Its tension and service business drove the performance with strong sales to the robust oil and gas markets, especially in the North Sea and the Middle East. Both its Morgrip and Hevilift product lines made strong contributions to its results in 2004. The Torque business units results were down to prior year due to low hydraulic sales, partially offset by increased industrial and aero sales, especially to military customers. Waukesha Bearings reported slightly lower earnings on flat sales as the power generation market is experiencing a slow recovery. However, its oil and gas markets continue to be buoyant and are expected to remain strong in 2005. The decline in earnings is primarily the result of significant one time charges associated with a warranty reserve, employee redundancy and recruitment costs, and a write down of a facility held for sale, partially offset by a favorable legal settlement. Bookings and backlog were up due to a large order in the nuclear equipment market for its CRL business unit. Graphics Microsystems had an outstanding year with record bookings, sales and earnings, as it won significant business from six new key customers for its color and ink control products. It has been successful at changing its business model, moving its customer base from small and medium size printers in the aftermarket to large printers and the high end new press OEM market. A new product was added, ribbon control, which was successfully approved by an OEM customer as the standard for its presses. A sizeable R&D operation was 20 established in India, which directly contributed to Graphics Microsystems market growth by improving software quality and the overall development process. SWF had a disappointing year, with declines in sales and a loss for the year. Results continued to be adversely affected by high warranty costs and product development expenses. The lack of sustained bookings at a level for efficient production was another significant negative factor in its performance. Although market activity improved, the closing cycle for capital investment in packaging automation continued to increase. The acquisition of GSMA Systems in March of 2004 increased the companys capabilities by being able to provide robotic solutions to complex handling problems. INDUSTRIES TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 2003 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS, UNAUDITED) Net sales.......................................... $1,221,178 $1,039,930 17% Earnings........................................... 138,359 121,200 14% Operating margins.................................. 11.3% 11.7% Bookings........................................... 1,255,104 1,105,046 14% Book to Bill....................................... 1.03 1.06 Backlog............................................ 238,954 201,866 18% Dover Industries sales increased 17% reflecting continued market share gains helped by considerable new product introductions. Sales have now increased for seven consecutive quarters. Earnings grew 14%, driven by sales gains but were offset by rising steel prices. The largest contributors to earnings increases were Heil Environmental due to share gains and Chief Automotive which benefited from new product introductions. Heil Environmentals performance improved versus 2003 despite significant steel cost increases, as a small decline in the Refuse Collection Vehicle market was offset by market share gains. An increase in buying in municipal markets, increases in market share within the national account segment, further penetration into the independent hauler segment, and an active New York City market drove revenues to double digit gains. Bayne, a 2001 acquisition, also contributed with record performance during the year driven primarily by newly gained distribution. Heils European business grew as well, increasing market share in the municipal market. Rotary Lift delivered improved sales driven partially by market share gains in the important 2 post segment of the market, although much of the increase in revenues was due to new product categories introduced in the latter half of 2003 that carry lower margins. Earnings were also hampered by escalating steel costs and margin pressures from low cost Asian imports. Rotary continues to focus on providing productivity based solutions, which has partially insulated it from severe pricing pressures seen at the commodity end of the business. Rotarys European operations, enhanced by the acquisition of Blitz in mid 2003, delivered double digit gains in their first full year as Rotary Lift Europe. Total Rotary year end backlog is up over 40% compared to 2003. Heil Trailer, the only global manufacturer of tank trailers, recovered from a weak 2003. A stronger US tank market, improved results in Argentina due to pent up demand in the Argentine and surrounding economies, and strong governmental sales at Kalyn Siebert drove the favorable comparisons. However, a stagnant Asian market hurt by ambivalent enforcement of truck weight limits, plant shut down expenses in the UK, and material cost escalations partially offset this gain. Revenues were positively impacted by a full year of military shipments, although rising steel costs impacted profitability. Tipper Tie reported its best results in over four years. Tippers international operations, which account for 60% of sales, had another strong year, building from 2003s solid results. Despite weakness in the German market, the result of a consolidating retail environment, international sales increased over 10% driven by strength in Eastern Europe, primarily Russia, Poland, Romania, Hungary and the Baltic states. Alpina, a Swiss company acquired in 2000, delivered record sales and earnings surpassing its record performance in 21 2003. The US business rebounded moderately amid continued pricing pressures. Tipper Tie benefited from strength in the European currencies which was offset by increased aluminum costs. Marathon delivered record sales driven by strength across its product line. Recycling products had a strong year as baler sales increased behind new product introductions and product redesigns. Marathon increased its market share due in part to a large one time order from a national account, by leveraging its broad product line, and by focusing engineering efforts on identifying customer needs. This has led to increased new product activity that will continue into 2005. Accordingly, backlogs are up 19%. Investments in products for major retail, financial institutions, and global customers drove Tritons sales to the highest level in its history. During the year, Triton produced its 100,000(th)ATM while achieving sales of over 20,000 units. This year marked the transition from serving primarily low end retail ATM markets to becoming a player in the mid to high end market of major retail and financial institutions. Costs associated with these endeavors hampered margins, but set the stage for positive returns in 2005 and beyond. In Canada, unit sales were at an all time high, while European unit sales climbed over 30%. PDQs revenues were flat with the prior year as the "in bay automatic domestic market held relatively flat throughout the year. After a relatively strong start to the year, poor weather and rising gas prices were negative influences on orders, which began to fall off in the third quarter. Sales to major oil companies were up for the year, but investor sales were flat as hurricanes and heavy rain reduced near term car wash volume and therefore made current investors reconsider their replacement and expansion plans for the year. New products introduced during the year were well received. Both the G5 S Series, a higher end Laser wash, and the Access machine, a wash activation unit, delivered sales gains in excess of 50% but were not enough to make up for a less active jobber market. DI Foodservice, which includes Groen, Randell, and Avtec, reported a revenue decline and a 70% decline in earnings. Continued weakness in municipal spending negatively impacted the institutional equipment market for the third consecutive year. 2004 saw numerous chain restaurant new store openings being delayed or put on hold. Earnings results were also impacted by a number of adverse accrual adjustments that occurred during the year. A management change has been implemented, and performance is expected to improve in 2005. Kurz Kaschs revenues increased over 40% in 2004, primarily driven by the effect of the acquisition of Wabash Magnetics at the end of 2003. Strong specialty plastics sales offset weakness in stator sales. Performance at Wabash was above expectations driven primarily by strength in its irrigation markets. Profits at Kurz Kasch Consolidated increased over 2003 levels, but were impacted by unfavorable product mix and plant closing costs associated with the Wabash acquisition. Despite a continued soft economy, consolidation of the auto repair market, rising steel prices, and insurance industry trends negatively impacting the collision industry, Chief delivered its best performance since 2001. Rebounding from a difficult year in 2003, Chief grew sales and earnings at double digit rates fueled by the introduction of new pulling products and a 75% increase in measuring equipment unit sales. Somero grew sales and earnings as the introduction of two new products contributed to gains both domestically and internationally. The SXP large screed was developed to replace the original laser screed machine and sales of large screeds doubled from 2003 levels. The Copperhead XD, a product that primarily serves the upper deck and smaller floor concrete screeding markets, was improved to add more power and torque and contributed to an 18% sales gain in Copperhead revenue. International sales increased to 30% of total revenue, driven by new market penetration in Europe and Australia. Koolant Koolers rode a recovery in the machine tool industry and posted double digit sales and earnings gains. In addition, Koolant Koolers continued its diversification into other markets and applications, making significant inroads into the food processing market in 2004. At Schreiber, a recovery in the plastics and welding markets was partially offset by a slowdown in medical shipments. 22 RESOURCES TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 2003 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS, UNAUDITED) Net sales........................................... $1,337,229 $982,658 36% Earnings............................................ 216,291 136,851 58% Operating margins................................... 16.2% 13.9% Bookings............................................ 1,394,810 990,057 41% Book to Bill........................................ 1.04 1.01 Backlog............................................. 163,460 104,395 57% Dover Resources 2004 sales increased 36%, or $355 million, to $1,337 million primarily due to relatively strong conditions in markets served by Dover Resources companies. The strength was most prevalent in those companies in the oil and gas equipment group (Energy Products Group and C. Lee Cook) and those in the material handling group (Tulsa Winch, Texas Hydraulics, and Warn) that serve the construction equipment, mobile crane, recovery vehicle, and power sports markets. All 12 Resources companies increased bookings versus 2003 and Dover Resources ended the year with a backlog that was 57% above prior year. Earnings increased by 58%, or $79 million to $216 million and operating margins increased 2.3 points to 16.2%. Warn, which was acquired on October 1, 2003, continued to generate strong growth and earnings in the first full year as a Dover company. Warn experienced record sales in power sports products, strong growth in its branded truck products, and continued growth in powertrain products driven by increased demand for light trucks and sport utility vehicles. Sales increases of 22% generated earnings increases of 13%, which included the impact of increased material costs that could not be immediately passed on to OEM customers. The new WARN Works(R) line of lifting and pulling products gained market acceptance at two major home improvement retailers. The continued flow of new products at Warn is expected to fuel future growth. The Energy Products Group financials include four months of the results of US Synthetic, which was acquired on August 31, 2004. 2004 was a strong year for the Energy Products Group in terms of sales and earnings growth. The business did an excellent job of offsetting material price increases and managing through difficult issues of material shortages. OPW Fueling Components continued to grow both sales and earnings, a result of continued expansion of new environmental regulations, as well as an increase in retail service station construction and remodeling. OPW also benefited from the opening of a new manufacturing facility in China and an expanded presence in Brazil. The business generated significant cost savings from its global sourcing efforts and continued expansion of its Six Sigma quality process. OPW Fluid Transfer Group increased earnings 26% on a 22% sales increase and had strong performance at each of its business units. The rail tank car market experienced stronger growth than recent years and was a factor in the improved results at Midland. Civacon, Engineered Systems, and European operations all saw improvement in their transportation and loading equipment markets. The Group continued to strengthen its global presence with the expansion into Brazil. The synergy generated across its business units outside the U.S. has been a driver of international growth. Wilden grew both sales and earnings in 2004 with exceptionally good growth outside the U.S. Sales increased 8%, excluding the impact of the Almatec acquisition, which was completed on December 17, 2004. Blackmer benefited from restructuring and consolidation initiatives in 2003. The business generated strong earnings leverage as a result of these initiatives and from actions to grow revenue. Earnings increased significantly on a sales increase of 13%. Blackmers French operations also had a strong year with increases in sales and earnings resulting from initiatives to further expand its presence outside of France. De Sta Co leveraged an 8% sales increase into a very strong earnings performance. Most of De Sta Cos markets were solid in 2004 with strong growth in robotics tooling and through major industrial catalog sales. 23 These strengths were dampened by slow growth in the automotive tooling and work holding markets. Germany was a solid contributor to the improved business results, due in part to a weaker U.S. dollar. The Tulsa Winch Group achieved record sales in 2004 with positive market conditions in most segments served by Tulsa Winch. In particular, the petroleum, military, construction equipment, and mobile crane markets rebounded in early 2004 and provided increased opportunities for growth. The business has been able to realize synergy in sales and engineering from the acquisitions of DP, Pullmaster, and Greer, which were acquired in 2000. The product synergies are expected to provide even more growth opportunities as electronic sensing is further expanded across the traditional mechanical and hydraulic winch product offering. Texas Hydraulics experienced record bookings in 2004 and was challenged to overcome capacity constraints and material cost and availability issues. To accommodate both sales and earnings increases of over 60%, Texas Hydraulics undertook a number of improvements, including further expansion of "lean concepts," selective outsourcing and capital investments, which have proven to be positive factors. The company is now positioned to benefit from these improvements in 2005. C. Lee Cook generated a 21% earnings improvement on a 7% sales increase. The markets served by Cook (gas compression and transmission) were exceptionally strong in 2004, both in the OEM equipment and the maintenance and service sectors. Even though Cook had a facility destroyed by a fire in January 2004, the business was able to recover and get back into operation without a loss of customers or profitability. Hydro Systems finished 2004 on a strong note and for the full year achieved an earnings increase of 5% on a sales increase of 7%. Results were dampened by a legal settlement in early 2004. The business achieved strong results from its European operations, benefited from a downsizing in one of its U.S. facilities, and has begun to see growth in its newly established Brazil business. RPA Process Technologies completed a year of "rebuilding." After implementing a restructuring of its French operations in mid 2004, the business returned to profitability in the second half of 2004. The business achieved record levels of bookings in 2004 and has a backlog that exceeds 40% of its sales plan for 2005. There are still challenges facing the business in terms of global positioning and the need to re invigorate the product offering, but the management team is clearly focused on making the necessary changes. TECHNOLOGIES TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 2003 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS, UNAUDITED) Net sales.......................................... $1,628,135 $1,231,241 32% Earnings........................................... 162,198 84,763 91% Operating margins.................................. 10.0% 6.9% Bookings........................................... 1,612,722 1,275,598 26% Book to Bill....................................... 0.99 1.04 Backlog............................................ 215,157 182,427 18% Technologies sales increased to $1,628 million, a 32% increase over 2003. Earnings increased $77 million or 91%. The overall electronics industry continued its recovery, which commenced in 2003. Particularly strong was the mid year activity in the back end semiconductor markets. However, by the fourth quarter, the semiconductor and related markets had slowed significantly as did the level of Chinese contract manufacturers capital expenditures. MARKING AND CODING Imaje had record sales (up 16%) and earnings (up 7%) and continues to see growth in all of its product areas: Continuous Ink Jet (CIJ) applications in primary packaging and Drop on Demand (DOD) and Thermal Transfer on Line (TTOL) applications in secondary packaging and large character printing. CIJ unit volume for the year was at a record level although non CIJ products are becoming an increasing percentage of 24 Imajes business. The newly released Print & Apply product is being very well received in the market. The industrial markets served by Imaje and its competitors continue to be very competitive with pressure on pricing. Imaje continues to invest in globalizing its infrastructure. During 2004, Imaje opened a new and larger manufacturing facility in Shanghai, China, relocated from Xiamen, China. In addition, during December, Imaje completed the acquisition of Datamax International, a Florida based manufacturer of bar code printers, which will operate as a separate business unit. As this acquisition closed near year end, Datamax had very little impact on the sales and earnings of Imaje for 2004. CIRCUIT BOARD ASSEMBLY AND TEST (CBAT) TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 2003 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS, UNAUDITED) Net sales........................................... $1,037,470 $731,749 42% Earnings............................................ 116,559 43,691 167% Operating margins................................... 11.2% 6.0% Bookings............................................ 1,014,865 760,923 33% Book to Bill........................................ 0.98 1.04 Backlog............................................. 110,281 107,036 3% Technologies CBAT businesses reported earnings of $117 million, an increase of $73 million or 167%. Sales increased 42% to $1,037 million, while bookings increased 33% to $1,015 million. Most of this growth came from the companies serving the back end semiconductor markets (ECT and Alphasem) and from new technology requirements in solder paste management and soddering (DEK and Vitronics Soltec). Everett Charles Technologies (ECT) had an excellent year. Sales increased 62% while earnings increased 129%. ECT acquired the test handling company Rasco GmbH in June 2004. Rasco contributed approximately 16% of the overall growth in sales and 35% of the growth in earnings. All areas of ECT performed well, in particular all of its divisions serving the back end semiconductor markets and its Probe division, although business activity fell off considerably during the fourth quarter. Universal Instruments saw an increase in both sales and profits over 2003. Universals second half roll out of new products is beginning to see market acceptance in competitive situations although margin improvement is still a challenge. There still remain some transition challenges for 2005, but year end activity indicates a potential for growing market share. DEK reported a strong year with sales increases of 50%, resulting in an earnings increase of 352%. Even with the strong growth, the strengthening of the UK currency had a negative impact on its margins as a significant portion of its operating costs are in the United Kingdom. DEK continues to focus on increasing its recurring revenue base of consumable products stencils, spare parts and other process support products. Vitronics Soltec performed very well in 2004. Sales and earnings not only grew 67% and 425%, respectively, but exceeded the record sales and earnings level of 2000. Vitronics Soltec is gaining market share due to its leadership role in lead free soldering, strong market acceptance of its selective soldering machines, and its product breadth that addresses the specific needs of the North American, European and Asian markets. Despite the significant fall off in the integrated circuit segment of the die attach equipment market during the second half of 2004, Alphasem was able to expand its business in the memory, chip attach and special application segments, resulting in sales growth of 75% and earnings improvement of 106% over the prior year. The acquisition of SSE GmbH in June 2004 has increased Alphasems ability to serve special applications. OK International reported a 20% increase in sales, and a 9% operating margin, up from a 1.5% margin in 2003. The improvement is in part due to it having completed the restructuring of its domestic operations into a 25 single manufacturing facility in southern California, further development of its China manufacturing platform and roll out of a new low cost soldering system. Hover Davis increased sales 49% and had positive earnings for the current year compared to a small loss in 2003. This growth was attributed primarily to its circuit assembly feeders. Though not contributing significantly this year, label feeders and direct die feeders are expected to increase their contribution to the sales and earnings of Hover Davis in 2005. SPECIALTY ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS (SEC) TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 2003 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS, UNAUDITED) Net sales............................................. $257,168 $211,575 22% Earnings.............................................. 15,637 7,289 115% Operating margins..................................... 6.1% 3.4% Bookings.............................................. 260,661 221,145 18% Book to Bill.......................................... 1.01 1.05 Backlog............................................... 70,771 53,074 33% In Technologies SEC companies, sales for the year were $257.2 million compared to $211.6 million last year, an increase of 21.6%. Excluding 2004 acquisitions and divestitures, sales were up 11.1% with stronger demand from communication equipment customers, which peaked in the second quarter of 2004. Earnings improved significantly to $15.6 million compared to $7.3 million last year. During the first half of 2004, SEC margins showed continuous improvement over 2003, but peaked in the second quarter. The decline in shipments during the second half of 2004, the downsizing charges at some companies, and high insurance charges resulted in second half margins of only 4%. Cost reduction/containment, strong sales/product management and integration activities are the areas of focus for management entering 2005. Vectron reported an increase in sales of 31% for the year inclusive of acquisition and divestiture activities. Excluding the impact of these activities, Vectron saw double digit sales growth. Vectrons earnings for the year increased by 57% compared to 2003 mostly from the revenue gains on the old Vectron business. In September 2004, Vectron completed the acquisition of Corning Frequency Control. This acquisition strengthens Vectrons position in the precision frequency generation and control industry (primarily wireless telecom customers) by expanding Vectrons product offerings and capabilities to provide custom engineered solutions to customers. The capacitor companies, Novacap and Dielectric, recorded a combined sales increase of 22%. Sales of the capacitor companies were enhanced by the acquisition of Voltronics in May 2004. Voltronics primarily serves the medical imaging market which remained strong through the second half of 2004, offsetting the weakness experienced by Novacap and Dielectric from communication equipment customers. However, pricing pressure from customers in Asia and the impact of non recurring insurance charges led to an overall decline in earnings at the capacitor companies. K&L Microwave posted a loss in 2004, down from the loss realized in 2003, but still reflective of an organization and structure that had not been adequately sized for current business levels. Operational realignment charges impacted 2004 earnings in the third quarter. K&L posted a profit in the fourth quarter as a result of this realignment. Dow Key, which has a strong military and aerospace business, ended the year with an 9% earnings gain on flat sales. The company experienced strong bookings in the second half of 2004, which boosted its backlog going into 2005. 26 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in the public disclosures of the Company, including information regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. The Company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conform to GAAP and are consistently applied. Valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the Company. Primary areas where the financial information of Dover is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions and the application of judgment include the following areas. Revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectibility is reasonably assured and d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving non essential installation obligations are those which can generally be completed in a short period of time, at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to the Company and in many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered product, revenues are deferred until installation is complete. In a limited number of revenue transactions, other post shipment obligations such as training and customer acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenues are deferred until the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance has been confirmed. Service revenues are recognized and earned when services are performed and are not significant to any period presented. Allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances. Estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses, adjusting for current economic conditions and, in some cases, evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. The establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances. Though Dover considers these balances adequate and proper, changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the Company operates could have a material effect on reserve balances required. In times of rapid market decline, such as affected a number of Technologies companies in 2001 and 2002, reserve balances need to be adjusted in response to these unusual circumstances. Inventory for the majority of the Companys subsidiaries, including all international subsidiaries and the Technologies segment, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first in, first out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is stated at cost, determined on the last in, first out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the Company to properly value inventory. Technologies companies tend to experience higher levels of inventory value fluctuations, particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time. Occasionally, the Company will establish restructuring reserves at an operation in accordance with appropriate accounting principles. These reserves, for both severance and exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though Dover believes that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts. Dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines (including SFAS No. 142) for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value. Dovers assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when there is a significant change in 27 circumstances. The Company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to these valuations. The valuation of Dovers pension and other post retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets/liabilities. These assumptions include discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used in Dovers pension reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to assure that they accurately account for Dovers future pension obligations. Changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on Dovers pension expenses and related funding requirements. Dovers expected long term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns and portfolio allocation. Dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal, state and international issues that are currently unresolved. The Company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved. Valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations, changes in tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates and the Companys future taxable income levels. Dover has significant accruals and reserves related to its risk management program. These accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability. The Company estimates losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions, Dovers experience, and relevant industry data. Dover considers the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and Company experience. Dover has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both the operating company and corporate levels. A significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify Dovers ultimate exposure in these matters. The valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to assure that Dover is properly reserved. Reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues. While Dover believes that the current level of reserves is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations. The Company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair value less costs to sell. These estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale. The adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Management assesses the Companys liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, adequacy of commercial paper and available bank lines of credit and the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position, with enough liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing the capital structure on a short and long term basis. 28 The following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS 2004 2003 (IN THOUSANDS, UNAUDITED) Cash flows provided by operating activities................. $ 597,447 $ 577,366 Cash flows (used in) investing activities................... (524,853) (435,238) Cash flows (used in) financing activities................... (100,950) (98,281) Cash flow provided from operating activities during 2004 were up 4.2% compared to 2003. Increases in cash flows from operations were primarily driven by increased net earnings of $119.9 million in 2004, while $104.6 million in tax refunds were received in 2003. Cash used in investing activities for 2004 rose to $524.9 million from the prior year, reflecting an increase in acquisition activity from the prior year. The acquisition expenditures for 2004 were $506.1 million compared to $362.1 million in 2003 as the Company completed eight new purchases. The Company is hopeful that 2005 acquisition activity will be consistent with the 2004 level but that will depend largely upon the availability and pricing of appropriate acquisition candidates. Capital expenditures of $107.4 million for the year were $11.0 million higher than in 2003. Capital expenditures during 2004 and 2003 were funded by internal cash flow. Capital expenditures for 2005 are expected to increase over 2004 levels. Cash used in financing activities during 2004 and 2003 were essentially flat. Dividends paid of $126.1 million in 2004 were the primary use of the cash for financing activities in 2004. Cash used in financing activities during 2003 primarily reflected a net $13.5 million increase of debt and dividend payments of $115.5 million. During 2004, Dover repaid approximately $9 million of long term debt and had $65 million of commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2004. In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow, the Company also measures free cash flow. Management believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions and repay debt. Dovers free cash flow for 2004 and 2003 remained essentially flat including a large tax refund in 2003. The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow with cash flows from operating activities: TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, FREE CASH FLOW 2004 2003 (IN THOUSANDS, UNAUDITED) Cash flow provided by operating activities.................. $ 597,447 $ 573,366 Less: Capital expenditures.................................. (107,434) (96,400) Dividends to stockholders................................. $(126,060) (115,504) Free cash flow.............................................. $ 363,953 $ 361,462 The Companys cash and cash equivalents decreased 3% during 2004 to $358 million at December 31, 2004, compared to $370 million at December 31, 2003. Adjusted working capital (calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) increased from December 31, 2003 by $220.9 million or 20.0% to $1,324 million, primarily driven by increases in receivables of $165.1 million to $912.7 million and increases in inventory of $136.4 million to $775.7 million, offset by increases in payables of $80.6 million to $364.4 million. Excluding the impact of acquisitions on working capital of $105.4 million and changes in foreign currency of $33.2 million, working capital increased by $82.1 million or 7.4% from December 31, 2003. Increases in receivables were driven by acquisitions of $49.8 million, increases due to foreign currency fluctuations of $31.1 million and increased sales activity. Inventory balances increases were driven by acquisitions of $70.5 million, increases due to foreign currency 29 fluctuations of $18.7 million and increases due to operational efforts to build up inventory for the ramping up of production, particularly in the Technologies segment. Increases in accounts payable were driven by acquisitions of $15.0 million, foreign currency fluctuations of $16.6 million and a concerted effort by management to better align the payable cycle with the Companys cash receipts cycle. Other assets and deferred charges remained essentially flat and were $195.7 million as of December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, the Companys net property, plant, and equipment amounted to $756.7 million compared to $717.9 million at the end of the preceding year. The increase in net property, plant and equipment reflected acquisitions of $63.2 million, capital expenditures of $107.4 million and increases related to foreign currency fluctuation of $17.4 million, offset by depreciation. Goodwill and intangible assets increased $305.1 million and $154.2 million, respectively. Increases were primarily driven by acquisitions which resulted in goodwill of $278.7 million and intangible assets of $158.6 million and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of $26.4 million, offset by amortization. The aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities increased from $330.8 million net deferred tax liability at the beginning of the year to $429.7 million at year end. This resulted primarily from the increase in deferrals related to intangible assets ($278.7 acquisition related), offset by increases in deferred tax assets from accrued compensation. Current accrued expenses increased $49.5 million to $471.4 million at December 31, 2004. Increases during 2004 related to increased accrued compensation and employee benefits of $30.3 million, increased insurance accruals of $18.0 million and increases in other accrued expenses of $.7 million. Retained earnings increased from $3,342.0 million at the beginning of 2004 to $3,628.7 million at December 31, 2004. The $286.7 million increase resulted from 2004 net earnings of $412.8 million, reduced by cash dividends which aggregated $126.1 million. Stockholders equity increased from $2,742.7 million to $3,118.7 million. The $376.0 million increase resulted mainly from the increase in retained earnings and increased equity adjustments related to foreign currency translation of $75.5 million. Dovers consolidated pension benefit obligation increased by $33.2 million in 2004. The increase was due principally to plan amendments related to increased participation in the supplemental benefit plan. In addition, plan assets increased $15.5 million due to gains on plan investments during the year which were partially offset by payout of benefits. During 2004, plan amendments created an increase in the benefit obligation of $26.0 million. Due to the decrease in the net funded status of the plans and the increase in the amortization of unrecognized losses, it is estimated that pension expense will increase from $15.9 to approximately $24.9 million in 2005. The Company anticipates discretionary contributions to its pension benefit plans of $32 million in 2005, including supplemental benefits. The Company utilizes the total debt and net debt to total capitalization calculations to assess its overall financial leverage and believes the calculations are useful to its stockholders for the same reasons. The total debt level of $1,092.3 million as of December 31, 2004 increased $24.7 million from December 31, 2003 as a result of drawing down approximately $25 million more of short term commercial paper. As of December 31, 2004, net debt of $734.5 million represented 19.1% of total capital, a decrease of 1.1 percentage points from December 31, 2003. Borrowings under the Companys commercial paper program were minimal throughout 2004, never exceeding $65 million during the year. Commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $65 million and $40 million, respectively. In November 2005, the Company is scheduled to repay $250 million of long term debt. 30 The following table reconciles net debt and net debt to total capitalization: DECEMBER 31, DECEMBER 31, NET DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION RATIO 2004 2003 (IN THOUSANDS, UNAUDITED) Current maturities of long term debt........................ $ 252,677 $ 3,266 Commercial paper and other short term debt.................. 86,588 60,403 Long term debt.............................................. 753,063 1,003,915 Total debt.................................................. 1,092,328 1,067,584 Less: Cash, equivalents and marketable securities........... 357,803 371,397 Net debt.................................................... 734,525 696,187 Add: Stockholders equity................................... 3,118,682 2,742,671 Total capitalization........................................ $3,853,207 $3,438,858 Net debt to total capitalization............................ 19.1% 20.2% On September 8, 2004, the Company entered into a $600 million five year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of fifteen banks. The Credit Agreement replaced an existing 364 day credit facility and a 3 year credit facility in the same aggregate principal amount and on substantially the same terms and is intended to be used primarily as liquidity back up for the Companys commercial paper program. As described above, the Credit Agreement has a five year term, whereas the prior facilities had respective terms of 364 days and three years and would otherwise have expired in October 2004 and October 2005, respectively. The Company has not drawn down any loan under the Credit Agreement, and does not anticipate doing so, and as of December 31, 2004, had commercial paper outstanding in the principal amount of $65 million. At the Companys election, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a Eurodollar or alternative currency rate based on LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.19% to 0.60% (subject to adjustment based on the rating accorded the Companys senior unsecured debt by S&P and Moodys), or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined in the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company will pay a facility fee and a utilization fee in certain circumstances, as described in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement imposes various restrictions on the Company that are substantially identical to those in the replaced facilities. Among other things, the Credit Agreement generally requires the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.5 to 1. The Company is and has been in compliance with this covenant and the ratio was 12.6 to 1 as of December 31, 2004, and 9.4 to 1 as of December 31, 2003. The Company established a Canadian Credit Facility in November of 2002 with the Bank of Nova Scotia. Under the terms of this Credit Agreement, the Company has a Canadian (CAD) $30 million bank credit availability and has the option to borrow in either Canadian Dollars or U.S. Dollars. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the outstanding borrowings under this facility were approximately CAD $21 million and U.S. $17 million, respectively. The covenants and interest rates under this facility match those of the primary $600 million revolving credit facility. The Canadian Credit Facility was renewed for an additional year prior to its expiration date of November 25, 2004, and now expires on November 22, 2005. The Company intends to replace the Canadian Credit Facility on or before its expiration date. The primary purpose of this agreement is to facilitate borrowings in Canada for efficient cash and tax planning. The Company may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes. Interest rate swaps are agreements to exchange fixed and variable rate payments based on notional principal amounts. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had three interest rate swaps outstanding for a total notional amount of $150.0 million, designated as fair value hedges of part of the $150.0 million 6.25% Notes due on June 1, 2008, to exchange fixed rate interest for variable rate interest. There was no hedge ineffectiveness as of December 31, 2004 and the aggregate fair value of these interest rate swaps of $0.7 million determined through market quotation was reported in other assets and long term debt. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company terminated an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $50.0 million for an immaterial gain, which is being recognized over the remaining term of the debt issuance. 31 This interest rate swap was designated as a fair value hedge of the 6.25% Notes, due June 1, 2008. During the second quarter of 2004, Dover entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $50.0 million, at more favorable rates to replace the interest rate swap terminated during the first quarter. This interest rate swap is designated as a fair value hedge of the 6.25% Notes due June 1, 2008. The swap is designated in a foreign currency and exchanges fixed rate interest for variable rate interest, which also hedges a portion of the Companys net investment in foreign operations. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, one interest rate swap with a notional amount of $50.0 million was terminated with no material impact to the Company. Dovers long term debt instruments had a book value of $1,005.7 million on December 31, 2004 and a fair value of approximately $1,093.0 million. On December 31, 2003, the Companys long term debt instruments had a book value of $1,007.2 million and a fair value of approximately $1,103.0 million. Management is not aware of any potential impairment to the Companys liquidity, and the Company is in compliance with all its long term debt covenants. It is anticipated that in 2005 any funding requirements above cash generated from operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper or, depending upon market conditions, through the issuance of long term debt or some combination of the two. The Companys credit ratings are as follows for the years ended December 31: 2004 2003 SHORT TERM LONG TERM SHORT TERM LONG TERM Moodys..................................

Acquisition spending would increase company debt but management anticipates that the debt to capital ratio will remain generally consistent with historical levels. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the Companys various cash flow requirements, including acquisition spending and pension funding as needed. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," which is effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The standard replaces EITF Issue 94 3 and requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred, as defined in SFAS No. 146, rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The provisions of SFAS 146 are to be applied prospectively. The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 146 was immaterial to the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. In November of 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of 32 Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34." FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of FASB Statement No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," relating to the guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after December 15, 2002 and have been incorporated into the footnotes. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantors year end. FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. The effect of the adoption of FIN 45 was immaterial to the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. The Company has also adopted the disclosure requirements of FIN 45. In December of 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of SFAS 123," which is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 regarding certain disclosure requirements which have been incorporated into the footnotes. This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. It also amends the disclosure provisions of that Statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation. Finally, this Statement amends APB Opinion No. 28, "Interim Financial Reporting," to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 148 had no impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. In January 2003, FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" was issued. FIN 46 provides guidance on consolidating variable interest entities and applies immediately to variable interests created after January 31, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB revised and superseded FIN 46 with the issuance of FIN 46R in order to address certain implementation issues that were adopted the first reporting period ending after March 15, 2004. The interpretation requires variable interest entities to be consolidated if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit an entity to finance its activities without support from other parties or the equity investors lack certain specified characteristics. The effect of the adoption of FIN 46 was immaterial to the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 applies specifically to a number of financial instruments that companies have historically presented within their financial statements either as equity or between the liabilities section and the equity section, rather than as liabilities. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 150 was immaterial to the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (SAB 104), Revenue Recognition. SAB 104 supersedes SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, to include the guidance from Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 00 21 "Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables." The adoption of SAB 104 did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2003, the FASB published a revision to SFAS No. 132 "Employers Disclosure about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106." SFAS No. 132R requires additional disclosures to those in the original SFAS No. 132 about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. The provisions of SFAS No. 132 remain in effect until the provisions of SFAS No. 132R are adopted. SFAS No. 132R is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after December 15, 33 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 132R did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106 2 (FSP 106 2), "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003," which supersedes FSP 106 1. FSP 106 2 provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act") for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits. It also requires certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the Act. This FSP is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. The effect of adoption has not been material to the Companys results of operations, cash flow or financial position. In November of 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs," an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 "Inventory Pricing." SFAS No. 151 adopts the IASB view related to inventories that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs should be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are applicable to inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will be immaterial to the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. In December of 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, "Share Based Payment." SFAS No. 123R revises previously issued SFAS 123 "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and amends SFAS Statement No. 95 "Statement of Cash Flows." SFAS No. 123R requires the Company to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation for the interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The share based award must be classified as equity or as a liability and the compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the award at the date of the grant. In addition, liability awards will be re measured at fair value each reporting period. The effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will not be materially different from the pro forma results included in Note 1 Stock Based Compensation. 2003 COMPARED WITH 2002 SUMMARY Sales for 2003 of $4,413.3 million were up $359.7 million or 9% from 2002, primarily driven by increases of $194.8 million at Technologies and $109.8 million at Resources. Technologies sales were impacted by recovery in the electronics industry. Resources sales increased due to improved market conditions and the acquisition of Warn Industries. Diversifieds sales increased $52.5 million, while Industries sales were essentially flat. Sales would have increased 4.6% to $4,238.1 million if 2002 foreign currency translation rates were applied to 2003 results. Acquisitions completed during 2003 contributed $67.7 million to sales and contributed gross profit of $18.4 million. Gross profit of $1,520.4 million in 2003 represented a 14% improvement compared to $1,330.9 million in 2002. Gross profit for 2002 included approximately $12.0 million of inventory provisions primarily incurred by Technologies and, to a lesser extent, Diversified. Gross profit margins of 34.5% for 2003 compared to 32.8% for 2002 and were positively impacted by increased volume levels and the prior years operational realignment and restructuring. Selling and administrative expenses for 2003 were $1,076.7 million or 24% of net sales, compared to $996.2 million or 25% of net sales in 2002. Selling and administrative expenses for 2002 included approximately $28.7 million of restructuring provisions primarily incurred by Technologies and to a lesser extent Industries and Diversified. Operating profit of $443.8 million for 2003 increased $109.0 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the 9% increase in revenues, benefits from the Companys restructuring programs undertaken during 2002 and 2001 and slightly improved global economic conditions. Operating profit margin for 2003 was 10.1% compared to 8.3% for 2002. Net interest expense decreased 4% to $62.2 million for 2003, compared to $64.8 million for 2002. The primary reasons for the decrease in net interest expense were the decrease in long term debt during the year of 34 approximately $26 million, higher levels of interest bearing cash equivalents, and interest income related to the Companys outstanding interest rate swaps on some of its long term debt. Other net expenses for 2003 were $9.7 million and primarily related to foreign exchange losses of $6.2 million and legal settlements at the Industries and Resources segments. Other expenses of $6.6 million for 2002 primarily related to foreign exchange losses of $6.0 million. The foreign exchange losses in both 2003 and 2002 primarily relate to appreciation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. Dovers effective 2003 tax rate for continuing operations was 23.3%, compared to 2002s rate of 21.1%. The low effective tax rate for both years is largely due to the continuing benefit from tax credit programs such as those for R&E combined with the benefit from U.S. export programs, lower effective foreign tax rates from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the recognition of certain capital loss benefits. Net earnings from continuing operations for 2003 were $285.2 million or $1.40 per diluted share compared to $207.8 million or $1.02 per diluted share from continuing operations in 2002. For 2003, net earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle were $292.9 million or $1.44 per diluted share, including $7.7 million or $.04 per diluted share in earnings from discontinued operations, compared to $171.8 million or $.84 per diluted share for 2002, which included $36.1 million or $.18 per diluted share in losses from discontinued operations. Discontinued operations earnings for 2003 were $7.7 million compared to losses of $36.1 million in 2002. During 2003, in connection with the completion of a federal income tax audit and commercial resolution of other issues, the Company adjusted certain reserves, established in connection with the sales of previously discontinued operations and recorded a gain on the sales of discontinued operations net of tax of $16.6 million, and additional tax benefits of $5.1 million related to losses previously incurred on sales of business. These amounts were offset by charges of $13.6 million, net of tax, to reduce discontinued businesses to their estimated fair value, and a loss on the sale of discontinued operations net of tax of $6.0 million related to contingent liabilities from previously discontinued operations. Total losses from discontinued operations in 2002 and 2001 primarily relate to charges to reduce discontinued businesses to their estimated fair value. Please refer to Note 7 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. For 2002, the impact of the adoption of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," resulted in a net loss of $121.3 million. The adoption resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $345.1 million ($293.0 million, net of tax, or $1.44 diluted earnings per share). The adoption of the standard also discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective January 1, 2002. DIVERSIFIED TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS) Net sales........................................ $1,168,256 $1,115,776 5% Earnings......................................... 131,867 127,454 3% Operating margins................................ 11.3% 11.4% Bookings......................................... 1,161,012 1,082,316 7% Book to Bill..................................... 0.99 0.97 Backlog.......................................... 334,349 331,234 1% Diversifieds earnings increased 3% in 2003 on a 5% sales increase, as capital equipment markets remained soft. The earnings increase was achieved mainly through operational improvements, volume and cost reduction efforts. Record segment bookings improved 7% over the prior year. Hill Phoenix, SWEP and Belvac accounted for a large portion of the earnings gain, which was somewhat offset by declines at Waukesha, Performance Motorsports, Graphics Microsystems and Crenlo. In 2003, Hill Phoenix reported its second consecutive record year, setting new highs in sales, earnings and cash flow, again leading Diversified in each of these three categories. Despite its overall market being down, 35 Hill Phoenix benefited from growth at several of its largest customers as well as securing new key accounts. Hill Phoenix has been able to outperform its competition and gain market share in recent years, due largely to industry leading product innovation and strong customer service. The improvement was across all its business units, as Display Cases, Refrigeration Systems, National Cooler and EDP all showed a year over year earnings increase. A three point operating margin improvement was achieved, largely the result of leveraging value added pricing and productivity gains. All growth in 2003 and 2002 was internal, as there were no acquisitions impacting results. Sargents earnings were slightly down compared to the prior year, as strong military business and a successful add on acquisition were offset by the extended commercial aerospace downturn. Record bookings improved 32% over the prior year, led by the Marine Division being awarded a large U.S. military order for submarine ship sets. Margins fell in 2003 largely due to an unfavorable sales mix and the decision to invest in several development programs. The Sonic business unit was hurt by continued airline cutbacks and a significant reduction in production at their largest customer. Sargent Aerospace Canada, a manufacturer of airplane components in Montreal, Canada, was acquired in April and produced positive results throughout the year. Performance Motorsports earnings declined for the first time since being acquired by Diversified in 1998, due to several production issues and a weak powersports market. Performance Motorsports struggled throughout the year integrating its December 2002 acquisition of Chambon, where volumes declined and significant losses resulted. Perfect Bore absorbed high production costs and also reported a loss, due to lingering production problems resulting from internalizing a key manufacturing process that had previously been outsourced. Performance Motorsports two largest business units, Wiseco and JE Pistons, both had steady years and reported sales and earnings slightly ahead of prior year. After four consecutive quarters of unfavorable comparisons to the prior year, Performance Motorsports saw order intake increase in the fourth quarter and earnings improved over the prior year. Despite market softness in 2003, Performance Motorsports maintained its market share and was well positioned to improve as its markets recovered. SWEP exceeded prior year bookings, sales, and earnings in every quarter in 2003. Though the year started slow, order activity improved in both its heat pump and boiler markets and was very strong in the last nine months of the year. Production capacity was increased with both capital investments and productivity programs to meet the growing demand. Backlog at the end of 2003 was 67% above last year. Earnings were up 60% on a 24% increase in sales, driven by cost reduction, favorable currency rates, and a robust market. Its new central warehouse in Germany was fully consolidated in 2003, which drove down lead times and reduced selling and administrative expenses. Though the price of stainless steel dropped slightly late in the year, potential increases in metal prices threatened to affect near term margins. In 2003, Belvac reported its highest earnings in five years, improving 64% over the prior year. As the only independent global supplier of can forming equipment, Belvacs recent success was in the non U.S. market, especially Russia and Australia, where can manufacturing and consumer use is growing. A significant portion of its business includes spares and retrofits that improve the productivity of its customers equipment. Further investment and advancement in its plastic container equipment was beginning to complement its can forming business, and opening up new opportunities for growth. In 2003, Belvac began the process of establishing a warehouse, service center and related supply chains in the Czech Republic. Waukesha had a strong finish to the year, but still recorded a 15% earnings decline on a 6% drop in revenue. The weak power generation market continued to negatively impact the Bearings division, and costs to close its South Carolina facility further reduced earnings. This was the third time in two years that Bearings down sized its capacity due to the soft market demand. On a positive note, the Magnetics Bearing group had a record year in sales and earnings as project development work began to show a payback. After a slow start to the year, the Hydratight Sweeney division had a solid comeback in the last three quarters on strong Torque and Service business. The Tension business was down for the year, though bookings in its Oil & Gas markets improved in the fourth quarter setting a good foundation for 2004. Central Research Labs sales and earnings were significantly down as orders for a number of large nuclear waste clean up projects were delayed into 2004. CRL continues to develop the use of their products with large OEMs in the pharmaceutical markets. 36 Tranter PHE set new bookings and sales records in 2003, though earnings dropped below 2002 by 6%. Marine bookings came back strong especially with shipyards in South Korea. Another solid contributor was the North America ethanol market that is being driven by investments in alternative energy sources. Favorable currency translations due to the weakening of the dollar and higher Eurasian business also increased reported sales. Investments were made in the India operations to add manufacturing and engineering capability to make welded products for the Eurasia market. This facility attained the highest quality approvals for its industry in 2003: PED (Pressure Equipment Directive) for Europe, and ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) for North America. Significant gains in productivity, reduced lead times and on time delivery in the Swedish manufacturing operations were also achieved. Mark Andy earnings declined 12% on slightly lower sales, as cost reduction efforts did not offset weaker gross margins. An unfavorable product mix, production start up problems on a new label press, and higher warranty expenses caused lower earnings in the St. Louis operations. Results improved at year end with fourth quarter earnings contributing over half of the years total earnings. The package printing equipment market further weakened in 2003 but began to see some firming late in the year. After a short rebound in label press orders in 2002, bookings declined 13% in 2003. Comco packaging press orders were flat in 2003, although 2003 ended with its best quarterly bookings performance since the acquisition in early 2001. Improvements in sales coverage, upgrades in sales personnel, and worldwide sales organization changes were made to strengthen its position. Both U.S. operations received ISO certification and lean manufacturing initiatives continued to drive improvement. Crenlo followed 2002s substantial turnaround with lower earnings despite slightly increased volume. Earnings were down due to an unfavorable sales mix, rising medical, natural gas and wage costs, and costs associated with projects that will generate future revenue. The unfavorable sales mix is attributable to a decline in the specialty enclosure business, which has been negatively impacted by a large customers restructuring following a merger. The South Carolina facility continued to be hurt by under leveraged fixed costs and high overtime, resulting in the inability to reach consistent production levels. On a positive note, cost reductions and productivity gains achieved in 2003 positioned Crenlo to capitalize on higher volumes. Increased order activity in the fourth quarter by several key customers provided cautious optimism for 2004, as shipment levels for the first quarter were projected to be higher. Graphics Microsystems (GMI) sales grew 3% over 2002, despite the third consecutive year of a decline in the printing industry. The ColorQuick product set a new sales record and required a re alignment of its business resource and processes. GMI decided to target large growth opportunities and shifted its business model from serving only small to medium size printers in the aftermarket to a focus on large printers and the high end new press OEM market. 2003 earnings were negatively affected by necessary investments in R&D, price concessions, and technical service to pursue this new business. SWF completed a year of transition, reporting breakeven results as several key managers were replaced and plant consolidations were finalized. Facilities in Florida and Washington were consolidated into the California operation, resulting in overhead cost reduction and business simplification going forward. Several large warranty issues were resolved in 2003, and new warranty claims steadily declined throughout the year. Positive strides were made operationally, including the introduction of laser machining capabilities, formally establishing preferred suppliers, restructuring the sales and engineering organizations and the introduction of integrated work groups. The internal improvements achieved in 2003, SWF to be more externally focused in 2004. 37 INDUSTRIES TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS) Net sales........................................ $1,039,930 $1,034,714 1% Earnings......................................... 121,200 137,547 (12)% Operating margins................................ 11.7% 13.3% Bookings......................................... 1,105,046 995,552 11% Book to Bill..................................... 1.06 0.96 Backlog.......................................... 201,866 119,881 68% Industries earned 12% less on essentially flat sales, reflecting plant closing costs and margin pressure from earlier in the year. Nevertheless, quarterly sales and earnings improved sequentially as the year progressed. Fourth quarter results topped the previous three quarters, reflecting market share increases and improved market conditions across the majority of companies. The biggest contributors to earnings increases were PDQ, with strong new product sales and Tipper Tie which benefited from strong overseas performance, capitalizing on the opening of the Eastern European markets. 2003 was a challenging year for Heil Environmental. Earnings were down 30% as its market declined over 20%, resulting in the lowest industry volume since 1997. Municipal markets remained weak and pricing pressures continued. Environmental closed down a facility and consolidated their two parts businesses. Performance increased in the second half, as both the third and fourth quarters showed favorable comparisons to prior year, and full year bookings and backlog were up reflecting favorable year over year comparisons. Overseas, Heil was able to leverage a strong UK market while increasing share. Rotary Lifts 2003 sales were enhanced by the May 2003 acquisition of Blitz, a German lift manufacturer. However, integrating the existing Rotary Lift Italian operations into Blitz negatively impacted earnings. North American sales fell slightly as the industry declined and competitive pressures led to contracting margins. For the full year, Rotary Lifts sales grew 5% and earnings were flat. However, a number of new products were introduced in the latter half of the year, resulting in sales growth of over 8% in the second half. Backlog was up over 50%, leading to optimism heading into 2004. Industry declines impacted Heil Trailer, as the U.S. tank trailer markets decreased for the fourth consecutive year. Reacting to the contraction, Trailer closed two facilities during 2003. Despite continued price competition, Trailer was able to grow share in both the petroleum and dry bulk markets. Business began to pick up later in the year, as fourth quarter revenues in 2003 were 16% above 2002 levels. Military shipments began in earnest in the fourth quarter of 2003, and will account for an additional $20.0 million of sales in 2004, the result of a military contract awarded to Heil in late 2003. Kalyn Siebert, a Heil Trailer subsidiary, benefited from this strong military volume as revenues almost doubled for the year. Tipper Ties European operations achieved record sales driven by strong performance in Eastern Europe. Earnings improved 21% on a sales increase of 9%. Alpina, a 2000 acquisition, surpassed 2003s record results as it continued to expand its product line into new geographic regions. The U.S. business continued to be challenged amid a weak capital equipment market and continued pricing pressure. Marathons sales and margins declined three percentage points in 2003 which were primarily the result of pricing pressures driven by market weakness. The waste equipment market was down, adjusting to the overcapacity of production in the industry, ultimately leading to price erosion. As a result, Marathon closed a facility while reducing headcount by over 10%. Strength in their Recycling Systems Group helped stem the tide, and was viewed as a key growth area for 2004. Triton, which saw significant improvement in 2002, delivered record revenues in 2003, although earnings were relatively flat because of new product start up costs. Unit sales were up over 10% in a flat U.S. market, resulting in share gains again in 2003. These gains were attributable to the success of the 9100 product line, which was introduced in mid 2002 and focuses on the broadest segment of the cash dispenser market. It represented more than two thirds of 2003 unit sales volume. Tritons strong new product focus continued in 2003, as two key products were introduced late in the year. The FT5000 is a through the wall model aimed at the financial institution market, while the RL5000 is aimed principally at the retail market. Internationally, 38 both the UK and Canadian markets remained strong, and market share increased in both of these key focus regions. As 2003 ended, Triton expected to enter additional countries in 2004 and international markets accounted for approximately 35% of unit sales. PDQs record fourth quarter results contributed to solid year over year gains. Earnings increased 22% while sales increased 12%. An increase in major oil and gas station business coupled with continued strong investor demand drove the late year surge. Market share continued to increase, although competitors were beginning to have an impact on the low end market. A major driver in 2002 was the introduction and customer acceptance of several new products, one of which, a higher end Laser Wash, accounted for over 30% of sales in the fourth quarter in 2003. Declining tax revenues for most states, counties and municipalities led to a slowdown in DI Foodservices institutional foodservice equipment market, continuing a trend which began in 2002. However, both Groen and Randell were able to grow market share during 2003. There was a pickup in chain restaurant sales, as many experienced strong same store sales growth in the later half of 2003. Institutional markets will continue to struggle, although renovation and replacements have shown some growth in 2003 and are expected to continue into 2004. Consolidation costs experienced in 2003 to bring the Groen, Randell, and Avtec businesses under the DI Foodservice umbrella were expected to positively impact margins in 2004. Kurz Kasch rebounded from a challenging 2002 as revenues and earnings increased in 2003 over 10% driven by the successful integration of business/product lines acquired in late 2002. In addition, Kurz Kasch purchased Wabash Magnetics, a manufacturer of actuators and sensors, in December of 2003. This acquisition positioned Kurz Kasch to expand into the medical and irrigation markets, among others. Dovatechs performance in 2003 benefited from strength in both the Chiller and Laser businesses. A pickup in semiconductor demand drove the Laser business performance while strong sales into the medical market resulted in the Chiller business growing over 18%. Strength in Chief Automotives computerized measuring products was more than offset by market contraction in the frame straightening market. Somero partially offset significant market weakness with the successful introduction of the "Copperhead," a walk behind laser screed, which accounted for over 60% of unit sales in 2003. RESOURCES TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS) Net sales........................................... $982,658 $872,898 13% Earnings............................................ 136,851 124,380 10% Operating margins................................... 13.9% 14.2% Bookings............................................ 990,057 867,155 14% Book to Bill........................................ 1.01 0.99 Backlog............................................. 104,362 70,876 47% Resources 2003 earnings increased by 10% on a sales increase of 13% due to strong increases from the Energy Products Group, De Sta Co Industries and the OPW companies, and the acquisition of Warn Industries. All twelve Resources companies increased bookings versus 2002 and ended the year with slightly higher backlogs overall. Warn, which was acquired on October 1, 2003, was a significant driver of Resources revenue and earnings growth, even after the impact of purchase accounting. Warn is a leader in the recreational winch business, both for all terrain vehicles and four wheel drive vehicles. In addition, Warn is a leading manufacturer of all wheel drive and four wheel drive disconnect technology providing products that enhance fuel economy and improve performance of these vehicles. The continued flow of new products and the entrance into new markets should drive continued growth in the business. The Energy Products Group results include Quartzdyne, which was added to the group in 2003. Overall, the year was extremely positive with an earnings increase of 41% on a sales increase of 15% great operating leverage. The core products of Alberta Oil Tool and Norris achieved sales and margin increases, both domestically and globally. Both of these units had record profits. Ferguson Beauregard and Norriseal had 39 greatly improved earnings on relatively small increases in sales. Quartzdyne was the exception in the group. While continuing to achieve very respectable earnings, Quartzdyne did not benefit from increased activity in the energy sector. However, they did not experience any loss of market share and the company continued to invest in new products to allow expansion of its served markets. OPW Fueling Components had a very strong 2003, leveraging earnings 35% on a sales increase of 8%. OPW achieved solid business growth from its "newly certified" products for compliance with the "Enhanced Vapor Recovery" requirements. In addition, the business continued to rationalize capacity in North America, while at the same time opening a new facility in China and expanding its presence in Brazil with the opening of a larger manufacturing facility. Significant benefits were achieved from global sourcing and expansion of a well disciplined Six Sigma quality initiative. The full integration of the EMCO Electronics acquisition into the OPW Fuel Management business was completed in 2003 and drove an earnings increase in that business unit. De Sta Co Industries increased earnings 23% on a sales increase of 16%. Continued focus on new product development, internal lean initiatives, and improvements in channel management provided very positive results. The German and French operations achieved significant improvement in earnings. The increased strength in the Industrial Products Group offset weakness in the electronics and U.S. automotive business segments. The pump companies, Blackmer and Wilden, experienced a number of challenges that impacted earnings in 2003, including a legal settlement and costs incurred to restructure product lines, although both companies made strides to improve their product offering and grow their business on a global basis. Wildens non U.S. sales grew 20% and were enhanced by the opening of a manufacturing facility in China, which exceeded first year plan results, and growth in their Argentina operation as that economy began to recover. Blackmer had its strongest year ever in Europe but experienced costs in the U.S. to rationalize capacity and "right size" its U.S. operations. OPW Fluid Transfer Group had a year of solid improvement across all its business units with earnings increasing 16% on a sales increase of 8%. Improvements in working capital contributed to a higher return on investment. Strong results from Midland and Europe were the drivers to better results. The global footprint for this business was expanded in 2003 with the addition of a facility in Brazil and finalization of a restructuring in Europe. C. Lee Cook benefited from right sizing in 2002, as well as from a number of management led initiatives to reduce product cost and expand its service presence. The business achieved positive earnings leverage of 15% on a modest sales increase of 4%. As the year 2003 ended, C. Lee Cook experienced improvements across all of its business units both OEM related and service related. This increase indicated continued investment in natural gas production and transmission. With demand for natural gas increasing, the Company anticipated strength in the business going forward. Texas Hydraulics experienced a challenging year as a result of continued price pressure and reduced schedules from construction equipment customers. During 2003, the business made significant investments in new products and new customer applications/prototypes. As the year 2003 closed, orders resulting from new products were strong. The business continued to implement lean concepts and selective outsourcing to improve its cost structures. Tulsa Winch was able to grow earnings 6% on a sales increase of 9%. There was very little consistency across market segments, with difficult conditions in the large crane and service crane markets being offset by strength in the petroleum, military, and marine segments. Continued efforts to leverage strengths across the group were leading to advanced new product offerings to be introduced in 2004. RPA Process Technologies experienced an extremely difficult year in 2003 with declining revenues and a full year loss resulting from depressed capital spending in the process industry coupled with significant one time charges to downsize its operations in France. Hydro Systems experienced relatively flat sales in its traditional core U.S. business but was still able to achieve a 4% earnings gain on a 5% sales increase, primarily as a result of prior investments in new products 40 and Europe. The European operations more than doubled earnings as a result of some very successful new product launches. Hydro also invested in the start up of a new facility in Brazil, which began operations during the fourth quarter of 2003 and was expected to provide full year benefits in 2004. TECHNOLOGIES TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS) Net sales........................................ $1,231,241 $1,036,472 19% Segment earnings (losses)........................ 84,763 (30,339) Operating margins................................ 6.9% (2.9)% Bookings......................................... 1,275,598 1,046,903 22% Book to Bill..................................... 1.04 1.01 Backlog.......................................... 182,427 127,752 43% Technologies 2003 sales increased to $1,231.2 million, a 19% increase over 2002. As a result of both the restructuring commenced in the fourth quarter of 2002 and increased revenues, earnings increased to $84.8 million, a $115.1 million improvement from a loss in 2002 of $30.3 million. Included in the loss for 2002 were restructuring, inventory and other charges totaling $35.2 million. The electronics industry is clearly in a recovery mode with even the telecom sector showing signs of increased equipment spending. As electronic manufacturing continued to shift to Asia, almost all of the Technologies companies improved their Asian infrastructure in sales and marketing and, at the equipment companies, in manufacturing. In addition, all of the companies continued their efforts to expand their product offering in the markets and applications they serve. Military, space, avionics, medical, automotive and other industrial applications played a greater role in 2003 than in 2002 in the Technologies businesses. CIRCUIT BOARD AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS) Net sales............................................. $731,749 $598,646 22% Segment earnings (losses)............................. 43,691 (55,722) Operating margins..................................... 6.0% (9.3)% Bookings.............................................. 760,923 615,522 24% Book to Bill.......................................... 1.04 1.03 Backlog............................................... 107,036 72,166 48% Technologies CBAT businesses reported 2003 earnings of $43.7 million versus a loss of $55.7 million in 2002. The 2002 loss included inventory, restructuring and other charges of $25.9 million. Sales increased 22% to $731.8 million while bookings increased 24% to $760.9 million. Much of this growth came from the back end semiconductor businesses, ECT and Alphasem, whose sales grew from 16% of CBAT sales in 2002 to over 22% in 2003. Universal Instruments saw a 17% increase in sales over 2002 and recorded a profit for the first time since 2000. Universal continued to invest in new products which were exhibited at the November 2003 Productronica show in Germany. Universal was expected to face significant challenges transitioning to these new products and bringing them to full commercialization in the second half of 2004. While sales at Everett Charles Technologies increased 18%, profits increased dramatically with double digit margins, after reporting a loss in 2002. The largest increase in sales occurred in the back end semiconductor test products. The test handling equipment at MultiTest and the load board and socket products at ECT reported the largest increase in sales and bookings activity. This trend was expected to continue into the beginning of 2004. 41 DEK experienced a 26% increase in sales and reported a profit for 2003. The weakening dollar impacted DEKs gross margin as much of its manufacturing remained in the UK, while sales were generally sold in U.S. dollars or U.S. dollar linked currencies. The 2002 acquisition of Acumen was integrated and provided increased levels of non machine recurring revenues. OK International reported a slight increase in sales of 4% which generated positive earnings compared to a loss in 2002. Earnings were slightly positive compared to a loss in prior years. During 2003, OK completely restructured its domestic operations by consolidating the majority of its manufacturing into a single plant in southern California. Vitronics Soltec reported a 39% increase in sales and also had a profit versus a loss in 2002. Its new products in selective soldering and its "lead free" solder knowledge leadership helped Vitronics continue to gain market share against its competitors. Alphasem reported a 103% increase in sales and positive earnings in 2003, in contrast to a loss in 2002. Alphasem serves the back end semiconductor business with die bonding equipment. Under a new President, Alphasem has restructured the companys management team, its R&D efforts, Asian sales force and logistics, and established a Chinese manufacturing organization. These efforts have had a significant impact on the improved financial results of the Company. Hover Davis, acquired in October of 2002, saw sales increase 14% on a year over year basis. Though financial performance improved over 2002, Hover Davis reported a small loss in 2003, as markets served have still not fully recovered. SPECIALTY ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS (SEC) TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (IN THOUSANDS) Net sales........................................... $211,575 $205,635 3% Segment earnings (losses)........................... 7,316 (12,070) Operating margins................................... 3.5% (5.9)% Bookings............................................ 221,145 199,255 11% Book to Bill........................................ 1.05 0.97 Backlog............................................. 53,074 42,740 24% In Technologies SEC companies, sales increased 3% over 2002, to $211.6 million. Earnings improved significantly to $7.3 million when compared to a loss of $12.1 million last year. The 2002 loss included inventory, restructuring and other charges of $9.9 million. Substantially all of this earnings growth came in the fourth quarter as the first three quarters were basically flat on a year to year comparison. During 2003, the SEC companies made considerable efforts to expand their customer base and industries served. Telecom products were a lesser portion of the overall businesses as military, space, avionics, medical, automotive and other industrial applications grew as a percent of sales. Towards the end of 2003, even telecom customers increased their spending with indications that the trend would continue into 2004. Vectron (formerly referred to as Quadrant), the largest of the SEC companies, reported an increase in sales of 5% for the year, but 23% for the fourth quarter alone. Margins improved to 10% in the fourth quarter. Earnings for the year improved by $17.4 million from a loss in 2002. Vectron continues to acquire new customers based on its technology, service and quality. K&L Microwave spent most of 2003 refocusing its business on military and industrial markets. As its base station customers consolidated their supply chains, K&L found much of its planned Asian telecom infrastructure business had diminished. Accordingly, K&L has exited all Asian manufacturing, leaving in place a sales and marketing team to respond to appropriate opportunities. This realignment of its business resulted in a loss for K&L for 2003. 42 The capacitor companies, Novacap and Dielectric, both reported increased sales, 17% and 4%, respectively. Operating margins increased to 13% and 9%, respectively. Both companies continued their efforts at developing hi reliability and hi frequency applications for their customers. Dow Key continued to be profitable on flat sales. Dow Key serves primarily the military, space and industrial markets, which have not been as volatile as the telecom industry. MARKING AND CODING Imaje, the French based industrial marking and coding Company, reported full year sales of $287.9 million, an increase of 24%, and earnings of almost $60 million, an increase of 21%. Imaje had historically relied on its continuous ink jet small character printer and related ink as its primary products. During 2003 and 2002, Imaje, through acquisitions, acquired "drop on demand" large character printer and thermal printer technologies. During 2003, products related to these new capabilities grew to 21% of equipment sales, from 17% in 2002, while at the same time, ink jet unit sales grew 17% year over year. Imaje has a strong global presence. Sales for 2003, as compared to 2002, were enhanced by a 20% strengthening of the Euro against the dollar. However, margins continued to be pressured as the majority of Imajes product costs were incurred in Euros while significant amounts of revenues were denominated in U.S. dollars. Consequently, Imaje was in the process of expanding its production and delivery platform in both China and North America. These efforts were expected to be accomplished by mid 2004. RESTRUCTURING AND INVENTORY CHARGES During 2002, the Companys segments and operating companies initiated a variety of restructuring programs. These restructuring programs focused on reducing the overall cost structure primarily through reductions in headcount and through the disposition or closure of certain non strategic or redundant product lines and manufacturing facilities. Restructuring charges consist of employee separation and facility exit costs. Restructuring charges for continuing operations were recorded as selling and administrative expenses. The employee separation programs for continuing operations involved approximately 3,700 employees, all of whom had been terminated as of December 31, 2003. The Company had completed the vast majority of restructuring programs undertaken in 2002 by the end of 2003. The remaining exit reserves relate to future lease payments for facilities that were closed. These costs will be paid over the remaining term of each lease. In 2002, the Company initiated restructuring programs at selected operating companies with ongoing efforts to reduce costs in the continually challenging business environments in which the Company operates. The total restructuring charges related to these programs in 2002 were $28.7 million. The restructuring charges included both employee separation costs of $11.9 million and costs associated with exit activities of $16.8 million. The restructuring in Technologies took place in the CBAT and SEC groups, in response to the significant declines in the end markets served by these operations. CBAT recorded $6.6 million for employee separation and $11.2 million for exit activities. The majority of the severance and exit costs were incurred at Universal, Everett Charles and DEK. The facility exit costs consist of lease terminations and idle equipment impairments. SEC recorded $2.5 million for employee separation and $3.6 million for facility exit activities. A majority of these costs were incurred at Quadrant and Novacap. Industries recorded restructuring charges of $3.7 million, of which $2.1 million was incurred to exit an under performing product line at Tipper Tie. The remaining $1.6 million was for employee separation and other exit costs. Diversified recorded $1.1 million of restructuring charges to rationalize its SWF business, of which $0.8 million was for severance. Due to significant declines in the demand for certain products, special inventory reserves of $12.0 million were established in 2002, primarily in the Technologies segment and, to a lesser degree, in the Diversified segment. NON GAAP DISCLOSURES In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Companys results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company also discloses non GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, net debt, total capitalization, operational working capital, revenues excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency 43 exchange rates and organic sales growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, sales and working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes the (1) net debt to total capitalization ratio and (2) free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity. Net debt to total capitalization is helpful in evaluating the Companys capital structure and the amount of leverage it employs. Free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions and repay debt. Reconciliations of free cash flow, total debt and net debt can be found in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis. Management believes that reporting operational working capital (also sometimes called "adjusted working capital"), which is calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable, provides a meaningful measure of the Companys operational results by showing the changes caused solely by sales. In addition, management believes that reporting operational working capital and revenues at constant currency, which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, provides a meaningful measure of the Companys operational changes, given the global nature of Dovers businesses. Management also believes that reporting organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions, provides a useful comparison of the Companys revenue performance and trends between periods. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK INTEREST RATES The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of long term fixed interest rate debt, interest rate swaps attached thereto, commercial paper borrowings and investments in cash equivalents. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. A 60 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates (10% of the Companys weighted average long term debt interest rate) would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of the Companys long term debt. Commercial paper borrowings are at variable interest rates, and have maturities of three months or less. A 14 basis point increase or decrease in the interest rates (10% of the Companys weighted average commercial paper interest rate) on commercial paper borrowings would have an immaterial impact on the Companys pre tax earnings. All highly liquid investments, including highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less, are considered cash equivalents. The Company places its investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer. A 21 basis point decrease or increase in interest rates (10% of the Companys weighted average interest rate) would have an immaterial impact on the Companys pre tax earnings. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had three interest rate swaps outstanding, as discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Company does not enter into derivative financial or derivative commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes. FOREIGN EXCHANGE The Company conducts business in various foreign currencies, primarily in Canada, Europe, Brazil, China and other Asian countries. Therefore, changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect the Companys financial position and cash flows when translated into U.S. Dollars. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2004 the Company had not established a formal company wide foreign currency hedging program but may, from time to time, for a specific exposure, enter into fair value hedges. The Company has mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which the majority of all costs are local currency based. A change of 10% or less in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the Companys financial position and cash flows. 44
