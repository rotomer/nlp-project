Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis below for the Company should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes found elsewhere in this report. All applicable disclosures in the following discussion have been modified to reflect the Restatement, as described below. For financial reporting, we operate on a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in May. Our 2004 fiscal year, which ended on May 30, 2004, had 53 weeks. Our 2003 fiscal year, which ended on May 25, 2003, and our 2002 fiscal year, which ended on May 26, 2002, each had 52 weeks. We have included in this discussion certain financial information for fiscal 2004 on a 52 week basis in order to assist investors in making comparisons to our prior fiscal years. RESTATEMENT Following a December 2004 review of the accounting adjustments cited in several recent Form 8 K filings by other restaurant companies, and in consultation with our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, we determined that one of the adjustments in those filings relating to the treatment of lease accounting and leasehold depreciation applied to us, and that it was appropriate to adjust certain of our prior financial statements. As a result, we have restated our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years 1996 through 2004 and for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Historically, when accounting for leases with renewal options, we recorded rent expense on a straight line basis over the initial non cancelable lease term, with the term commencing when actual rent payments began. We depreciate our buildings, leasehold improvements and other long lived assets on those properties over a period that includes both the initial non cancelable lease term and all option periods provided for in the lease (or the useful life of the assets, if shorter). We previously believed that these longstanding accounting treatments were appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles. We now have restated our financial statements to recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term, including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. The lease term commences on the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments. These adjustments were not attributable to any material non compliance by us, as a result of any misconduct, with any financial reporting requirements under the securities laws. The Restatement is further discussed in the "Explanatory Note" in the forepart of this Form 10 K/A and in Note 2, "Restatement of Financial Statements" under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10 K/A. The cumulative effect of the Restatement through fiscal 2004 is an increase in deferred rent liability of $114 million and a decrease in deferred income tax liability of $44 million. As a result, retained earnings at the end of fiscal 2004 decreased by $70 million. Rent expense for fiscal years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002 increased by $7 million, $10 million, and $8 million, respectively. The Restatement decreased reported diluted net earnings per share by $0.02, $0.04 and $0.03 for the fiscal years ended 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The Restatement did not have any impact on our previously reported cash flows, sales or same restaurant sales or on our compliance with any covenant under our credit facility or other debt instruments. The impact of these adjustments on the consolidated statements of earnings for each of the three fiscal years from 2002 through 2004 is shown in the table below. Further information on the nature and impact of these adjustments is provided in Note 2, "Restatement of Financial Statements" under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10 K/A. 19 Net Earnings Adjustments Related to the Restatement (in thousands, except per share data) As Previously Fiscal Year 2004 Reported Adjustments As Restated Restaurant expenses $ 767,584 $ 7,222 $ 774,806 Total cost of sales 3,895,717 7,222 3,902,939 Total costs and expenses 4,663,357 7,222 4,670,579 Earnings before income taxes 339,998 (7,222) 332,776 Income taxes 108,536 (2,933) 105,603 Net earnings 231,462 (4,289) 227,173 Basic net earnings per share 1.42 (0.03) 1.39 Diluted net earnings per share $ 1.36 $ (0.02) $ 1.34 As Previously Fiscal Year 2003 Reported Adjustments As Restated Restaurant expenses $ 703,554 $ 10,145 $ 713,699 Total cost of sales 3,637,762 10,145 3,647,907 Total costs and expenses 4,307,223 10,145 4,317,368 Earnings before income taxes 347,748 (10,145) 337,603 Income taxes 115,488 (3,864) 111,624 Net earnings 232,260 (6,281) 225,979 Basic net earnings per share 1.36 (0.03) 1.33 Diluted net earnings per share $ 1.31 $ (0.04) $ 1.27 As Previously Fiscal Year 2002 Reported Adjustments As Restated Restaurant expenses $ 628,701 $ 7,874 $ 636,575 Total cost of sales 3,386,598 7,874 3,394,472 Total costs and expenses 4,003,602 7,874 4,011,476 Earnings before income taxes 363,309 (7,874) 355,435 Income taxes 125,521 (2,857) 122,664 Net earnings 237,788 (5,017) 232,771 Basic net earnings per share 1.36 (0.03) 1.33 Diluted net earnings per share $ 1.30 $ (0.03) $ 1.27 OVERVIEW OF OPERATIONS Our business operates in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry, primarily in the United States. At May 30, 2004, we operated 1,325 Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze, Smokey Bones Barbeque & Grill, and Seasons 52 restaurants in the United States and Canada and licensed 38 Red Lobster restaurants in Japan. We own and operate all of our restaurants in the United States and Canada, with no franchising. Our sales were $5.00 billion in fiscal 2004 and $4.65 billion in fiscal 2003, a 7.5 percent increase. On a 52 week basis, after adjusting for the $90 million of sales contributed by the additional 53rd operating week in fiscal 2004, total sales would have been $4.91 billion for fiscal 2004, a 5.5 percent increase from fiscal 2003. Net earnings for fiscal 2004 were $227 million ($1.34 per diluted share) compared with net earnings for fiscal 2003 of $226 million ($1.27 per diluted share). Net earnings for fiscal 2004 increased 0.5 percent and diluted net earnings per share increased 5.5 percent compared to fiscal 2003. Although Red Lobsters string of 23 consecutive quarters of U.S. same restaurant sales gains ended during fiscal 2004, Red Lobster has made progress in some important areas. Red Lobster improved its operating efficiency during fiscal 2004 through improvements in labor management and other cost controls, as well as implementing a less disruptive promotional strategy in the second half of fiscal 2004, which resulted in higher operating profit than in fiscal 2003. Results from guest satisfaction surveys also improved as the fiscal year progressed. Red Lobster retained a new advertising agency in fiscal 2004 and is in the process of developing a marketing plan designed to achieve more sustainable benefits than have been obtained in prior years. Red Lobster also is developing new entree offerings in the $10 $15 price range to strengthen the value offered to its guests. Olive Gardens sales gains in fiscal 2004, combined with lower food and beverage costs, restaurant 20 expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of sales, more than offset increased restaurant labor expenses as a percent of sales. This resulted in a double digit increase in operating profit for Olive Garden during fiscal 2004 along with record annual operating profit and return on sales. In fiscal 2005, we expect to increase our number of restaurants by approximately 50 to 60 restaurants. We expect combined same restaurant sales growth in fiscal 2005 of between one percent and three percent for Red Lobster and Olive Garden. We believe we can achieve diluted net earnings per share growth in the range of 8 percent to 12 percent for fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2005, we also expect Bahama Breeze to be accretive to earnings, and Smokey Bones to remain dilutive to earnings. However, we expect Smokey Bones to be accretive to earnings in the second half of fiscal 2005. As with same restaurant sales growth, there can always be some quarter to quarter variability in operating results, where specific factors put us above or below the expected range of diluted net earnings per share growth. We believe our strong balance sheet and cash flows will be important factors in helping us reach our goals. Our mission is to be the best in casual dining, now and for generations. To achieve this goal, we focus on four strategic imperatives: leadership excellence, brand management excellence, service and hospitality excellence, and culinary and beverage excellence. From a financial perspective, we seek to increase sales and profits. To evaluate our operations and assess our financial performance, we use the following two key factors: o Same restaurant sales a year over year comparison of each periods sales volumes for restaurants that are open more than 16 months; and o Operating margins restaurant sales less restaurant level cost of sales (food and beverage costs, restaurant labor, and other restaurant expenses). Increasing same restaurant sales can increase operating margins, since these incremental sales provide better leverage of our fixed costs. Same restaurant sales increases can be generated by increases in guest traffic, increases in the average guest check, or a combination of the two. The average guest check can be impacted by menu price changes and by the mix of menu items sold. For each concept, we gather sales data daily and regularly analyze the guest traffic counts and the mix of menu items sold to assist in developing menu pricing, product offerings, and promotional strategies. We view guest traffic counts as an indication of the long term health of a concept, while increases in average check and menu mix may contribute more significantly to near term profitability. We continually focus on balancing our pricing and product offerings with other initiatives to generate sustainable growth in same restaurant sales. Incremental same restaurant sales increases make a significant contribution to our profitability. Many restaurant level expenses are relatively fixed in nature and do not vary with sales volumes. Therefore, same restaurant sales increases can improve our profitability. We define same restaurants as restaurants that have been open at least 16 months. New restaurants experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize, and sales at newly opened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation. Our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants, and the closing, relocation, and remodeling of existing restaurants. Pre opening expenses each period reflect the costs associated with opening new restaurants in current and future periods. There are significant risks and challenges that could impact our operations and ability to increase sales and earnings. The casual dining restaurant industry is highly competitive and sensitive to economic turns, trends in lifestyles and fluctuating costs. Operating margins for our concepts are susceptible to changes in the price of commodities, including seafood, beef, pork, chicken, cheese, produce, natural gas, and other energy supplies. Other risks and uncertainties include the price and availability of labor, insurance and media; possible unfavorable publicity relating to food safety or other concerns; government regulation and litigation; and factors that could impact our growth plans, including the availability of suitable restaurant locations, construction cost increases, construction delays, and other factors. 21 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2004, 2003 and 2002 The following table sets forth selected operating data as a percentage of sales for the 53 week period ended May 30, 2004 and the 52 week periods ended May 25, 2003 and May 26, 2002. All information is derived from the consolidated statements of earnings for the periods indicated.

The 7.5% increase in company wide sales for fiscal 2004 was primarily due to a net increase of 54 company owned restaurants since fiscal 2003, same restaurant sales increases at Olive Garden, and the additional operating week in fiscal 2004. These sales increases were partially offset by decreased same restaurant sales at Red Lobster. After adjusting for $90 million of sales contributed by the additional operating week, total sales would have been $4.91 billion for fiscal 2004 on a 52 week basis, a 5.5 percent increase from fiscal 2003. Red Lobster sales of $2.44 billion were 0.1 percent above last year. U.S. same restaurant sales for Red Lobster decreased 3.5 percent due to a 6.5 percent decrease in same restaurant guest counts, offset partially by a 3.0 percent increase in average check. Average annual sales per restaurant for Red Lobster were $3.6 million in fiscal 2004 (on a 52 week basis). Olive Garden sales of $2.21 billion were 11.1 percent above last year. U.S. same restaurant sales for Olive Garden increased 4.6 percent due to a 3.0 percent increase in average check and a 1.6 percent increase in same restaurant guest counts. Average annual sales per restaurant for Olive Garden were $4.1 million in fiscal 2004 (on a 52 week basis). Olive Garden has enjoyed 39 consecutive quarters of U.S. same restaurant sales increases. Bahama Breeze sales of $176 million were 28 percent above last year. Bahama Breeze opened four new restaurants during fiscal 2004, including its new prototype restaurant in Pittsburgh, PA. Bahama Breeze also closed six restaurants during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 as a result of a comprehensive analysis performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 that examined restaurants not meeting our minimum return on investment thresholds and certain other operating performance criteria. Average annual sales per restaurant (excluding the six closed restaurants) were $5.2 million (on a 52 week basis). Smokey Bones sales of $174 million were 87 percent above last year. Average annual sales per restaurant were $3.2 million (on a 52 week basis). Smokey Bones opened 30 new restaurants during fiscal 2004. 22 The 6.6 percent increase in company wide sales for fiscal 2003 versus fiscal 2002 was primarily due to same restaurant sales increases in the U.S. and a net increase of 60 company owned restaurants since fiscal 2002. Red Lobster sales of $2.43 billion were 4.1 percent above fiscal 2002. U.S. same restaurant sales for Red Lobster increased 2.7 percent due to a 3.1 percent increase in average check, partially offset by a 0.4 percent decrease in same restaurant guest counts. Average annual sales per restaurant for Red Lobster were $3.7 million in fiscal 2003. Olive Garden sales of $1.99 billion were 6.8 percent above fiscal 2002. U.S. same restaurant sales for Olive Garden increased 2.2 percent due to a 3.7 percent increase in average check and a 1.5 percent decrease in same restaurant guest counts. Average annual sales per restaurant for Olive Garden were $3.9 million in fiscal 2003. Bahama Breeze opened five new restaurants during fiscal 2003 and generated sales that exceeded $137 million. Smokey Bones opened 20 new restaurants during fiscal 2003 and generated sales of $93 million. COSTS AND EXPENSES Total costs and expenses were $4.67 billion in fiscal 2004, $4.32 billion in fiscal 2003, and $4.01 billion in fiscal 2002. Total costs and expenses in fiscal 2004 were 93.4 percent of sales, an increase from 92.7 percent of sales in fiscal 2003. The following analysis of the components of total costs and expenses is presented as a percent of sales. Food and beverage costs increased $78 million, or 5.4 percent, from $1.45 billion to $1.53 billion in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. Food and beverage costs increased $65 million, or 4.7 percent, from $1.38 billion to $1.45 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. As a percent of sales, food and beverage costs decreased from the prior year in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of pricing changes, and favorable changes in promotional and menu mix of sales, which was partially offset by higher seafood costs and by crab usage and additional plate accompaniments at Red Lobster during its crab promotion in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Other commodity costs, such as chicken and shrimp, decreased modestly. Restaurant labor increased $116 million, or 7.8 percent, from $1.49 billion to $1.60 billion in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. Restaurant labor increased $112 million, or 8.1 percent, from $1.37 billion to $1.49 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. As a percent of sales, restaurant labor increased in fiscal 2004 primarily as a result of a modest increase in wage rates at Red Lobster and Olive Garden, and higher manager bonuses at Olive Garden as a result of their increased operating performance in fiscal 2004. These factors were only partially offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and lower health insurance costs as a result of fewer claims. As a percent of sales, restaurant labor increased in fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of a modest increase in wage rates, higher promotional staffing levels, and increased sales volatility, which made it more difficult to predict staffing needs. These factors were only partially offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volumes. Restaurant expenses (which include lease, property tax, credit card, utility, workers compensation, insurance, new restaurant pre opening, and other restaurant level operating expenses) increased $61 million, or 8.6 percent, from $714 million to $775 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. Restaurant expenses increased $77 million, or 12.1 percent, from $637 million to $714 million in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. As a percent of sales, restaurant expenses increased in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 primarily due to increased utility, workers compensation, insurance and new restaurant pre opening costs. These cost increases were only partially offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volumes. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $40 million, or 9.4 percent, from $432 million to $472 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $15 million, or 3.5 percent, from $417 million to $432 million in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. As a percent of sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2004 primarily due to increased employee benefit costs, an increase in the amount contributed to the Darden Restaurants, Inc. Foundation, and an increase in litigation related costs, which were only partially offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volumes. As a percent of sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal 2003 were less than fiscal 2002 primarily as a result of decreased bonus costs and the favorable impact of higher sales volumes, which were partially offset by increased marketing expense incurred in response to the challenging economic and competitive environment. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $19 million, or 9.8 percent, from $191 million to $210 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $25 million, or 15.3 percent, from $166 million to $191 million in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. As a percent of sales, depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2004 and 2003 primarily as a result of new restaurant and remodel activities, which were only partially offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volumes. 23 Net interest expense increased $1 million, or 2.5 percent, from $43 million to $44 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. Net interest expense increased $6 million, or 16.4 percent, from $37 million to $43 million in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. As a percent of sales, net interest expense in fiscal 2004 was comparable to fiscal 2003, reflecting lower interest income in fiscal 2004, offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volumes. As a percent of sales, net interest expense in fiscal 2003 was comparable to fiscal 2002 primarily because increased interest expense associated with higher average debt levels in fiscal 2003 was offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volumes. After a comprehensive analysis performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 that examined restaurants not meeting our minimum return on investment thresholds and other operating performance criteria, we recorded a $36.5 million pre tax ($22.4 million after tax) charge for long lived asset impairments associated with the closing of six Bahama Breeze restaurants and the write down of the carrying value of four other Bahama Breeze restaurants, one Olive Garden restaurant, and one Red Lobster restaurant, which continued to operate. We also recorded a $1.1 million pre tax ($0.7 million after tax) restructuring charge primarily related to severance payments made to certain restaurant employees and exit costs associated with the closing of the six Bahama Breeze restaurants. During fiscal 2004, certain changes were made at Bahama Breeze to improve its sales, financial performance, and overall long term potential, including the addition of lunch at most restaurants and introduction of a new dinner menu. The decision to close certain Bahama Breeze restaurants and write down the carrying value of others was based on our on going review of each individual restaurants performance against our expectations and their ability to successfully implement these changes. Based on our review of the other 28 Bahama Breeze restaurants, we believe their locations and ability to execute these and future initiatives will minimize the likelihood that additional impairment charges will be required. The write down of the carrying value of one Olive Garden restaurant and one Red Lobster restaurant was a result of less than optimal locations. We will continue to evaluate all of our locations to minimize the risk of future asset impairment charges. In addition to the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter action, we recognized asset impairment charges in the amount of $5.7 million and $4.9 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to the relocation and rebuilding of certain restaurants. Asset impairment credits related to the sale of assets that were previously impaired amounted to $1.4 million and $0.6 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Pre tax restructuring credits of $0.4 million and $2.6 million were recorded in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. The credits resulted from lower than projected costs of lease terminations in connection with our fiscal 1997 restructuring. All fiscal 1997 restructuring actions were completed as of May 25, 2003. INCOME TAXES The effective income tax rates for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002 were 31.7 percent, 33.1 percent, and 34.5 percent, respectively. The rate decrease in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 was primarily a result of favorable resolutions of prior year tax matters and an increase in FICA tax credits for employee reported tips. NET EARNINGS AND NET EARNINGS PER SHARE Net earnings for fiscal 2004 were $227 million ($1.34 per diluted share) compared with net earnings for fiscal 2003 of $226 million ($1.27 per diluted share) and net earnings for fiscal 2002 of $233 million ($1.27 per diluted share). Net earnings for fiscal 2004 increased 0.5 percent and diluted net earnings per share increased 5.5 percent compared to fiscal 2003. The increase in net earnings was primarily due to decreases in food and beverage costs as a percent of sales, which were only partially offset by increases in restaurant labor, restaurant expenses, selling, general, and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of sales. Net earnings were also impacted by the $38 million pre tax ($23 million after tax) asset impairment and restructuring charges recognized during fiscal 2004 related to the closing of six Bahama Breeze restaurants and write down of another four Bahama Breeze restaurants, one Olive Garden restaurant and one Red Lobster restaurant. The increase in diluted net earnings per share is primarily due to a reduction in the average diluted shares outstanding from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 because of our continuing repurchase of our common stock. Net earnings for fiscal 2003 decreased 2.9 percent and diluted net earnings per share was comparable to fiscal 2002. The decrease in net earnings was primarily due to increases in restaurant labor, restaurant expenses, and depreciation and amortization expenses as a percent of sales, which were only partially offset by decreases in food and beverage costs and selling, general, and administrative costs as a percent of sales. Diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2003 was comparable to fiscal 2002 due to a reduction in the average diluted shares outstanding from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 because of our continuing repurchase of our common stock, which was offset by the decrease in net earnings in fiscal 2003. 24 SEASONALITY Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally. During fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, our sales were highest in the spring, lowest in the fall, and comparable during winter and summer. Holidays, severe weather, and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. IMPACT OF INFLATION We do not believe inflation had a significant overall effect on our operations during fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002. We believe we have historically been able to pass on increased operating costs through menu price increases and other strategies. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Land, Buildings, and Equipment Land, buildings, and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Building components are depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from seven to 40 years using the straight line method. Leasehold improvements, which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of buildings, are amortized over the lesser of the expected lease term, including cancelable option periods, or the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight line method. Equipment is depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from two to 10 years, also using the straight line method. Accelerated depreciation methods are generally used for income tax purposes. Our accounting policies regarding land, buildings, and equipment, including leasehold improvements, include our judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of these assets, the residual values to which the assets are depreciated or amortized, and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of existing assets. These judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of reported depreciation and amortization expense if different assumptions were used. As discussed further below, these judgments may also impact our need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Land, buildings, and equipment and certain other assets, including capitalized software costs and liquor licenses, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. Identifiable cash flows are measured at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities, generally at the restaurant level. If these assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Fair value is generally determined based on appraisals or sales prices of comparable assets. Restaurant sites 25 and certain other assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Restaurant sites and certain other assets to be disposed of are included in assets held for disposal when certain criteria are met. These criteria include the requirement that the likelihood of disposing of these assets within one year is probable. Those assets whose disposal is not probable within one year remain in land, buildings, and equipment until their disposal is probable within one year. The judgments we make related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of these assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in usage or operating performance. As we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long lived assets, significant adverse changes in these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge. In fiscal 2004, we recognized asset impairment charges of $37 million ($22 million after tax) for the closing of six Bahama Breeze restaurants and the write down of four other Bahama Breeze restaurants, one Olive Garden restaurant, and one Red Lobster restaurant based on an evaluation of expected cash flows. Self Insurance Accruals We self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation, employee medical, and general liability programs. Accrued liabilities have been recorded based on our estimates of the ultimate costs to settle incurred claims, both reported and not yet reported. Our accounting policies regarding self insurance programs include our judgments and independent actuarial assumptions regarding economic conditions, the frequency or severity of claims and claim development patterns, and claim reserve, management, and settlement practices. Unanticipated changes in these factors may produce materially different amounts of reported expense under these programs. Income Taxes We estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes. These estimates include, among other items, depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes, allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported employee tip income, effective rates for state and local income taxes, and the tax deductibility of certain other items. Our estimates are based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the provision. We generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end. Income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state, and local governments, generally years after the returns are filed. These returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash flows generated from operating activities provide us with a significant source of liquidity. Since substantially all our sales are for cash and cash equivalents, and accounts payable are generally due in five to 30 days, we are able to carry current liabilities in excess of current assets. In addition to cash flows from operations, we use a combination of long term and short term borrowings to fund our capital needs. We manage our business and our financial ratios to maintain an investment grade bond rating, which allows flexible access to financing at reasonable costs. Currently, our publicly issued long term debt carries "Baa1" (Moodys Investors Service), "BBB+" (Standard & Poors) and "BBB+" (Fitch) ratings. Our commercial paper has ratings of "P 2" (Moodys Investors Service), "A 2" (Standard & Poors) and "F 2" (Fitch). These ratings are as of the date of this annual report and have been obtained with the understanding that Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors, and Fitch will continue to monitor our credit and make future adjustments to these ratings to the extent warranted. The ratings may be changed, superseded, or withdrawn at any time. Our commercial paper program serves as our primary source of short term financing. At May 30, 2004, $15 million was outstanding under the program. To support our commercial paper program, we have a credit facility under a Credit Agreement dated October 17, 2003, as amended, with a consortium of banks, including Wachovia Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, under which we can borrow up to $400 million. The credit facility allows us to borrow at interest rates based on a spread over (i) LIBOR or (ii) a base rate that is the higher of the prime rate, or one half of one percent above the federal funds rate, at our option. The interest rate spread over LIBOR is determined by our debt rating. The credit facility expires on October 17, 2008, and contains various restrictive 26 covenants, including a leverage test that requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization of less than 0.55 to 1.00 and a limitation of $25 million on priority debt, subject to certain exceptions. The credit facility does not, however, contain a prohibition on borrowing in the event of a ratings downgrade or a material adverse change in and of itself. None of these covenants are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. At May 30, 2004, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. At May 30, 2004, our long term debt consisted principally of: (1) $150 million of unsecured 8.375 percent senior notes due in September 2005, (2) $150 million of unsecured 6.375 percent notes due in February 2006, (3) $150 million of unsecured 5.75 percent medium term notes due in March 2007, (4) $75 million of unsecured 7.45 percent medium term notes due in April 2011, (5) $100 million of unsecured 7.125 percent debentures due in February 2016, and (6) an unsecured, variable rate, $29 million commercial bank loan due in December 2018 that supports two loans from us to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan portion of the Darden Savings Plan. Through a shelf registration on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we may issue up to an additional $125 million of unsecured debt securities from time to time. The debt securities may bear interest at either fixed or floating rates, and may have maturity dates of nine months or more after issuance. A summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at May 30, 2004, is as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Less than 1 3 3 5 After 5 Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years Years Short term debt $ 14,500 $ 14,500 $ $ $ Long term debt (1) 654,403 450,000 204,403 Operating leases 373,699 62,070 108,218 80,009 123,402 Purchase obligations(2) 670,019 575,836 94,183 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,712,621 $ 652,406 $ 652,401 $80,009 $ 327,805 Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period Total Other Commercial Amounts Less than 1 3 3 5 After 5 Commitments Committed 1 Year Years Years Years Trade letters of credit $ 242 $ 242 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit (3) 88,376 88,376 Guarantees (4) 4,346 796 1,488 1,147 915 Other 2,125 750 1,375 Total commercial commitments $ 95,089 $ 90,164 $ 2,863 $ 1,147 $ 915 1) Excludes issuance discount of $1,054. 2) Includes commitments for food and beverage items and supplies, capital projects, and other miscellaneous commitments. 3) Includes letters of credit for $72,480 of workers compensation and general liabilities accrued in our consolidated financial statements; also includes letters of credit for $7,635 of lease payments included in contractual operating lease obligation payments noted above. 4) Consists solely of guarantees associated with sub leased properties. We are not aware of any non performance under these sub lease arrangements that would result in us having to perform in accordance with the terms of the guarantees. As disclosed in Exhibit 12 to this Form 10 K/A, our fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures the number of times each year that we earn enough to cover our fixed charges, amounted to 5.7 times and 5.8 times for the fiscal years ended May 30, 2004 and May 25, 2003, respectively. Our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio (which 27 includes 6.25 times the total annual restaurant minimum rent ($56.5 million and $48.1 million for the fiscal years ended May 30, 2004 and May 25, 2003, respectively) and 3.00 times the total annual restaurant equipment minimum rent ($.1 million and $5.7 million for the fiscal years ended May 30, 2004 and May 25, 2003, respectively) as components of adjusted debt and adjusted total capital) was 46 percent at May 30, 2004 and May 25, 2003. We use the lease debt equivalent in our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio as we believe its inclusion better represents the optimal capital structure that we target from period to period. Based on these ratios, we believe our financial condition is strong. The composition of our capital structure is shown in the following table. (In millions, except ratios) May 30, 2004 May 25, 2003 (as restated) (as restated) CAPITAL STRUCTURE Short term debt $ 15 $ Long term debt 653 658 Stockholders equity 1,175 1,130 Total capital $ 1,843 $ 1,788 ADJUSTMENTS TO CAPITAL Short term debt $ 15 $ Long term debt 653 658 Lease debt equivalent 353 318 Adjusted debt $1,021 $ 976 Stockholders equity 1,175 1,130 Adjusted total capital $2,196 $ 2,106 CAPITAL STRUCTURE RATIOS Debt to total capital ratio 36% 37% Adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio 46% 46% Net cash flows used in financing activities included our repurchase of 10.7 million shares of our common stock for $235 million in fiscal 2004, compared to 10.7 million shares for $213 million in fiscal 2003, and 9.0 million shares for $209 million in fiscal 2002. Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase up to 115.4 million shares of our common stock. At May 30, 2004, a total of 109.2 million shares have been repurchased under the authorization. The repurchased common stock is reflected as a reduction of stockholders equity. Net cash flows used in financing activities also included dividends paid to stockholders of $13 million, $14 million, and $9 million in fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Net cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures incurred principally for building new restaurants, replacing equipment, and remodeling existing restaurants. Capital expenditures were $354 million in fiscal 2004, compared to $423 million in fiscal 2003, and $318 million in fiscal 2002. The decreased expenditures in fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from decreased spending associated with building fewer new restaurants and fewer remodels. The increased expenditures in fiscal 2003 resulted primarily from increased spending associated with building more new restaurants and replacing equipment. We estimate that our fiscal 2005 capital expenditures will approximate $360 million. Net cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal 2003 included a $20 million contribution to our defined benefit pension plans, which enabled the plans to maintain a fully funded status as of the plans February 28, 2003 annual valuation date. Less than $0.1 million was required to fund our defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2002. Our defined benefit and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" and No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions". We use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of a discount rate, expected long term rate of return on plan assets, and expected health care cost trend rates. We set the discount rate assumption annually for each plan at its valuation date to reflect the yield of high quality fixed income debt instruments, with lives that approximate the maturity of the plan benefits. At May 30, 2004, our discount rate was 6.0 percent. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets 28 and health care cost trend rates are based upon several factors, including our historical assumptions compared with actual results, an analysis of current market conditions, asset allocations, and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. Based on our analysis during fiscal 2003, we lowered our defined benefit plans expected long term rate of return on plan assets for fiscal 2004 from 10.4 percent to 9.0 percent. The change in our defined benefit plans expected long term rate of return on plan assets decreased earnings before income taxes by approximately $2 million in fiscal 2004. At May 30, 2004, our expected health care cost trend rates ranged from 11.0 percent to 12.0 percent for fiscal 2005, depending on the medical service category. The rates gradually decrease to 5.0 percent through fiscal 2010 and remain at that level thereafter. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets component of our net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the market related value of plan assets. Our target asset allocation is 35 percent U.S. equities, 30 percent high quality, long duration fixed income securities, 15 percent international equities, 10 percent private equities, and 10 percent real assets. We monitor our actual asset allocation to ensure that it approximates our target allocation and believe that our long term asset allocation will continue to approximate our target allocation. Our historical ten year rate of return on plan assets, calculated using the geometric method average of returns, is approximately 10.5 percent as of May 30, 2004. We have an unrecognized net actuarial loss for the defined benefit plans and postretirement benefit plan as of May 30, 2004, of $62 million and $6 million, respectively. The unrecognized net actuarial loss represents changes in the amount of the projected benefit obligation and plan assets resulting from differences in the assumptions used and actual experience. The amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial loss component of our fiscal 2005 net periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit plans and postretirement benefit plan is expected to be approximately $5 million and $0.3 million, respectively. We believe our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the factors discussed above. However, other assumptions could also be reasonably applied that could differ from the assumptions used. A quarter percentage point change in the defined benefit plans discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes by $0.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively. A quarter percentage point change in our postretirement benefit plan discount rate would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes by $0.1 million. A one percentage point increase in the health care cost trend rates would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) by $4 million at May 30, 2004, and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $0.3 million for fiscal 2004. A one percentage point decrease in the health care cost trend rates would have decreased the APBO by $3 million at May 30, 2004, and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $0.3 million for fiscal 2004. These changes in assumptions would not significantly impact our funding requirements. We are not aware of any trends or events that would materially affect our capital requirements or liquidity. We believe that our internal cash generating capabilities, borrowings available under our shelf registration for unsecured debt securities, and short term commercial paper program should be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures, stock repurchase program, and other operating activities through fiscal 2005. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. FINANCIAL CONDITION Our current assets totaled $346 million at May 30, 2004, compared to $326 million at May 25, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from increases in inventories of $25 million that resulted from opportunistic product purchases made during fiscal 2004. Our current liabilities were $683 million at May 30, 2004, compared to $640 million at May 25, 2003. At May 30, 2004, $15 million of short term debt was outstanding under our commercial paper program, which was used to fund current operations and capital expenditures. Accrued payroll of $103 million at May 30, 2004, increased from $86 million at May 25, 2003, principally due to higher incentive compensation earned in fiscal 2004. Other current liabilities of $228 million at May 30, 2004, increased from $202 million at May 25, 2003, principally due to a $19 29 million increase in liabilities associated with our non qualified deferred compensation plan and a $7 million increase in sales tax payable as a result of higher fourth quarter sales in fiscal 2004. Accrued income taxes of $49 million at May 30, 2004, decreased from $68 million at May 25, 2003, principally due to timing of income tax payments made and changes in temporary differences included in the deferred tax balances associated with current income tax deductions for certain land, buildings, and equipment. The $19 million decrease in accrued income taxes is offset by the related increase in net non current deferred income tax liabilities at May 30, 2004. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. To manage this exposure, we periodically enter into interest rate, foreign currency exchange, and commodity instruments for other than trading purposes (see Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We use the variance/covariance method to measure value at risk, over time horizons ranging from one week to one year, at the 95 percent confidence level. At May 30, 2004, our potential losses in future net earnings resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rate instruments, commodity instruments, and floating rate debt interest rate exposures were approximately $2 million over a period of one year (including the impact of the interest rate swap agreements discussed in Note 8 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The value at risk from an increase in the fair value of all of our long term fixed rate debt, over a period of one year, was approximately $22 million. The fair value of our long term fixed rate debt during fiscal 2004 averaged $690 million, with a high of $714 million and a low of $669 million. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows by targeting an appropriate mix of variable and fixed rate debt.
