Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Merger Completed On May 31, 2001, DTE Energy Company (DTE Energy or the Company) completed the acquisition of MCN Energy Group Inc. (MCN Energy). As discussed further in Note 2, MCN Energy merged with DTE Enterprises Inc., (Enterprises), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with Enterprises being the surviving corporation. The operations of Enterprises are included in the Companys consolidated results from the date of acquisition. Enterprises, a Michigan corporation, is an exempt holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Enterprises is primarily involved in natural gas production, gathering, processing, transmission, storage, distribution and energy marketing. Enterprises largest subsidiary, Michigan Consolidated Gas Company (MichCon), is a natural gas utility serving 1.2 million customers in a 14,700 square mile area in Michigan. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DTE Energys earnings in 2001 were $332 million or $2.16 per diluted share, compared to earnings of $468 million, or $3.27 per diluted share in 2000. As subsequently discussed, the comparability of earnings was affected by merger and restructuring charges and goodwill amortization associated with the MCN Energy merger that reduced after tax earnings by $204 million, or $1.32 per diluted share in 2001. The Company also recorded merger related charges in 2000 that reduced earnings by $16 million, or $.12 per diluted share. See Note 3 Merger and Restructuring Charges included herein for additional information. Excluding the merger and restructuring charges and goodwill amortization, DTE Energy had 2001 earnings of $536 million, or $3.48 per diluted share, compared to 2000 earnings of $484 million, or $3.39 per diluted share. The significant improvement in earnings primarily reflects contributions from gas operations acquired in the MCN Energy merger and lower income taxes resulting from the generation of additional alternate fuels tax credits by non regulated businesses. Partially offsetting these improvements were increased interest on long term debt that was incurred to finance the merger and lower margins from regulated electricity operations. DTE Energys earnings in 2000, before merger related charges, were up $1 million or $.06 per share from 1999 earnings of $483 million, or $3.33 per share. The slight increase was due to additional tax credits partially offset by a 5% residential rate reduction provided for in the June 2000 Michigan electric industry restructuring legislation (Note 4). 19 Table of Contents 2001 2000 1999 (in Millions, except per share data) Net Income (Loss) Before Reconciling Items: Regulated Operations Electric Utility $ 369 $ 427 $ 434 Gas Utility 23 392 427 434 Non regulated Operations Wholesale Marketing Trading 44 10 8 Energy Services 124 109 84 Other (6 ) (35 ) (23 ) 162 84 69 Corporate Other (18 ) (27 ) (20 ) 536 484 483 Merger and Restructuring Charges (175 ) (16 ) MCN Energy Goodwill Amortization (29 ) $ 332 $ 468 $ 483 Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share Before Reconciling Items: Regulated Operations Electric Utility $ 2.40 $ 2.99 $ 2.99 Gas Utility .15 2.55 2.99 2.99 Non regulated Operations Wholesale Marketing Trading .29 .07 .06 Energy Services .80 .76 .58 Other (.04 ) (.24 ) (.16 ) 1.05 .59 .48 Corporate Other (.12 ) (.19 ) (.14 ) 3.48 3.39 3.33 Merger and Restructuring Charges (1.13 ) (.12 ) MCN Energy Goodwill Amortization (.19 ) $ 2.16 $ 3.27 $ 3.33 Strategic direction The Company remains committed to increasing its earnings growth rate from the current 6% annual level to 8% by 2005. The growth strategy continues to be focused on strengthening the Companys core electric and gas utilities, building its portfolio of non regulated businesses and leveraging investments in energy technology. There is no assurance that the level of earnings growth will be achieved for 2002 and later years as the growth projections assume, among other things, the realization of anticipated cost savings related to the MCN Energy acquisition, continued growth in non regulated earnings and a midyear 2002 economic recovery. The Company expects the acquisition to provide pretax cost savings of over $100 million annually, totaling more than $650 million in savings over the next five years, primarily in the electric and gas utilities. Non regulated growth is expected to shift over the next few years from DTE Energys current reliance on profits from coal based fuel businesses that generate alternate fuels tax credits to 20 Table of Contents growth from energy technologies, on site energy projects, merchant generation and energy trading. The Company currently operates its businesses through six segments: Electric Utility; Gas Utility; Wholesale Marketing Trading; Energy Services; Other Non regulated Operations; and Corporate Other. Electric Utility is comprised of the operations of Detroit Edison and the International Transmission Company. Detroit Edison generates and distributes electricity throughout Southeastern Michigan to 2.1 million residential, commercial and industrial customers. The International Transmission Company owns transmission assets that are operated by the Midwest Independent System Operator, a regional transmission operator. Prior to June 2001, Detroit Edison owned these transmission assets. Gas Utility represents the operations of MichCon, which purchases, stores and distributes natural gas throughout Michigan to 1.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers. Wholesale Marketing Trading consists primarily of the electric, gas and coal trading and marketing operations of DTE Energy Trading Company and the natural gas trading and marketing operations of Enterprises. Wholesale Marketing Trading enters into forwards, futures, swaps and option contracts as part of its trading strategy. Wholesale Marketing Trading also purchases and sells electricity and gas to marketers and brokerage companies. Energy Services is comprised of various businesses that develop and manage energy related assets and services. Such projects include coke production, synfuels production, independent power plants, on site powerhouses and cogeneration facilities, coal services and landfill gas recovery. The economic viability of synfuels projects is tied to their generation of alternate fuels tax credits. Other Non regulated Operations represents the operations of energy businesses primarily involved in emerging technologies, and various other energy operations acquired with the MCN Energy merger, including the exploration and production of gas, the gathering, processing and storing of gas, and the production of methanol. Certain pipeline and storage assets are used to support the Wholesale Marketing Trading segment. Corporate Other includes administrative and general expenses, and interest cost of DTE Energy corporate that have not been allocated to the regulated and non regulated businesses. 21 Table of Contents Electric Utility Electric Utility net income before merger and restructuring charges decreased $58 million in 2001 and decreased $7 million in 2000, compared to the prior year. As subsequently discussed, the decline in 2001 is primarily attributable to lower commercial and industrial sales reflecting the impact of the current economic recession and customers participating in the Electric Choice Program, as well as higher operation and maintenance costs and the impact of securitization (Note 4). 2001 2000 Electric Utility Increase (Decrease) in Income Compared to Prior Year (in Millions) Operating revenues Rate reduction $ (116 ) $ (43 ) PSCR rate change 82 System sales volume and mix (69 ) 24 Wholesale sales 66 Other net 41 19 (78 ) 82 Fuel and purchased power 30 (165 ) Operation and maintenance (96 ) 76 Depreciation and amortization 75 (16 ) Taxes, other than income 15 (14 ) Interest expense and other (24 ) Income taxes 23 30 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax (3 ) Total change before merger and restructuring charges $ (58 ) $ (7 ) Operating revenues decreased $78 million in 2001 due to a decline in sales rates and electric sales for commercial and industrial customers. Sales rates for commercial and industrial customers were lowered by a 5% legislatively mandated rate reduction that began in April 2001. Commercial sales decreased primarily due to increased participation of customers in the Electric Choice Program. Under this program, participating customers choose to purchase their electricity from suppliers other than Detroit Edison. However, the Electric Utility continues to provide transmission and distribution services for these customers retaining margins from such services. Industrial sales reflect reduced auto and steel production, the impact of Electric Choice participation and the end of a special energy sales agreement with a large steel manufacturer in March of 2001. Partially offsetting these declines were increased revenues from residential and wholesale customers as well as higher revenues from providing other energy related services. Residential customer revenues reflect higher demand resulting from weather, partially offset by the impact of a 5% rate reduction that began in June 2000. Revenues from wholesale customers increased due to gains from settling forward sales contracts. The sales contracts were entered into to effectively close forward purchase contracts that hedged Detroit Edisons power supply costs. Accordingly, the gains from forward sales contracts were substantially offset by losses from forward purchase contracts which are recorded as part of fuel and purchased power costs. Operating revenues in 2000 increased $82 million over 1999 due to higher sales to commercial and industrial customers, partially offset by lower residential customer sales. Additionally, under the 22 Table of Contents Power Supply Cost Recovery (PSCR) mechanism which was in effect through June 2000, Detroit Edison increased rates in January 2000 to recover higher power costs. The increased commercial and industrial sales reflected favorable economic conditions in Michigan. Industrial sales also increased due to the special sales agreement with a large steel manufacturer. The decline in residential revenues reflects reduced demand resulting from a cooler summer in 2000 and the impact of the 5% rate reduction. Wholesale sales decreased due to lower demand for energy and less availability of energy for sale. Also impacting revenues in 2000 were higher revenues from other energy related services. Revenue and sales data follow: 2001 2000 1999 (in Millions) Residential $ 1,298 $ 1,265 $ 1,300 Commercial 1,533 1,670 1,629 Industrial 773 848 809 Wholesale 196 130 130 Other 251 216 179 $ 4,051 $ 4,129 $ 4,047 (in Thousands of MWh) Residential 14,503 13,903 14,064 Commercial 18,777 19,762 19,546 Industrial 14,430 16,090 15,647 Wholesale 868 2,592 3,672 Other 2,538 2,653 2,595 51,116 55,000 55,524 Fuel and purchased power expense decreased $30 million in 2001 and increased $165 million in 2000. The decline in 2001 is due to lower system output resulting from reduced electric sales, as well as the result of using a more favorable power supply mix reflecting increased usage of lower cost power from the Companys generating plants and reduced usage of higher cost purchased power. Also favorably impacting the 2001 comparison was an adjustment of a reserve associated with a contract to purchase steam at above market prices (Note 14). Additionally, losses on the settlement of forward and option contracts to hedge purchase power prices increased purchased power expense in 2001. The 2000 fuel and purchased power expense increase resulted primarily from greater reliance on higher cost purchased power and higher purchase power prices. 23 Table of Contents System output and average fuel and purchased power costs for Detroit Edison were as follows: 2001 2000 1999 (in Thousands of MWh) Power generated and purchased Power plant generation Fossil 39,711 42,100 43,016 Nuclear 8,555 8,239 9,484 Purchased power 7,482 8,877 6,959 System output 55,748 59,216 59,459 Average unit cost ($/MWh) Generation (1) $ 12.31 $ 12.78 $ 12.51 Purchased power (2) $ 78.24 $ 62.57 $ 54.80 (1) Represents fuel costs associated with power plants. (2) The average purchased power amounts include gains and losses from hedging activities. Operating and maintenance expenses increased $96 million in 2001 and decreased $76 million in 2000. The increase in 2001 was primarily due to expenses related to maintenance and reliability work for power generation facilities, which reduces random outages at power plants and Detroit Edisons reliance on purchased power. Additionally, the higher 2001 expenses include the cost of funding the low income and energy efficiency fund required by Michigan legislation which is recovered in current sales rates and costs allocated from DTE Energy corporate for various corporate support services. The increase was partially offset by synergy cost savings related to the MCN Energy merger. The decrease in 2000 operation and maintenance expenses resulted primarily from lower costs associated with restoring power to customers who lost service during severe storms, as well as the elimination of computer system related costs associated with year 2000 (Y2K) initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $75 million in 2001 and increased $16 million in 2000. The 2001 decline reflects the extension of the amortization period from seven years to 15 years for certain regulatory assets that were securitized in March 2001 (Note 4), partially offset by depreciation on higher levels of plant in service. The increase in 2000 was due to increased levels of plant in service and the accelerated amortization of unamortized nuclear costs. Taxes other than income decreased $15 million in 2001 and increased $14 million in 2000. The improvement in 2001 is attributed to an adjustment in property tax expense reflecting a change in method of calculating the taxable value of personal property subject to taxation by local taxing jurisdictions. New valuation tables approved by the Michigan State Tax Commission more accurately recognize the impact of regulation on the value of a utilitys personal property based on the propertys age. Partially offsetting the 2001 decline and resulting in the 2000 increase were property taxes associated with higher property balances. Lower Michigan Single Business Taxes also affected both years. Interest expense and other increased $24 million in 2001 due primarily to debt issued for securitization, partially offset by redemptions of higher cost debt with the proceeds of the 24 Table of Contents securitization bonds (Note 10). Detroit Edison completed the redemption of debt with securitization proceeds in 2001. Outlook The Electric Utility segment expects electric system sales to remain relatively flat in 2002 due to the current economic recession and to grow modestly beginning in 2003. The state of Michigan continues its initiatives to restructure the electric industry by increasing competition among alternative suppliers of electric generation services. Effective January 1, 2002, the Electric Choice Program was expanded whereby all electric customers can choose to purchase their electricity from suppliers other than their local utility (Note 4). Prior to January 2002, electric restructuring legislation limited customer participation in the Electric Choice Program. Detroit Edison does not earn generation margins on electricity sales to customers who choose to participate in the Electric Choice Program. However, the Electric Utility segment will continue to earn margins from providing transmission and distribution delivery services to participating customers. Detroit Edison expects to lose 5% to 8% of its sales as a result of customers choosing to participate in Electric Choice during 2002. As subsequently discussed, Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) orders issued in December 2001 could result in higher numbers of retail customers being lost to Electric Choice. Detroit Edison expects to sell more electricity in the wholesale market as a result of the available capacity left by customers participating in Electric Choice. The additional wholesale revenues are expected to partially offset any decline in revenues from retail customers. The MPSC issued orders in December 2001 which are designed to increase customer participation in the Electric Choice Program and allow Detroit Edison to recover costs related to its generation operations that may not otherwise be recoverable (stranded costs) due to Electric Choice related lost sales and margins. The MPSC essentially determined that Electric Choice customers should not pay a securitization and tax surcharge that other customers are required to pay and will continue to be credited with an additional 5% rate reduction which is funded by savings from securitization. These provisions will likely result in Detroit Edisons power costs being higher than that of alternative suppliers, encouraging additional customer participation in the Electric Choice Program. As a result of the MPSC orders, Detroit Edison would recover the net stranded costs associated with its electric generation operations. Specifically there would be an annual filing with the MPSC comparing actual revenues from generation services to the revenue requirements, including an allowance for the cost of capital, to recover the costs of generation operations. The MPSC in its orders determined that Detroit Edison had no stranded costs using 2000 data, established a zero 2002 transition charge and deferred the issues of refining the net stranded costs methodology and the recalculating of net stranded costs to 2002. Detroit Edison has substantive issues with the MPSCs methodology of calculating stranded costs and has asked for rehearing, clarification and substantial changes on certain aspects of the order. For further information concerning the Electric Choice Program and industry restructuring, see Note 4 Regulatory Matters Electric Industry Restructuring Michigan Legislation. Electric Utility future operating results will also vary with a variety of other external factors such as weather, the cost of fuel and purchased power, and changes in economic conditions. The current 25 Table of Contents economic recession has lowered margins from commercial and industrial customers in the latter half of 2001 and is expected to unfavorably impact margins through the first half of 2002. Management expects to meet the challenges of the recession, Electric Choice and the imposed retail rate freezes by, among other actions, reducing costs at Detroit Edison as a result of the acquisition of MCN Energy and its wholly owned gas utility, MichCon. Approximately 35% of Detroit Edisons 2.1 million customers are also customers of MichCon. Detroit Edison and MichCon have begun and expect to continue realizing synergies from integrated common, duplicative functions. As a result of the continued restructuring of the electric industry, the Company is currently contemplating the sale of ITC. Any divestiture will be independently evaluated to maximize shareholder value. Gas Utility The Gas Utility, before merger and restructuring charges, had net income of $23 million for the seven months in 2001. As previously discussed, DTE Energy acquired MichCon on May 31, 2001, as part of the MCN Energy merger. Accordingly, the operating results of MichCon are included in the Companys consolidated results from the acquisition date. The pro forma impact of MCN Energy on the Company is included in Note 2 MCN Energy Acquisition. 2001 (Dollars in Millions) $ Bcf Gas Statistics Operating revenues Gas sales 491 95 End user transportation 50 81 Intermediate transportation 26 304 Other 36 603 480 Cost of Gas Sold 296 n/a Gross Margin Actual 307 n/a Impact of weather warmer than normal 20 14 Gross Margin Weather Normalized 327 494 Gas sales and end user transportation services generated 80% of total gross margins for the Gas Utility segment. Margins from providing gas sales and end user transportation services are seasonal and weather dependent with the majority of profits generated in the colder first and fourth quarters. Mild weather, which was 20% warmer than normal in the fourth quarter of 2001, reduced gross margins by $20 million ($13 million after taxes) and reduced gas sales by 14 billion cubic feet (Bcf). Gas sales represent the sale and delivery of natural gas primarily to residential and small volume commercial and industrial customers. Through December 2001, MichCon operated under a Gas Sales Program in which its sales rates included a gas commodity component that was fixed at $2.95 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). Under this program, MichCon had commodity price risk associated with its ability to secure gas supplies at prices less than $2.95 per Mcf. As discussed in the Outlook section that follows, MichCon returned to a Gas Cost Recovery (GCR) mechanism 26 Table of Contents in January 2002 and no longer has commodity price risk. End user transportation represents a gas delivery service for customers, including customer choice customers, who purchase natural gas directly from producers or brokerage companies and contract with MichCon to deliver that gas to their premises. Intermediate transportation services represents a gas delivery service for producers, brokers and other gas companies that own the natural gas but are not the ultimate consumers. Although intermediate transportation volumes are a significant part of total deliveries, profit margins on this service are considerably less than margins on gas sales and end user transportation services. Intermediate transportation deliveries include volumes associated with fixed fee customers. Transportation volumes for fixed fee customers may fluctuate, however revenues from such customers are not affected. Other operating revenues include late payment fees, appliance maintenance services and other gas related services. Cost of gas is affected by variations in gas sales volumes, cost of purchased gas and related transportation costs, and the effects of any permanent liquidation of inventory gas which is accounted for under the last in first out (LIFO) method. The 2001 results benefited from a 2.1 Bcf liquidation in inventory gas that was priced at $0.39 per Mcf. The Gas Utilitys 2001 average gas purchase rate was $2.83 per Mcf higher than the average LIFO liquidation rate. Outlook The Gas Utility segments objective is to expand its role as the preferred provider of natural gas and high value energy services within Michigan. Management expects to improve the Gas Utilitys cost competitiveness as a result of the merger. Approximately 60% of MichCons 1.2 million customers are also customers of Detroit Edison. Contributions from the Gas Utility segment are expected to increase significantly in 2002 when the financial results reflect a full 12 months of DTE Energy owning MichCon. The MPSC is continuing its initiatives designed to give all of Michigans natural gas customers added choices and the opportunity to benefit from lower gas costs resulting from competition. In December 2001, the MPSC issued an order that continues the Gas Choice Program on a permanent and expanding basis beginning with the conclusion of the three year temporary program on March 31, 2002. Under the expanded program, beginning April 1, 2002, up to approximately 40% of customers could elect to purchase gas from suppliers other than MichCon. Beginning in April 2003, up to approximately 60% of customers could participate and beginning April 2004, all 1.2 million of MichCons gas customers could choose to participate. MichCon will continue to transport and deliver the gas to the participating customers premises at prices that generate favorable margins. As of December 2001, approximately 30,000 customers were participating in the temporary Gas Choice Program. Under the MPSC order, MichCon returned to a GCR mechanism upon termination of its three year experimental Gas Sales Program in December 2001. MichCons gas sales rates will now include a gas commodity component designed to recover its actual gas costs. For further information concerning the Gas Choice and Gas Sales Programs, see Note 4 Regulatory Matters Gas Industry Restructuring. 27 Table of Contents Gas Utility future operating results will vary as a result of weather and changes in economic conditions. The current economic recession and the significantly warmer 2001 2002 winter lowered margins from residential, commercial and industrial customers in the latter half of 2001. Wholesale Marketing Trading Wholesale Marketing Tradings income totaled $44 million in 2001, an increase of $34 million from 2000. Income in 2000 increased a slight $2 million from 1999. The electric marketing and trading portion of the segment contributed $8 million in 2001, representing realized margins primarily associated with short term, back to back, physical power purchases and sales. The gas portion of the segment contributed the remaining $36 million, representing mark to market gains on long term gas sales contracts with several cogeneration facilities. Commodity price risk of the Wholesale Marketing Trading segment are managed by utilizing derivative financial contracts to offset the risk inherent in its portfolio of electric and gas supply and sales agreements. The segments objective is to enter into new transactions that are hedgeable and profitable from an economic standpoint. Wholesale Marketing Trading accounts for this risk minimization strategy by marking to market its commodity forwards, financial derivatives, and corresponding physical positions so there are substantial offsetting amounts. This fair value accounting better aligns financial reporting for the segment with the way management manages the business and measures its performance. In 2001, Wholesale Marketing Trading experienced earnings volatility as a result of its production related gas supply as well as from open positions related to its long term gas transportation and storage assets. The segment receives gas produced from DTE Energys exploration production (EP) operations which is used to meet its commitments under long term contracts with cogeneration customers. The EP gas does not qualify for mark to market accounting. Wholesale Marketing Trading recorded a gain in 2001 totaling approximately $50 million, net of taxes, primarily attributable to marking to market sales contracts with power generation customers without recording an offsetting loss from marking to market the production related gas supply. In December 2001, Wholesale Marketing Trading entered into hedge transactions that substantially mitigate the earnings volatility related to the gas contracts with power generation customers. Wholesale Marketing Trading operates a storage trading strategy primarily utilizing the facilities owned and operated by DTE Energy. Employing a combination of physical and financial contracts, in conjunction with the injection and withdrawal capabilities of the storage fields, the segment is able to capture seasonal price spreads. As forward prices change, the timing of the physical flow of gas is optimized to obtain the highest margin. Trades under this strategy are marked to market against the forward curve. Physical gas in storage, however, is marked to the current spot price under fair value accounting rules. This difference in accounting for forward trades and gas in storage occasionally results in earnings volatility when price changes in the spot month do not correspond with those in future delivery months. Gas in storage in December 2001 was priced at a spot market rate of $2.77 per Mcf, compared to a May 31, 2001, merger date rate of $5.28 per Mcf. Significantly smaller changes in forward prices 28 Table of Contents occurred during these same periods. As a result, the mark to market losses on gas inventory were only partially offset by mark to market gains on the storage related derivatives. Outlook Wholesale Marketing Trading will focus on expanding its coverage within existing markets in the northeast and midwest United States and eastern Canada. Gas storage and transportation capacity enhances its ability to provide reliable and custom tailored, bundled services to large volume end users and utilities. This capacity, coupled with the synergies from DTE Energys other businesses, positions the segment to capitalize on opportunities for expansion of its market base. Wholesale Marketing Trading manages commodity price risk by utilizing derivative financial contracts to more fully balance its portfolio of gas and electric supply and sales agreements. Wholesale Marketing Trading attempts to maintain a balanced or flat book from an economic standpoint. However, Wholesale Marketing Trading will experience earnings volatility as a result of open positions related to long term gas transportation contracts with third parties and due to fluctuations in inventory valuations. The Company is currently evaluating various hedge strategies related to these assets. Energy Services Net income increased $15 million in 2001 and $25 million in 2000. The improvement in both periods is attributed to an increased generation of alternate fuels tax credits which totaled $165 million in 2001, compared to $130 million in 2000 and $116 million in 1999. The higher tax credits reflect an increased level of operations, and the addition of three new synfuels projects in 2001. Additionally, results reflect increased contributions from the coal services business and the biomass landfill gas recovery operation. Gains on the sale of minority interests in two coke battery projects in 2001 were offset by reduced levels of income generated by the projects. The improved earnings were partially offset by increased new project development costs. Outlook The Energy Services segments objective is to continue developing and relocating synfuel projects and to focus on on site energy projects and independent power projects. Management expects three new synfuel sites, two electric generation projects and two industrial on site energy projects to become operational in 2002. Contributions from new synfuel projects will be partially offset by reduced earnings from coke battery projects due to the expiration of related alternate fuels tax credits at the end of 2002. Additionally, tax credits from synfuel projects will expire at the end of 2007 with the possibility of being extended. The focus of this business, which had primarily been to develop, construct, own and operate projects, will shift for the near term to acquiring operating assets or existing projects under construction. Other Non regulated Operations Net losses from Other Non regulated Operations declined $29 million in 2001 and increased $12 million in 2000. Results reflect losses in 2000 from an electric marketing company that was participating in a Pennsylvania customer choice program. The Company has discontinued the operations of the electric marketing company. 29 Table of Contents Outlook The Company will continue to invest in emerging technologies, and various other energy operations. Growth in future years is expected from the successful development and marketing of various distributed generation products, including standby generators, external combustion engines, mini turbines and fuel cells. Additionally, the Company will consider further developing its gas production properties in northern Michigan and its pipelines, processing and storage assets. Non strategic operations acquired with the MCN Energy merger will be sold to partially fund non regulated growth. Corporate Other Results from Corporate Other improved by $9 million in 2001 and declined by $7 million in 2000. The improvement in 2001 reflects the allocation of corporate support expenses to regulated and non regulated operations as well as reduced interest expense resulting from the repayment of debt with proceeds received from Detroit Edison. Upon issuing $1.75 billion of securitization bonds, Detroit Edison distributed approximately 50% of such proceeds to DTE Energy corporate. DTE Energy used such proceeds to retire debt and repurchase common shares. The Corporate Other decrease in 2000 reflects higher interest expense and corporate support expenses. 30 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 2001 2000 1999 Cash and Cash Equivalents (in Millions) Cash Flow From (Used For) Operating activities $ 811 $ 1,015 $ 1,084 Investing activities (2,286 ) (674 ) (712 ) Financing activities 1,679 (310 ) (469 ) Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 204 $ 31 $ (97 ) Operating Activities DTE Energys consolidated net cash from operating activities decreased $204 million in 2001 and $69 million in 2000. The decline in 2001 resulted primarily from higher working capital requirements partially offset by higher net income, after adjusting for noncash items (depreciation, amortization, deferred taxes and certain restructuring charges). The higher working capital primarily reflects the seasonal requirements in the second half of 2001 of the gas business where cash is used to finance increases in gas inventories and customer accounts receivable. The Company uses its cash derived from operating activities primarily to maintain and expand its core electric and gas utility businesses and to build non regulated businesses. In addition, the Company uses cash from operations to retire long term debt and to pay dividends. The decline in 2000 resulted from lower net income, after adjusting for noncash items, partially offset by lower working capital requirements. Investing Activities DTE Energys consolidated net cash used for investing activities increased $1.6 billion in 2001 and decreased $38 million in 2000. The increase in 2001 was due primarily to the acquisition of MCN Energy in May 2001 and the capital expenditures in regulated and non regulated businesses, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets. The higher regulated capital expenditures at Detroit Edison are attributable to new air quality regulations, which require the reduction in nitrogen oxide levels as discussed in the Environmental Matters section that follows. The decline in 2000 is attributable to a reduction in restricted cash. Financing Activities DTE Energys consolidated net cash related to financing activities increased $2 billion in 2001 and decreased $159 million in 2000. The increase in 2001 was due primarily to the issuance of $1.75 billion of securitization bonds and the issuance of $1.35 billion of long term debt to finance the cash consideration portion of the acquisition of MCN Energy. Proceeds from the securitization bonds were used to repay debt and repurchase approximately $424 million of DTE Energy common stock. In addition, Detroit Edison issued $840 million of long term debt. These proceeds, coupled with proceeds from securitization, were used for general corporate purposes including the redemption of $1.27 billion of higher cost debt, of which $1.11 billion represented unscheduled redemptions. MichCon issued $200 million of long term debt and used the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the redempton of $40 million of unscheduled 31 Table of Contents debt. Net cash used for financing activities was lower in 2000 due to decreased redemptions of long term debt, partially offset by repurchases of common stock. During 2001, the Company, Detroit Edison and MichCon entered into a bank facility arrangement used to support commercial paper in the amounts of $800 million, $300 million and $300 million, respectively. Commercial paper is usually issued in lieu of an equivalent amount of borrowings under these lines of credit. Amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2001, were $423 million at the Company and $254 million at MichCon. Outlook DTE Energys strategic direction will result in capital investments and expenditures in 2002 totaling approximately $950 million, of which approximately $200 million will be in non regulated businesses and the remaining $750 million in regulated electric and gas operations. Approximately $200 million of the regulated capital expenditures will be incurred by Detroit Edison to comply with new ozone and air quality regulations. The proposed level of investments and expenditures in future years is expected to be financed primarily with internally generated funds, proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets and debt. DTE Energys capitalization objective is to maintain its strong credit ratings through a strong balance sheet. Its capitalization objective is a 50% 55% leverage target. Management believes that the Company and its subsidiaries will have sufficient capital resources to meet anticipated capital requirements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DTE Energy has operations within six business segments. There are three key types of transactions presented in the consolidated financial statements that require considerable judgment and estimation. Such transactions relate to regulatory assets and liabilities, risk management and trading activities and alternate fuels tax credits. Regulation A significant portion of the Companys business is subject to regulation. Detroit Edisons electric distribution operations, MichCons gas distribution and transportation operations and the transmission operations of International Transmission Company (ITC) currently meet the criteria of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, which results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non regulated businesses. SFAS No. 71 requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue and expense in non regulated businesses. Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the Company discontinuing the application of SFAS No. 71 for some or all of its businesses and require the write off of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability that was no longer probable of recovery or refund. If Detroit Edison (excluding its subsidiary, The Detroit Edison Securitization Funding LLC) were to have discontinued the application of SFAS No. 71 for all of its operations as of December 31, 2001, it would have had an extraordinary noncash charge to income of approximately $58 million. If MichCon were to have discontinued the application of SFAS No. 71, it would have had an extraordinary noncash increase to income of approximately $60 million. There would be no significant impact to earnings if ITC were to discontinue its application of SFAS No. 71. Management believes that 32 Table of Contents currently available facts support the continued application of SFAS No. 71 and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the current rate environment. Risk Management and Trading Activities All derivatives are recorded at fair value and shown as Assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities in the consolidated statement of financial position. Risk management activities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Trading activities are accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. Except for the activities of the Wholesale Marketing Trading segment, the Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. The offsetting entry to Assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities is to other comprehensive income or earnings depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair values of derivative contracts are adjusted each accounting period for changes in the market and are derived from: i) published exchange traded market data; ii) prices from external sources; and iii) prices based on valuation models. Market quotes are more readily available for short duration contracts. The Company has derivative contracts extending to 2016. Alternate Fuels Tax Credits DTE Energy generated $165 million in alternate fuels tax credits in 2001, up from $130 million in 2000 and $116 million in 1999. Outside firms assist the Company in calculating the tax credits and evaluating their realizability. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Protecting the environment from damage, as well as correcting past environmental damage, continues to be a focus of state and federal regulators. Legislation and or rulemaking could further impact the electric utility industry including Detroit Edison. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality have aggressive programs regarding the clean up of contaminated property. The EPA initiated enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations of new source provisions of the Clean Air Act. Detroit Edison received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject. The EPA has not initiated proceedings against Detroit Edison. The National Energy Policy Development Group has undertaken a review of the EPAs interpretation of regulations applying to new source review requirements. The Company expects this review to focus on the ability of fossil fueled plant owners to perform plant maintenance without additional significant environmentally related modifications. While the Company anticipates a continued ability to economically maintain its plants, the outcome of this governmental review cannot be predicted. EPA ozone transport regulations and final new air quality standards relating to ozone and particulate air pollution will impact the Company. Detroit Edison has spent approximately $221 33 Table of Contents million through December 2001 and estimates that it will incur approximately $400 million to $500 million of future capital expenditures over the next three years to comply. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The most significant change made by SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations. The most significant changes made by SFAS No. 142 are that the amortization of goodwill will cease, and goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be tested for impairment at least annually. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. This statement requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This statement establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies for a further discussion of these pronouncements. 34 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table reflects the payments due by period for the Companys contractual obligations existing at December 31, 2001: Payments Due by Period (in Millions) Less Than After Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Long Term Debt: Mortgage bonds, notes other $ 6,321 $ 429 $ 668 $ 930 $ 4,294 Securitization bonds 1,746 73 177 201 1,295 Capital Lease Obligations 147 21 27 25 74 Operating Leases 102 19 34 22 27 Unconditional Purchase Obligations 2,405 552 753 315 785 Other Long Term Obligations 671 15 293 29 334 Total Obligations $ 11,392 $ 1,109 $ 1,952 $ 1,522 $ 6,809 The Company expects that its 2002 capital expenditures will approximate $950 million. Certain commitments have been made in connection with such capital expenditures and are excluded from the above table. FAIR VALUE OF CONTRACTS The following table reflects the maturity and sources of the net fair value gain (loss) of contracts at December 31, 2001: 35 Table of Contents Maturity Maturity Maturity Maturity Total (in Millions) Less Than 1 3 4 5 Exceeding Fair 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Value Trading Activities Prices From: Quotes $ 32 $ 5 $ 4 $ $ 41 External sources 14 14 Other sources 3 1 4 $ 46 $ 8 $ 5 $ 59 Risk Management Activities (248 ) Total Assets & Liabilities from Risk Management and Trading Activities $ (189 ) The Prices from quotes category represents the Companys positions for which forward price curves were developed using published NYMEX exchange prices and over the counter (OTC) gas and power quotes. The NYMEX currently publishes gas futures prices for the next six years. The Prices from external sources category represents the Companys forward positions in power at points for which OTC broker quotes are not always directly available. The Company values these positions against internally developed forward market price curves that are constantly validated and recalibrated against OTC broker quotes for closely correlated points. This category also includes strip transactions whose prices are obtained from external sources and then modeled to daily or monthly prices as appropriate. The Prices from other sources category contains the value of transactions for which an internally developed price curve was constructed as a result of the long dated nature of the transaction or the illiquidity of the market point. A reconciliation of the Companys estimated net fair value of trading contracts follows: (in Millions) Fair value at January 1, 2001 $ 17 Plus: contracts acquired upon acquisition of MCN Energy 12 Less: contracts realized during 2001 (33 ) Other changes in fair value 63 Fair value at December 31, 2001 $ 59 36 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk Risk Management Activities Detroit Edison is subject to commodity price risk in conjunction with the anticipated purchase of electricity to meet reliability obligations during times of peak customer demand. Detroit Edisons exposure to commodity price risk arises from market fluctuations in commodity prices. To limit the sensitivity to commodity price fluctuations, Detroit Edison has entered into a series of forward electricity contracts and option contracts. See Note 13 Financial and Other Derivative Instruments herein for a further discussion of these derivative instruments. The Company is exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations on gas sale and purchase contracts, gas production and gas inventories. To manage this risk, the Company uses natural gas futures, options, forwards and swap agreements. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis to calculate the impact of changes in fair values utilizing applicable forward commodity rates in effect at December 31, 2001. The Company estimates that if commodity prices were 10% higher or lower, the net fair value of commodity contracts would increase $24 million and decrease $35 million, respectively. Trading Activities Wholesale Marketing Trading markets and trades electricity, gas and related fuels, in addition to providing price risk management services using energy commodity derivatives. Wholesale Marketing Trading performed a sensitivity analysis to calculate the impact of changes in fair values utilizing applicable forward commodity rates in effect at December 31, 2001. The Company estimates that if commodity prices were 10% higher or lower, the fair value of commodity contracts would decrease $8.4 million and increase $8.0 million, respectively. Credit Risk Electricity and gas is purchased from and sold to numerous companies operating in the steel, automotive, energy and retail industries. A number of customers have filed for bankruptcy in 2001, including certain Enron Corporation affiliates. Certain DTE Energy subsidiaries had open transactions under a variety of agreements with bankrupt Enron affiliates and such subsidiaries had an aggregate net liability of $24 million to Enron. There are various netting agreements with Enron affiliates. Internal and external counsel are working to determine the Companys rights within these agreements. The Company has not reserved for any of its exposure, in addition to the net liabilities already recorded, as management cannot estimate a probable loss exposure and currently does not believe the resolution of this matter will have a material impact to the Company. National Steel Company (NSC), customer of the Company, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on March 6, 2002. The Company has pre petition receivables of $35 million from NSC relating to electricity sales by Detroit Edison and coke and pulverized coal sales from its Energy Services segment. No formal motion to assume or reject the coke sales agreement or pulverized coal sales agreement has been filed by NSC with the Bankruptcy Court. The Company currently believes that the coke sales agreement and the pulverized coal sales agreement will be assumed by NSC and that all pre petition amounts due, including regulated electricity sales, will be paid in full. 37 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The Company estimates that if interest rates were 10% higher or lower, the fair value of long term debt at December 31, 2001 would decrease $234 million and increase $217 million, respectively. 38 Table of Contents
