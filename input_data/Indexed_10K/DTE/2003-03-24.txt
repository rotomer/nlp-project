Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Diluted Earnings Per Share Increased Our earnings in 2002 were $632 million, or $3.83 per diluted share, compared to earnings of $332 million, or $2.16 per diluted share in 2001. The comparability of earnings was affected by merger and restructuring charges and goodwill amortization associated with the MCN Energy merger that reduced 2001 after tax earnings by $204 million, or $1.32 per diluted share. Excluding merger and restructuring charges and goodwill amortization, operating earnings increased $96 million or $.35 per diluted share in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase was due to improved margins in our regulated Energy Resources business, a full year of contributions from our Energy Gas business that was acquired in May 2001 in conjunction with the MCN Energy acquisition and increased contribution from our non regulated businesses, primarily synfuels. Partially offsetting these improvements were higher operation and maintenance expenses, and interest expense. The issuance of 29 million shares of DTE Energy common stock in conjunction with the May 2001 MCN Energy acquisition, net of 10.5 million shares repurchased in 2001, and the issuance of 6.325 million shares in June 2002, also impacted the earnings per share comparison. Earnings in 2001 decreased $136 million, or $1.11 per diluted share from 2000. As previously discussed, the earnings decline was due to significant merger and restructuring charges and goodwill amortization recorded in 2001. Additionally, merger and restructuring charges were recorded in 2000 reducing income by $16 million, or $.12 per diluted share. Excluding merger and restructuring charges and goodwill amortization, earnings increased $52 million, or $.09 per diluted share in 2001 compared to 2000. The improvement in earnings primarily reflects contributions from our Energy Gas business and from our non regulated businesses. Partially offsetting these improvements were increased interest on long term debt and lower margins from regulated electricity operations. Strategic direction We are committed to increasing our annual earnings at a 6% average rate. Our growth strategy is to strengthen the core electric and gas utilities, add to our portfolio of non regulated businesses and leverage investments in energy technology. Non regulated growth is expected to shift over the next few years from profits from tax advantaged coal based fuels businesses that generate Section 29 tax credits to growth from energy technologies, on site energy projects, generation projects, energy trading, coal services, waste coal recovery and coal bed methane. We operate our businesses through three strategic business units (Energy Resources, Energy Distribution and Energy Gas). Each business unit has regulated and non regulated operations. The balance of our business consists of Corporate Other. Based on this structure, we set strategic goals, allocate resources and evaluate performance. 27 Table of Contents 2002 2001(1) 2000 (in Millions, except per share data) Net Income (Loss) Energy Resources Regulated Power Generation $ 241 $ 183 $ 252 Non regulated Energy Services 182 115 100 Energy Marketing Trading 25 44 10 Other 7 6 (7 ) Total Non regulated 214 165 103 455 348 355 Energy Distribution Regulated Power Distribution Transmission 153 186 175 Non regulated (16 ) (10 ) (10 ) 137 176 165 Energy Gas Regulated Gas Distribution 66 15 Non regulated 26 11 92 26 Corporate Other (52 ) (14 ) (36 ) Total Regulated 460 384 427 Non regulated (2) 172 152 57 632 536 484 Merger and Restructuring Charges (175 ) (16 ) MCN Energy Merger Goodwill Amortization (29 ) $ 632 $ 332 $ 468 Diluted Earnings Per Share Regulated $ 2.79 $ 2.50 $ 2.99 Non regulated (2) 1.04 .98 .40 3.83 3.48 3.39 Merger and Restructuring Charges (1.13 ) (.12 ) MCN Energy Merger Goodwill Amortization (.19 ) $ 3.83 $ 2.16 $ 3.27 (1) 2001 earnings were favorably impacted by $3 million, or $.02 per share, due to an accounting change.

Electricity is generated from Detroit Edisons numerous fossil plants, its hydroelectric pumped storage plant and its nuclear plant and sold principally throughout Michigan and the Midwest to residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale customers. Factors impacting income: Power Generation earnings increased $58 million in 2002 and decreased $69 million in 2001, compared to the prior year. As subsequently discussed, these results reflect changes in gross margins, increased operation and maintenance expenses, lower depreciation and amortization expenses and reduced property taxes. 28 Table of Contents 2002 2001 2000 (in Millions) Operating Revenues $ 2,711 $ 2,788 $ 2,911 Fuel and Purchased Power (1,048 ) (1,231 ) (1,242 ) Gross Margin 1,663 1,557 1,669 Operation and Maintenance (1) (626 ) (571 ) (492 ) Depreciation and Amortization (331 ) (385 ) (468 ) Taxes other than Income (156 ) (148 ) (176 ) Operating Income 550 453 533 Other Income and (Deductions) (189 ) (184 ) (161 ) Income Tax Provision (120 ) (83 ) (120 ) Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change (Note 15) (3 ) Net Income $ 241 $ 183 $ 252 Operating Income as a Percent of Operating Revenues 20 % 16 % 18 % (1) Excludes merger and restructuring charges in 2001 and 2000. Gross margins in 2002 improved $106 million due primarily to significantly lower purchased power costs, partially offset by reduced operating revenues. Average purchased power cost per unit in 2002 declined $39.08 per Megawatthour (MWh) from 2001 levels. The decline in revenues was due to a full year impact of a 5% legislatively mandated rate reduction for commercial and industrial customers that began in April 2001. Revenues from wholesale customers were reduced reflecting lower power prices. Revenues from retail customers were affected by customers switching to alternative suppliers under the electric Customer Choice program (Note 6). Partially offsetting these revenue reductions was the impact of weather, resulting in a 10% increase in cooling demand during 2002. Gross margins in 2001 declined by $112 million reflecting lower operating revenues, slightly offset by lower fuel and purchased power costs. The reduced operating revenues were due to the impact of an economic recession, the electric Customer Choice program and securitization. Sales rates for commercial and industrial customers were lowered by the 5% rate reduction in April 2001. Commercial and industrial sales decreased due to increased participation of customers in the electric Customer Choice program. Industrial sales also reflect reduced auto and steel production, and the end of a special energy sales agreement with a large steel manufacturer in March of 2001. Partially offsetting these declines were increased revenues from residential and wholesale customers as well as higher revenues from providing other energy related services. Residential customer revenues reflect higher demand resulting from weather, partially offset by the impact of a 5% rate reduction that began in June 2000. Revenues from wholesale customers increased due to gains from settling forward sales contracts. The sales contracts were entered into to effectively close forward purchase contracts that hedged power supply costs. Accordingly, the gains from forward sales contracts were substantially offset by losses from forward purchase contracts, which are recorded as part of fuel and purchased power costs. Fuel and purchased power costs were also affected by lower system output resulting from reduced electric sales, as well as the result of using a more favorable power supply mix. The supply mix reflects an increased usage of lower cost power from our generating plants and reduced usage of higher cost purchased power. 29 Table of Contents 2002 2001 2000 (in Thousands of MWh) Power Generated and Purchased Power Plant Generation Fossil Coal 37,381 64 % 38,424 69 % 40,039 67 % Natural Gas 1,414 2 1,283 2 1,667 3 Other 222 1 4 394 1 Nuclear (Fermi 2) 9,301 16 8,555 16 8,239 14 48,318 83 48,266 87 50,339 85 Purchased Power 9,807 17 7,482 13 8,877 15 System Output 58,125 100 % 55,748 100 % 59,216 100 % Average Unit Cost ($/MWh) Generation (1) $ 12.53 $ 12.31 $ 12.78 Purchased Power (2) $ 39.16 $ 78.24 $ 62.57 Overall Average Unit Cost $ 17.02 $ 21.15 $ 20.24 (1) Represents fuel costs associated with power plants. (2) Includes amounts associated with hedging activities. Operation and maintenance expense increased $55 million in 2002 and $79 million in 2001. Expense in both periods reflect an increase in planned and unplanned maintenance and reliability work for our power generation facilities, which reduces random outages at power plants and our reliance on purchased power. Additionally, both periods include higher employee pension and health care benefit costs, costs allocated from DTE Energy corporate for corporate support services, as well as the cost of funding the low income and energy efficiency fund. The funding of the low income and energy efficiency program was required under Michigan legislation and is recovered in current sales rates. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $54 million in 2002 and $83 million in 2001. The declines reflect the extension of the amortization period from seven years to 14 years for certain regulatory assets that were securitized in 2001. See Note 6 Regulatory Matters. Taxes other than income increased $8 million in 2002 and decreased $28 million in 2001. The 2001 decrease was due to lower property taxes resulting from new valuation tables approved by the Michigan State Tax Commission (STC). Several local taxing jurisdictions have taken legal action against the state of Michigan to prevent the STC from implementing the new valuation tables. See Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies. Outlook Electric restructuring is expected to continue to result in increased customer choice in the retail electric generation business. Effective January 1, 2002, the electric Customer Choice program in Michigan was expanded to allow all electric customers to purchase their electricity from suppliers other than their local utility. As a result of customers choosing to participate in the electric Customer Choice program Detroit Edison lost 6% of retail sales in 2002 and estimates losing 10% to 13% of such sales in 2003. If Detroit Edison is unable to recover its fixed costs from retail customers due to lost sales under electric Customer Choice (stranded costs), Michigan law allows for the recovery of all such amounts from electric Customer Choice customers. Detroit Edison recorded a $21 million regulatory asset in 2002 representing stranded costs and other recoverable costs under Michigan legislation. The regulatory asset was calculated based on a refinement to the methodology approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC). The regulatory asset will be subject to review in future regulatory proceedings and we cannot predict the outcome of this matter. See Note 6 Regulatory Matters. Operating results are expected to vary as a result of various external factors such as weather, changes in economic conditions and the level of customer participation in the electric Customer Choice program. 30 Table of Contents Energy Services Energy Services is comprised of Coal Based Fuels, On Site Energy Projects and Merchant Generation. Coal Based Fuels operations include producing synthetic fuel from nine synfuel plants and producing coke from three coke battery plants. Both processes generate tax credits under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. On Site Energy Projects include pulverized coal, power generation, steam production, chilled water, wastewater treatment and compressed air. Merchant Generation owns and operates four gas fired peaking electric generating plants and develops and acquires gas and coal fired generation. 2002 2001 2000 (in Millions) Operating Revenues Coal Based Fuels $ 599 $ 365 $ 293 On Site Energy Projects 63 53 33 Merchant Generation 20 16 12 682 434 338 Fuel and Purchased Power (380 ) (116 ) (61 ) Operation and Maintenance (320 ) (323 ) (260 ) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (23 ) (36 ) (29 ) Taxes other than Income (14 ) (6 ) (1 ) Operating Loss (55 ) (47 ) (13 ) Other Income and (Deductions) (27 ) (11 ) (15 ) Income Tax Benefit 264 173 128 Net Income $ 182 $ 115 $ 100 Factors impacting income: Earnings increased $67 million in 2002 and $15 million in 2001. Both periods reflect an increase in synfuel production, partially offset by a reduction in coke battery ownership. Four new synfuel production facilities became operational in 2002, compared to three new facilities in 2001. We sold a 95% interest in two of our synfuel projects during 2002. Tax credits from coke battery production decreased in both years reflecting the sale of a 49% interest in two of our coke battery projects in 2001. In 2002, consistent with the original purchase and sale agreement, our interest in the third coke battery was reduced from 95% to 5%. Operating revenues and expenses increased significantly in 2002 and 2001 reflecting higher synfuel production. Synfuel projects generate operating losses which are offset by the resulting tax credits.

We continue to evaluate opportunities to sell interests in some or all of our synfuel plants. Sales of interests in synfuel projects allow us to accelerate cash flow while maintaining a stable net income base. Coke battery tax credits expired at two of our three facilities in 2002 and the synfuel tax credits are scheduled to expire in 2007. Energy Marketing Trading Energy Marketing Trading consists of the electric and gas marketing and trading operations of DTE Energy Trading Company and CoEnergy Trading Company, which was acquired as part of the MCN Energy acquisition in May 2001. Energy Marketing Trading focuses on physical power marketing and structured transactions, as well as the enhancement of returns from DTE Energys natural gas pipeline and storage assets. To this end, Energy Marketing Trading enters into forwards, futures, swaps and option contracts as part of its trading strategy. Factors impacting income: Earnings decreased $19 million in 2002 and increased $34 million in 2001 due to varying mark to market gains resulting from changes in gas and electric prices. Commodity price risk of the Energy Marketing Trading segment is managed by utilizing derivative financial contracts to offset the risk inherent in the segments portfolio of electric and gas supply and sales agreements. The segments objective is to enter into new transactions that can be hedged and profitable from an economic standpoint. Energy Marketing Trading accounts for this risk minimization strategy by marking to market its commodity forwards and financial derivatives so they substantially offset. This fair value accounting better aligns financial reporting with the way the business is managed and its performance measured. In 2001, Energy Marketing Trading experienced earnings volatility as a result of its production related gas supply as well as from open positions related to its long term gas transportation and storage assets. The segment receives gas produced from DTE Energys Exploration Production (EP) operations which is used to meet its commitments under long term contracts with cogeneration customers. The EP gas does not qualify for mark to market accounting. Energy Marketing Trading recorded a gain in 2001 totaling approximately $50 million, net of taxes, primarily attributable to marking to market sales contracts with power generation customers without recording an offsetting loss from marking to market the production related gas supply. In December 2001, Energy Marketing Trading entered into hedge transactions that substantially mitigate the earnings volatility related to the gas contracts with power generation customers. Energy Marketing Trading deploys a gas storage, marketing and trading strategy primarily utilizing the facilities owned and operated by DTE Energy. Employing a combination of physical and financial contracts, in conjunction with the injection and withdrawal capabilities of the storage fields, the segment is able to capture seasonal price spreads. As forward prices change, the timing of the physical flow of gas is optimized to obtain the highest margin. Trades under this strategy are marked to market against the forward curve. Through December 2002, physical gas in storage was marked to the current spot price under fair value accounting rules. This difference in accounting for forward trades and gas in storage resulted in earnings volatility in 2002 and 2001 when price changes in the spot month did not correspond with those in future delivery months. Gas in storage in December 2002 was priced at a spot market rate of $5.10 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), compared to $2.77 per Mcf in December 2001 and a May 31, 2001, acquisition date rate of $4.10 per Mcf. Significantly smaller changes in forward prices occurred during these same periods. As a result, the mark to market gains and losses on gas inventory were only partially offset by mark to market losses and gains on the storage related derivatives. Outlook Energy Marketing Trading will seek to gradually expand this business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments. Gas storage and 32 Table of Contents transportation capacity enhances its ability to provide reliable and custom tailored, bundled services to large volume end users and utilities. This capacity, coupled with the synergies from DTE Energys other businesses, positions the segment to capitalize on opportunities for expansion of its market base. Energy Marketing Trading manages commodity price risk by utilizing derivative financial contracts to more fully balance its portfolio of gas and electric supply and sales agreements. Energy Marketing Trading attempts to maintain a balanced, or flat book from an economic standpoint. However, Energy Marketing Trading will experience earnings volatility as a result of its gas inventories and associated hedges. As discussed in Note 2, effective January 1, 2003, gas inventory does not qualify for mark to market accounting as a result of the rescission of Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 98 10. Non regulated Other Our other non regulated businesses are comprised of our Coal Services and Biomass units. Coal Services specializes in minimizing energy production costs and maximizing reliability of supply for energy intensive use customers. Biomass develops, owns and operates landfill recovery systems in the U.S. Gas produced from these landfill sites qualifies for Section 29 tax credits. Factors impacting income: Earnings rose $1 million in 2002 and $13 million in 2001, reflecting higher revenues from an increase in the shipment of coal, as well as an increase in revenues and tax credits resulting from an increase in gas produced. Outlook We expect to continue to grow our Coal Services and Biomass units. Biomass currently has 30 operating sites and other projects under development. Section 29 tax credits related to Biomass operations expire in 2007. ENERGY DISTRIBUTION Power Distribution Transmission Power Distribution Transmission operations include the electric distribution services and steam heating businesses of Detroit Edison, and the electric transmission services of the International Transmission Company (ITC). Energy Distribution distributes electricity generated by Energy Resources and alternative electric suppliers to Detroit Edisons 2.1 million customers. 2002 2001 2000 (in Millions) Operating Revenues $ 1,365 $ 1,263 $ 1,218 Fuel and Purchased Power (26 ) (10 ) (29 ) Operation and Maintenance (1) (568 ) (477 ) (460 ) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (268 ) (259 ) (251 ) Taxes other than Income (135 ) (126 ) (113 ) Operating Income 368 391 365 Other Income and (Deductions) (135 ) (131 ) (129 ) Income Tax Provision (80 ) (74 ) (61 ) Net Income $ 153 $ 186 $ 175 Operating Income as a Percent of Operating Revenues 27 % 31 % 30 % (1) Excludes merger and restructuring charges in 2001 and 2000. Factors impacting income: Earnings decreased $33 million in 2002 and increased $11 million in 2001. The 2002 decrease is due primarily to increased operating and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher operating revenue. Operation and maintenance expenses were affected by expenses associated with restoring power to customers who lost service during two catastrophic storms during 2002, as well as 33 Table of Contents heat related maintenance expenses due to prolonged periods of above normal summer temperatures and the related stress placed on the distribution system. Additionally, operation and maintenance expenses reflect increased costs associated with customer service process improvements, uncollectible accounts expense, and employee benefit expenses. Operating revenues increased due primarily to higher residential sales attributable to greater cooling demand. The 2001 earnings improvement is due primarily to higher residential sales resulting from weather, partially offset by the impact of a 5% rate reduction that began in June 2000. Below are volumes associated with the regulated power distribution and transmission business: 2002 2001 2000 (in Thousands of MWh) Electric Deliveries Residential 15,958 14,503 13,903 Commercial 18,395 18,777 19,762 Industrial 13,590 14,430 16,090 Wholesale 2,249 2,159 2,277 50,192 49,869 52,032 Electric Choice 3,510 1,268 202 Total Electric Deliveries 53,702 51,137 52,234 Outlook Regulated electric system deliveries are expected to continue to increase in 2003 due to continued territory and economic growth. Operating results are expected to vary as a result of various external factors such as weather, changes in economic conditions and the severity and frequency of storms. In January 2003, we sold our steam business and will record a net of tax loss in the 2003 first quarter of approximately $13 million. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we entered into an agreement to sell ITC for $610 million. The sale closed on February 28, 2003 and generated a net of tax gain of approximately $75 million. Several Midwest utilities seek to recover lost transmission revenues associated with the creation of multiple regional transmission organizations in the Midwest. Positions advocated by several parties in a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proceeding could require that Detroit Edison and its customers be responsible for increased transmission costs. Detroit Edison continues to actively participate in this proceeding and depending upon the outcome would subsequently seek rate recovery of these costs. Non Regulated Non regulated energy distribution operations consist primarily of DTE Energy Technologies that markets and distributes a broad portfolio of distributed generation products, provides application engineering, and monitors and manages system operations. Factors impacting income: Losses increased $6 million during 2002 due primarily to expenses associated with the establishment of new sales offices in the distributed generation business. Outlook DTE Energy Technologies expects to continue the expansion of its product portfolios and support capabilities in North America and the development of marketing relationships in other parts of the world. We plan to develop and launch new products in 2003 that are critical to our plan to increase revenues and generate operating profits by 2004. 34 Table of Contents ENERGY GAS Gas Distribution Gas Distribution operations include gas distribution services primarily provided by MichCon, our gas utility that purchases, stores and distributes natural gas to 1.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers located throughout Michigan. 2002 2001 2000 (in Millions) Operating Revenues $ 1,369 $ 615 $ Fuel and Purchased Power (774 ) (304 ) Gross Margins 595 311 Operation and Maintenance (1) (297 ) (194 ) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (104 ) (61 ) Taxes other than Income (51 ) (24 ) Operating Income 143 32 Other Income and (Deductions) (41 ) (38 ) Income Tax Benefit (Provision) (36 ) 21 Net Income $ 66 $ 15 $ Operating Income as a Percent of Operating Revenues 10 % 5 % % (1) Excludes merger and restructuring charges in 2001 and 2000. Factors impacting income: Gas Distribution had income of $66 million in 2002 compared to $15 million in 2001. The significant improvement in 2002 reflects a full year of operations from MichCon, which was acquired in conjunction with the MCN Energy merger in May 2001. In contrast to 2001, the 2002 results include the January through April period when demand for natural gas is at its highest. Warmer than normal weather during 2002 and 2001 reduced Gas Distributions earnings by $11 million and $13 million, respectively. Operations and maintenance expenses in 2002 were affected by higher uncollectible accounts expense, employee benefit expenses, and costs associated with customer service process improvements. The pro forma impact of the MCN Energy acquisition on DTE Energy is discussed in Note 4 Acquisitions and Dispositions. Outlook Gas restructuring is expected to continue to result in increased customer choice in the gas sales business. In December 2001, the MPSC issued an order that continues the gas Customer Choice program on a permanent and expanding basis beginning with the conclusion of the three year temporary program on March 31, 2002. Under the expanded program, beginning April 1, 2002, up to approximately 40% of customers could elect to purchase gas from suppliers other than MichCon. Beginning in April 2003, up to approximately 60% of customers could participate and beginning April 2004, all 1.2 million of MichCons gas customers could choose to participate. Since MichCon continues to transport and deliver the gas to the participating customer premises at prices comparable to margins earned on gas sales, customers switching to other suppliers have little impact on MichCons earnings. As of December 2002, approximately 190,000 customers were participating in the gas Customer Choice program. 35 Table of Contents Under the MPSC order, MichCon returned to a gas cost recovery (GCR) mechanism upon termination of its three year experimental Gas Sales Program in December 2001. Under the GCR mechanism, the gas commodity component of MichCons sales rates is designed to recover the actual costs of gas purchases. In December 2001, the MPSC issued an order permitting MichCon to implement GCR factors up to $3.62 per Mcf for January 2002 billings and up to $4.38 per Mcf for the remainder of 2002. The order also allowed MichCon to recognize a regulatory asset of approximately $14 million representing the difference between the $4.38 factor and the $3.62 factor for volumes that were unbilled at December 31, 2001. The regulatory asset will be subject to the 2002 GCR reconciliation process. In July 2002, in response to a petition for rehearing filed by the Michigan Attorney General, the MPSC directed the parties to address MichCons implementation of the December 2001 order and the impact of that implementation on rates charged to MichCons customers. Also, in July 2002, an MPSC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued a Proposal for Decision on MichCons 2002 GCR plan case. In that decision the ALJ recommended adoption of the MPSC Staffs proposed $26.5 million reduction in gas cost due to MichCons decision to utilize storage gas during 2001 that resulted in a gas inventory decrement for the 2001 calendar year. On March 12, 2003, the MPSC ordered MichCon to reduce revenues by $26.5 million for purposes of calculating the 2002 GCR expense in the 2002 GCR reconciliation proceeding. See Note 6 Regulatory Matters Gas Industry Restructuring and Note 22 Subsequent Event Regulatory Matters Gas Industry Restructuring. Gas Distributions future operating results will vary as a result of weather and changes in economic conditions. Non regulated Non regulated operations include the gas and oil Exploration Production business, and the gas Pipelines Processing business. EP produces gas from proven reserves owned in northern Michigan and sells the gas to the Energy Marketing Trading segment. Pipelines Processing has partnership interests in two interstate transmission pipelines, seven carbon dioxide processing facilities and a natural gas storage field. The assets of these businesses primarily support the Energy Marketing Trading segment. Factors impacting income: Earnings were $26 million in 2002 compared with $11 million in 2001. The results reflect a full year of operations of the EP and Pipeline Processing businesses that were acquired in conjunction with the MCN Energy acquisition in May 2001. Outlook We expect to further develop our gas production properties in northern Michigan and our pipelines, processing and storage assets to support other DTE Energy businesses. Additionally, we expect to continue exploring opportunities in the coal bed methane gas production business to leverage our EP capabilities, skills and experience. CORPORATE OTHER Corporate Other had a loss of $52 million in 2002 compared with a loss of $14 million in 2001. The increased loss was due to higher interest expense resulting from increased debt and a full year impact of corporate debt assumed in the MCN Energy acquisition. Additionally, results reflect a reserve of $11 million (pre tax) for the possible loss associated with direct loans to and the guarantee of debt of a technology investment. 36 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 2002 2001 2000 (in Millions) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash Flow From (Used For) Operating activities: Net income, depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 1,391 $ 1,127 $ 1,226 Merger and restructuring charges 215 Deferred income taxes (208 ) (7 ) (133 ) Working capital and other (209 ) (524 ) (78 ) 974 811 1,015 Investing activities (1) (1,115 ) (2,286 ) (674 ) Financing activities (2) 6 1,679 (310 ) Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ (135 ) $ 204 $ 31 (1) Includes acquisition of MCN Energy in 2001. (2) Includes $1.75 billion of securitization bonds issued in 2001. Operating Activities Our consolidated net cash from operating activities increased $163 million in 2002 and decreased $204 million in 2001. We use cash derived from operating activities to maintain and expand our core electric and gas utility businesses and to grow our non regulated businesses. In addition, we use cash from operations to retire long term debt and pay dividends. The increase in 2002 was attributable to higher net income, after adjusting for noncash items (depreciation, amortization and deferred taxes), partially offset by higher working capital requirements. Working capital requirements reflect an increase in accounts receivable and gas inventories. Accounts receivable collections were slowed in our utility business due to billing issues associated with our new combined billing system that have been resolved. The decline in 2001 resulted primarily from lower earnings, after adjusting for noncash items including merger and restructuring charges, and higher working capital requirements. Working capital was affected by the seasonal requirements in the second half of 2001 of the gas business where cash is used to finance increases in gas inventories and customer accounts receivable. Outlook We expect our cash flow from operations will increase in 2003 due to earnings growth, and by better managing our working capital requirements, including the continued focus of reducing past due accounts receivable. These expected improvements will be partially offset by a $222 million contribution to our pension plan in January 2003. Investing Activities Our net cash used for investing activities decreased $1.2 billion in 2002 and increased $1.6 billion in 2001. The cash consideration portion of the MCN Energy acquisition totaled $1.2 billion and impacts the comparison of the periods. In 2002, capital expenditures in regulated and non regulated businesses were lower, partially offset by reduced proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets. In 2001, higher regulated capital expenditures at Detroit Edison were due to new air quality regulations that require reductions in nitrogen oxide levels as discussed in the following Environmental Matters section. Outlook Our strategic direction anticipates base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in 2003 totaling approximately $850 million, of which approximately $700 million will be in regulated gas and electric operations and the remaining $150 million in non regulated businesses. 37 Table of Contents Approximately $100 million of the regulated capital expenditures will be incurred by our Power Generation business to comply with new ozone and air quality regulations. Investments in new non regulated growth businesses could push actual capital investments and expenditures over $1 billion. The actual level of non regulated investments and expenditures will depend on new market opportunities. We also sold ITC in 2003 for approximately $610 million. The proposed level of investments and expenditures in future years is expected to be financed primarily with internally generated funds, including proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets. We will evaluate divesting of assets and investments that do not meet certain return criteria or are not consistent with our strategic direction to maximize shareholder value. We believe that we will have sufficient capital resources, both internal and external, to meet anticipated capital requirements. Financing Activities Our consolidated net cash related to financing activities decreased $1.7 billion in 2002 and increased $2 billion in 2001. The 2001 issuance of $1.75 billion of securitization bonds and the 2001 issuance of $1.35 billion of long term debt to finance the acquisition of MCN Energy impacts the comparison of the periods. In 2002, proceeds from the issuance of debt and common stock were used for the redemption of higher cost debt and to reduce short term borrowings. In 2001, proceeds from the issuance of securitization bonds and other Detroit Edison and MichCon debt were used to repay debt and repurchase our common stock. Details of 2002 financing activities follows: In January 2002, DTE Energy Trust I, a wholly owned trust of the company, issued $180 million of 7.8% Trust Preferred Securities. The proceeds were used to redeem the 8 5/8% Trust Originated Preferred Securities and the 9 3/8% Redeemable Cumulative Preferred Securities. In April 2002, DTE Energy issued $200 million of 6.65% senior notes, due 2009. The proceeds were used to retire MCN Energy Enterprises Remarketable Securities that had an aggregate principal amount of $100 million, and to reduce short term borrowings. In June 2002, DTE Energy issued 6.9 million equity linked security units at $25 per unit. An equity security unit consists of a stock purchase contract and a senior note of DTE Energy. DTE Energy used the net proceeds of $167 million from this issuance for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of short term borrowings. In June 2002, DTE Energy also issued 6.325 million shares of common stock at $43.25 per share, grossing $273.6 million. Net proceeds from the common stock offering were $265 million and were used for general corporate purposes. In October 2002, Detroit Edison issued $225 million of 5.20% senior notes, due 2012, and $225 million of 6.35% senior notes, due 2032. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including debt redemptions and the repayment of short term borrowings. In December 2002, Detroit Edison issued $64 million of 5.45% tax exempt bonds and $56 million of 5.25% tax exempt bonds, due 2032. The proceeds were used for the refunding of tax exempt bonds and to finance costs to be incurred for pollution control facilities at our power plants. In October 2002, DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon entered into separate revolving credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $1.2 billion. Our revolving credit facilities contain customary covenants. One important aspect of these agreements requires us to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of not more than .65 to 1, and an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest ratio of no less than 2 to 1. See Note 13 Short Term Credit Arrangements and Borrowings. 38 Table of Contents DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon have effective shelf registrations with the SEC that allow for the issuance of up to $1.9 billion of debt and equity securities. In February 2003, MichCon issued $200 million of 5.7% senior notes, due in 2033. The proceeds were used for debt redemption. Outlook Our capitalization objective is to maintain our credit ratings through a strong balance sheet. Our capitalization objective is a 50% to 55% leverage target (excluding certain debt, principally securitization debt.) We have issued guarantees for the benefit of various non regulated subsidiary transactions. We do not anticipate any credit rating downgrades, however in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade certain of these guarantees would require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately $200 million at December 31, 2002. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES There are estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements that require considerable judgment. Such estimates relate to regulation, risk management and trading activities, Section 29 tax credits, goodwill, pension and post retirement costs, and the allowance for doubtful accounts. Regulation A significant portion of our business is subject to regulation. Detroit Edison, MichCon and ITC currently meet the criteria of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Application of this standard results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non regulated businesses. SFAS No. 71 requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non regulated businesses. Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in discontinuing the application of SFAS No. 71 for some or all of our businesses. If we were to discontinue the application of SFAS No. 71 on all our operations, we estimate that the extraordinary noncash loss would be as follows: (in millions) Regulated Entity MichCon $ (28 ) Detroit Edison (1) (27 ) ITC (6 ) Total $ (61 ) (1) Excludes securitized regulatory assets Management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of SFAS No. 71 and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment. Risk Management and Trading Activities All derivatives are recorded at fair value and shown as Assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities in the consolidated statement of financial position. Risk management activities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Through December 2002, trading activities were accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. Effective January 2003, trading activities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133. See Note 2 New Accounting Pronouncements. 39 Table of Contents The offsetting entry to Assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities is to other comprehensive income or earnings depending on the use of the derivative, how it is designated and if it qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair values of derivative contracts were adjusted each reporting period for changes using market sources such as: published exchange traded market data prices from external sources price based on valuation models Market quotes are more readily available for short duration contracts. Effective in 2003, fair value measurements must be evidenced by similar transactions in the marketplace. Section 29 Tax Credits We have generated Section 29 tax credits from our synfuel, coke battery and biomass operations. Seven of our synthetic fuel facilities have received favorable private letter rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to their operations. The remaining two rulings have been requested and are expected in 2003. These tax credits are subject to review by the IRS and if we fail to prevail through the administrative and legal process, there could be a significant tax liability owed for previously taken Section 29 tax credits. Our portion of tax credits generated was $250 million in 2002, up from $165 million in 2001 and $130 million in 2000. Outside firms assist us in assuring we operate in accordance with our private letter rulings and within the parameters of the law, as well as calculating the value of tax credits. Goodwill Certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired. In order to perform these impairment tests, we must determine the reporting units fair value using valuation techniques, which use estimates of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit. These cash flow estimates involve judgments based on a broad range of information and historical results. To the extent estimated cash flows are revised downward, the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings. As of December 31, 2002, our goodwill totaled $2.1 billion and we determined that no impairment exists. Pension and Postretirement Costs Our cost of providing pension and postretirement benefits are dependent upon a number of factors, including rates of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of increase in health care costs. We had pension income for qualified pension plans of $9 million in 2002 and pension expense of $159 million in 2001 and $9 million in 2000. Postretirement benefits expense for all plans was $70 million in 2002, $104 million in 2001 and $44 million in 2000. Pension and postretirement benefits expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long term rate of return on our plan assets of 9.0% at December 31, 2002. In developing our expected long term rate of return assumption, we evaluated input from our consultants, including their review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond markets. Our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 65% in equity markets, 28% in fixed income markets, and 7% invested in other assets. Because of market volatility, we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate. Given market conditions we believe that 9% is a reasonable long term rate of return on our plan assets, despite the recent financial market downturn. We will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions, including our expected rate of return, at least annually. 40 Table of Contents We base our determination of the expected return on plan assets for pension benefits on a market related valuation of assets which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic manner over a three year period. Because of this method, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. We have unrecognized net losses due to the recent unfavorable performance of the financial markets. As of December 31, 2002, we had cumulative losses of approximately $375 million which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets. These unrecognized net losses may result in increases in our future pension expense. The discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency. The discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from 7.25% at December 31, 2001 to 6.75% at December 31, 2002. Due to recent financial market performance, lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates we estimate that our 2003 pension expense will approximate $70 million and our postretirement benefit expense will approximate $141 million. We have also made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings impact of the higher costs. Future actual pension and postretirement benefit expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design. Lowering the expected long term rate of return on our pension plan assets by 0.5% would have increased our 2002 pension expense by approximately $12 million and our postretirement benefit expense by $3 million. Lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by 0.5% would have increased our pension expense for 2002 by approximately $3 million. Lowering the discount rate and the health care cost trend assumptions by 0.5% would have decreased our postretirement benefit expense for 2002 by approximately $4 million. The market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets has been affected by sharp declines in the financial markets since 2000. The value of our plan assets has decreased from $2.8 billion at December 31, 2001, to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2002. The investment performance returns and declining discount rates have required us to recognize at December 31, 2002, an additional minimum pension liability of $855 million, an intangible asset of $57 million and an entry to other comprehensive loss (shareholders equity) of $518 million, net of tax. The additional minimum pension liability and related accounting entries would be reversed on the balance sheet in future periods if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated pension benefit obligations. The recording of the minimum pension liability does not affect net income or cash flow. Pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements will increase in future years without a substantial recovery in the financial markets. We made a $35 million cash contribution to the pension plan in 2002 and a $222 million cash contribution in January 2003. We also contributed $33 million to the postretirement plans in 2002, and expect to contribute at $80 million by the end of 2003. 41 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, economic conditions, age of receivables and other information. With the implementation of a new integrated billing system in late 2001, we encountered billing issues that resulted in an MPSC inquiry. We filed a plan with the MPSC in March 2002 addressing customer billing complaints. While we have resolved the primary billing issues, we may encounter difficulty in collecting past due receivables. As a result, our allowance for doubtful accounts increased in 2002. We believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates, however; failure to collect our past due receivables could unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Protecting the environment, as well as correcting past environmental damage, continues to be a focus of state and federal regulators. Legislation and (or) rulemaking could further impact the electric utility industry including Detroit Edison. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality have aggressive programs to clean up contaminated property. The EPA initiated enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations of new source provisions of the Clean Air Act. Detroit Edison received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject. The EPA has not initiated proceedings against Detroit Edison. The National Energy Policy Development Group is reviewing the EPAs interpretation and application of regulations for new source review requirements. We expect this review to focus on the ability of fossil fueled plant owners to perform plant maintenance without additional significant environmentally related modifications. While we anticipate continued ability to economically maintain our plants, the outcome of this governmental review cannot be predicted. EPA ozone transport regulations and final new air quality standards relating to ozone and particulate air pollution will impact us. Detroit Edison has spent approximately $460 million through December 2002 and estimates that it will incur approximately $300 million to $400 million of future capital expenditures over the next five to eight years to comply.

(2) Structured Contracts represent derivative activity transacted with the intent to capture profits by originating substantially hedged positions with wholesale energy marketers, utilities, retail aggregators and end users. Although transactions are generally executed with a buyer and seller simultaneously, some positions remain open until a suitable offsetting trade can be executed. (3) Owned Assets represent derivative activity associated with assets owned by DTE Energy, including forward sales of gas production and trades associated with owned transportation and storage capacity. Derivatives are generally executed with the intent of locking in and optimizing profits without creating additional risk. (4) Represents transportation contracts that no longer meet the definition of a derivative. The fair value of such contracts were frozen and are being amortized to income over the remaining contract terms. 43 Table of Contents Proprietary Structured Owned Trading Contracts Assets Eliminations Total (in Millions) Current assets $ 62 $ 68 $ 65 $ (10 ) $ 185 Noncurrent assets 18 33 114 (16 ) 149 Total MTM assets 80 101 179 (26 ) 334 Current liabilities (49 ) (58 ) (96 ) 9 (194 ) Noncurrent liabilities (16 ) (24 ) (133 ) 17 (156 ) Total MTM liabilities (65 ) (82 ) (229 ) 26 (350 ) Total MTM net assets (liabilities) $ 15 $ 19 $ (50 ) $ $ (16 ) Maturity and source of fair value of MTM energy contract net assets The table below shows the maturity and source of how we derived the MTM positions of our energy contracts.

The NYMEX publishes gas futures prices for the next six years. (2) Prices by external sources represent our forward positions in power at points where OTC broker quotes are not always available. We value these positions against internally developed forward market price curves that are constantly validated and recalibrated against OTC broker quotes for closely correlated points. This category also includes strip transactions whose prices are obtained from external sources and then modeled to daily or monthly prices as appropriate. 44 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk Risk Management and Trading Activities DTE Energy has commodity price risk arising from market price fluctuations in conjunction with the anticipated purchase of electricity to meet its obligations during periods of peak demand. We also are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations on gas sale and purchase contracts, gas production and gas inventories. To limit our exposure to commodity price fluctuations, we have entered into a series of electricity and gas futures, forwards, option and swap contracts. See Note 15 Financial and Other Derivative Instruments for further discussion. Interest Rate Risk DTE Energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt and preferred securities. In order to manage interest costs, we use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements. Our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in U.S. Treasury rates, commercial paper rates and London Inter Bank Offered Rates (LIBOR). Summary of Sensitivity Analysis We performed a sensitivity analysis calculating the impact of changes in fair values utilizing applicable forward commodity rates or changes in interest rates if they occurred at December 31, 2002: (in Millions) Activity Increase of 10% Decrease of 10% Change in the fair value of Gas Contracts $ (21 ) $ 7 Commodity contracts Power Contracts $ 3 $ (1 ) Commodity contracts Interest Rate Risk $ (229 ) $ 245 Long term debt Credit Risk We purchase and sell electricity, gas and coke to numerous companies operating in the steel, automotive, energy and retail industries. During 2002 and 2001, a number of customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including certain Enron Corporation affiliates, National Steel Company and Bethlehem Steel Company. At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $65 million of accounts receivable and approximately $40 million of accounts payable with these bankrupt companies. We regularly review contingent matters relating to purchase and sale contracts and record provisions for amounts considered probable of loss. We believe our previously accrued amounts are adequate for probable losses. The final resolution of these matters are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements in the period they are resolved. 45 Table of Contents
