Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW DTE Energy is a diversified energy company with approximately $7 billion in revenues in 2003 and approximately $21 billion in assets at December 31, 2003. We are the parent company of Detroit Edison and MichCon, regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales and distribution services throughout southeastern Michigan. Additionally, we have numerous non regulated subsidiaries involved in energy related businesses predominantly in the Midwest and eastern U.S. The majority of our earnings are derived from utility operations and the production of synthetic fuel, which qualifies for Section 29 tax credits. Earnings in 2003 were $521 million, or $3.09 per diluted share, down from 2002 earnings of $632 million, or $3.83 per diluted share. Earnings from continuing operations in 2003 were $480 million, or $2.85 per diluted share, compared to 2002 earnings from continuing operations of $586 million, or $3.55 per diluted share. The 18% decrease in income reflects significantly lower utility earnings, partially offset by increased contributions from our non regulated businesses. Our 2003 financial performance was primarily influenced by: Weather, including storms and power outages; Lost revenues from electric Customer Choice penetration; The regulatory environment in Michigan and the need to increase utility rates; Higher operating costs; The optimization of Section 29 tax credits; and Growth of non regulated businesses Weather Earnings in our electric and gas utilities are seasonal and extremely sensitive to weather. Electric utility earnings are dependent on hot summer weather while the gas utilitys results are driven by cold winter weather. We experienced both milder summer and winter weather during 2003, which negatively impacted sales demand. The lower demand reduced current year earnings by $64 million compared to 2002, which was an above normal weather demand year. Additionally, we occasionally experience various types of storms that damage our electric distribution infrastructure resulting in power outages. Our current year earnings were affected by several catastrophic wind and ice storms, as well as by the August blackout. Restoration and other costs associated with these power outages lowered 2003 earnings by an additional $31 million compared to 2002. Electric Customer Choice Program The electric Customer Choice program as originally structured in Michigan anticipated an eventual transition to a totally deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be charged market based rates for their electricity. However, Detroit Edisons rates continue to be regulated by the MPSC, while alternative suppliers can charge market based rates. This continued regulation has hindered Detroit Edisons ability to retain customers. Detroit Edisons results have been unfavorably impacted by the lack of recovery of lost margins and other costs associated with the electric Customer Choice program. Under Michigan legislation, we are allowed to recover net stranded costs associated with the electric Customer Choice program. To date, the MPSC has not fully implemented various provisions of Michigans restructuring legislation. Specifically, the MPSC: has not finalized all the components for calculating net stranded costs; has created a process whereby net stranded costs would be recovered two years after the costs were actually incurred; has not authorized timely recovery of any implementation costs associated with the electric Customer Choice program; and has created artificial incentives to encourage participation in the electric Customer Choice program In addition, the MPSC has maintained regulated rates for certain groups of customers that exceed the cost of service to those customers. This has resulted in high levels of participation in the electric Customer Choice program by those customers that have the highest price relative to their cost of service. As a result, we continue to lose sales each year and are seeing an accelerating pace of migration towards the end of 2003. Lost margins and electricity volumes associated with electric Customer Choice were 29 Table of Contents approximately $120 million and 7,281 gigawatthour (gWh) in 2003, compared with $50 million and 3,510 gWh in 2002. In February 2004, the MPSC authorized an interim base rate increase that recognized a revenue deficiency for lost Choice revenues, and eliminated transition credits and implemented a transition charge for Choice customers. The interim order is expected to reduce the level of Choice sales volumes. Assuming no further changes to the current electric Customer Choice program, we expect to continue losing margins and volumes in 2004. Partially offsetting the impact of lost margins in 2003, we recorded regulatory assets of $68 million representing an estimate of stranded costs that we believe are recoverable under Michigan legislation. Based on the MPSCs July 2003 order, we do not believe that any of the stranded costs in years prior to 2003 are recoverable. There are a number of variables and estimates that impact the level of recoverable stranded costs, including weather, sales mix and wholesale prices. As a result, our estimate of stranded costs could increase or decrease. The actual amount of stranded costs to be recovered will ultimately be determined by the MPSC. Detroit Edison addressed numerous issues with the electric Customer Choice program, including stranded costs, in its June 2003 rate filing and is also pursuing a legislative solution. Under the legislative solution, we are proposing to limit Customer Choice program participation to customers whose electric demand is 1 MW or greater. The continued delay in addressing the structural problems of the electric Customer Choice program and the timely and full recovery of stranded costs, unfavorably impacts earnings and cash flow. See Note 4 for a further discussion of the electric Customer Choice program and the MPSC interim rate order. Electric and Gas Rate Plans In 2000, Michigan legislation froze electric rates for all residential, commercial and industrial customers through 2003. The legislation also prevented rate increases or capped rates for residential customers through 2005, and for small commercial and industrial customers through 2004. The rate freeze and caps apply to base rates as well as rates designed to recover fuel and purchased power costs. Historically, these costs have been a pass through under the power supply cost recovery (PSCR) mechanism. In June 2003, Detroit Edison filed an application with the MPSC for: 1) an increase in retail electric rates of $427 million annually, 2) the resumption of the PSCR mechanism, and 3) the recovery of net stranded and other costs as permitted under Michigan legislation. Detroit Edison received an interim order in this rate case authorizing an increase in rates of $248 million annually. As a result of rate caps and other factors, the interim rate increase is only designed to increase revenues by $71 million in 2004 (Note 4). A final order is expected in the third quarter of 2004. The rate increase is effective for each customer class upon the expiration of the applicable rate cap period. The rate request is designed to more accurately reflect, among other things, significantly higher cost of service levels that Detroit Edison has experienced over the past few years. The recovery of net stranded costs, electric Customer Choice implementation costs and other costs incurred as a result of changes in taxes, laws and governmental actions are covered under Michigan legislation. However, the MPSC has not approved a final mechanism to recover such costs, and this has negatively affected our cash flow. As part of its rate filing, Detroit Edison has requested authorization to implement a 5 year surcharge to recover these costs. The MPSC deferred addressing this item until a final rate order is issued. In September 2003, MichCon filed an application with the MPSC for an increase in service and distribution charges for its gas sales and transportation customers totaling $194 million annually. The rate increase would be MichCons first since 1992, and is designed to recover significantly higher operating costs. MichCon expects an interim order in this case in mid 2004, with a final order by January 2005. Operating Costs During 2003, we experienced double digit increases in regulated operation and maintenance costs. The increases were driven by higher costs associated with pension and health care benefits, uncollectable accounts receivable and customer service initiatives. To address this issue of rising costs, we implemented several cost savings initiatives that partially offset these increases. Some of the initiatives were structural in nature, whereas others were temporary. Examples of these initiatives included a hiring freeze, a pause on discretionary spending and overtime restrictions. Additionally, we 30 Table of Contents reduced employee compensation costs, property and other taxes as well as interest costs through debt refinancings. Synthetic Fuel Operations We operate nine synthetic fuel production plants at eight locations. Interests in two of the nine plants were sold in 2002, interests in three other plants were sold in November 2003, and additional interests were sold in January 2004 in two of the plants sold in 2003. We continue to wholly own the remaining four plants, but intend to sell interests in all such plants in 2004. Synfuel facilities chemically change coal, including waste and marginal coal, into a synthetic fuel as determined under applicable IRS rules. Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code provides tax credits for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal. In addition to meeting various qualifying conditions, a taxpayer must have sufficient taxable income to earn the Section 29 credits. Our 2003 earnings were unfavorably affected by our inability to sell interests in synfuel plants until late 2003. The IRS suspended the issuance of private letter rulings (PLRs) relating to synthetic fuel projects in May 2003, pending its review of issues concerning chemical change, which is the basis for earning Section 29 tax credits. As a result of the IRS suspension, we were unable to complete the pending sale of interests in our synfuel projects. In addition, we experienced lower taxable earnings due to milder weather and continued cost and margin pressures. The temporary delay in selling interests in the synfuel projects, coupled with the lower taxable earnings, resulted in our capacity to generate more credits than we could utilize. These factors caused us to reduce our synthetic fuel production by approximately one half in June 2003 to optimize the tax credits generated from these facilities. We began implementing a series of initiatives, including the monetization of in the money gas swap derivative contracts, to improve cash flow and increase taxable income thereby allowing us to more fully utilize our Section 29 tax credits. In October 2003, the IRS concluded its assessment of the chemical change process involved in synfuel production and resumed issuing PLRs. The IRS determined that the test procedures and results used by taxpayers were scientifically valid if the procedures were applied in a consistent and unbiased manner. The conclusion of the IRS assessment allowed us to complete the sale of interests in additional facilities and increase synfuel production levels for the balance of 2003. Non regulated Growth During 2003, we continued to experience growth in our non regulated businesses with income reaching $199 million compared to $168 million in 2002. The significant improvement reflects increased contributions from our Energy Services segment due to higher synfuel production, partially offset by the impact of certain coke battery related Section 29 tax credits expiring in 2002. Additionally, non regulated growth in 2003 is attributable to increased margins in our Energy Marketing Trading segment. We also realized gains in 2003 from the sale of our 16% interest in the Portland Natural Gas Transmission System, an interstate pipeline company, and the settlement of a tolling contract at one of our merchant generating facilities. Although DTE Energys overall earnings were down 18% in 2003, our cash from operations totaling $950 million was comparable to the prior year despite a $222 million cash contribution to our pension plan. Operating cash flow reflects our successful initiative in 2003 to conserve cash, including better working capital management. This initiative coupled with $233 million in lower capital expenditures and over $750 million from selling non strategic and other assets, resulted in a lower debt to total capital ratio and a healthier balance sheet. Outlook We are facing many challenges in 2004 to maintain earnings and cash flow levels, while protecting a strong balance sheet. Our financial performance over the short term will be dependent on preserving healthy electric and gas utilities, monetizing our synthetic fuel projects and continuing to grow our non regulated businesses in a prudent manner. Remedying the structural issues of the electric Customer Choice program in Michigan is a key priority for the organization. These issues must be corrected to prevent the continued migration of customers to the Choice program based on false market signals. The potential implications to remaining customers over the longer term could be significantly higher electricity rates. 31 Table of Contents The timing and ultimate amount of final rate relief granted in the current electric and gas rate cases will affect customer service levels and our financial performance. Cash flow and earnings from our utilities will remain under pressure until the regulatory uncertainties are resolved. However, we remain focused on good cash management and a healthy balance sheet. We are aggressively pursuing the sales of interests in all of our remaining synthetic fuel projects in 2004. These sales, in addition to previously completed sales, are expected to provide a $200 million to $300 million boost to our cash flow in 2004. The availability of qualified buyers and the timing of these sales will impact this financial outcome. In addition, we are continuing to grow our non regulated businesses in areas such as waste coal technologies, coal bed methane production and on site energy project development. Due to the regulatory uncertainties over the short term, we remain disciplined and conservative in our pursuit of incremental growth investments. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We had income of $521 million in 2003, or $3.09 per diluted share, compared to income of $632 million, or $3.83 per diluted share in 2002 and income of $332 million, or $2.16 per diluted share in 2001. The comparability of earnings was impacted by the sale of our transmission business, International Transmission Company (ITC), and the adoption of new accounting rules as subsequently discussed. Upon selling ITC in February 2003, we classified this business as a discontinued operation. Excluding discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes, our earnings from continuing operations in 2003 were $480 million, or $2.85 per diluted share, compared to earnings of $586 million, or $3.55 per diluted share in 2002 and earnings of $309 million, or $2.01 per diluted share in 2001. The following sections provide a detailed discussion of our segments, operating performance and future outlook. Segment Performance Outlook We operate our businesses through three strategic business units (Energy Resources, Energy Distribution and Energy Gas). Each business unit has regulated and non regulated operations. The balance of our business consists of Corporate Other. Based on this structure, we set strategic goals, allocate resources and evaluate performance. This results in the following reportable segments. 32 Table of Contents (in Millions, except per share data) 2003 2002 2001 Net Income (Loss) Energy Resources Regulated Power Generation $ 235 $ 241 $ 139 Non regulated Energy Services 199 182 115 Energy Marketing Trading 45 25 44 Other (2 ) 7 6 Total Non regulated 242 214 165 477 455 304 Energy Distribution Regulated Power Distribution 17 111 97 Non regulated (15 ) (16 ) (10 ) 2 95 87 Energy Gas Regulated Gas Distribution 29 66 (38 ) Non regulated 29 26 11 58 92 (27 ) Corporate Other (57 ) (56 ) (55 ) Income from Continuing Operations Regulated 281 418 198 Non regulated (1) 199 168 111 480 586 309 Discontinued Operations 68 46 20 Cumulative Effect of Accounting Changes (27 ) 3 Net Income $ 521 $ 632 $ 332 Diluted Earnings Per Share Regulated $ 1.67 $ 2.53 $ 1.29 Non regulated (1) 1.18 1.02 .72 Income from Continuing Operations 2.85 3.55 2.01 Discontinued Operations .40 .28 .13 Cumulative Effect of Accounting Changes (.16 ) .02 Net Income $ 3.09 $ 3.83 $ 2.16 (1) Includes Corporate Other. 33 Table of Contents ENERGY RESOURCES Power Generation The power generation plants of Detroit Edison comprise our regulated power generation business. Detroit Edisons numerous fossil plants, its hydroelectric pumped storage plant and its nuclear plant generate electricity. The generated electricity, supplemented with purchased power, is sold principally throughout Michigan and the Midwest to residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale customers. (in Millions) 2003 2002 2001 Operating Revenues $ 2,448 $ 2,711 $ 2,788 Fuel and Purchased Power (920 ) (1,048 ) (1,231 ) Gross Margin 1,528 1,663 1,557 Operation and Maintenance (628 ) (626 ) (571 ) Depreciation and Amortization (224 ) (331 ) (385 ) Taxes Other Than Income (157 ) (156 ) (148 ) Merger and Restructuring Charges (Note 3) (72 ) Operating Income 519 550 381 Other Income and (Deductions) (149 ) (189 ) (184 ) Income Tax Provision (135 ) (120 ) (58 ) Net Income $ 235 $ 241 $ 139 Operating Income as a Percent of Operating Revenues 21 % 20 % 14 % Factors impacting income: Power Generation earnings decreased $6 million in 2003 and increased $102 million in 2002, compared to the prior year. As subsequently discussed, these results primarily reflect changes in gross margins, increased operation and maintenance expenses and the recording of higher regulatory deferrals, which lowered depreciation and amortization expenses. Merger and restructuring charges associated with the 2001 MCN Energy acquisition also impacted the comparability of results. These charges represent costs associated with systems integration, relocation, legal, accounting and consulting services, as well as costs associated with a work force reduction plan. The plan included early retirement incentives and voluntary separation agreements for employees in overlapping corporate support areas. Gross margins in 2003 declined $135 million due primarily to decreased cooling demand resulting from mild summer weather, lost margins from customers choosing to purchase power from alternative suppliers under the electric Customer Choice program and lost margins from the August 2003 blackout. Weather in 2003 was 38% milder than 2002 resulting in lost margins of $114 million. Detroit Edison lost 16% of retail sales in 2003 and 6% of such sales in 2002 as a result of customers choosing to purchase power from alternative suppliers under the electric Customer Choice program. We estimate that we lost $120 million of margins in 2003 under the electric Customer Choice program, an increase of $70 million over 2002. Lost Choice margins that we believe are recoverable under Michigan legislation are recorded as regulatory assets and therefore reduced depreciation and amortization expense as subsequently discussed. Gross margins benefited from a $.64 per MWh (4%) decline in fuel and purchased power costs reflecting the use of a more favorable power supply mix. The favorable mix is due to lower purchases, which is driven by lost sales under the electric Customer Choice program. Gross margins in 2002 improved $106 million due primarily to significantly lower fuel and purchased power costs, partially offset by reduced operating revenues. The reduction in fuel and purchased power costs was driven by a $39.08 per MWh (50%) reduction in average purchased power prices from 2001 levels. The decline in operating revenues is attributable to commercial, industrial and wholesale customers. Commercial and industrial revenues were lower due to a full years impact of a 5% legislatively mandated rate reduction for customers that began in April 2001. Additionally, revenues from these retail customers were affected by customers switching to alternative suppliers under the electric Customer Choice program. Revenues from wholesale customers were reduced, reflecting lower power prices. Partially offsetting these revenue reductions was the impact of weather, resulting in a 10% increase in cooling demand during 2002. 34 Table of Contents (in Thousands of MWh) 2003 2002 2001 Power Generated and Purchased Power Plant Generation Fossil Coal 37,408 71 % 37,381 64 % 38,424 69 % Natural Gas Other 644 1 1,636 3 1,287 2 Nuclear (Fermi 2) 8,114 16 9,301 16 8,555 16 46,166 88 48,318 83 48,266 87 Purchased Power 6,354 12 9,807 17 7,482 13 System Output 52,520 100 % 58,125 100 % 55,748 100 % Average Unit Cost ($/MWh) Generation (1) $ 12.89 $ 12.53 $ 12.31 Purchased Power (2) $ 41.73 $ 39.16 $ 78.24 Overall Average Unit Cost $ 16.38 $ 17.02 $ 21.15 (1) Represents fuel costs associated with power plants. (2) Includes amounts associated with hedging activities. Operation and maintenance expense increased $2 million in 2003 and $55 million in 2002. Operation and maintenance expenses in 2003 were affected by $5 million in costs associated with the August 2003 blackout (Note 4) and a $69 million increase in employee pension and health care benefit costs, due to recent financial market performance, lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates. Partially offsetting these increases were benefits from the DTE Operating System, our company wide initiative to pursue cost efficiencies as well as enhance operating performance. The DTE Operating System involves the application of tools and operating practices, which have resulted in inventory reductions and improvements in technology systems, among other enhancements. Operation and maintenance expenses in 2003 also benefited from $23 million in sales of emissions credits and lower employee incentive costs. Operation and maintenance expenses in 2002 reflect $18 million in higher employee pension and health care benefit costs and $43 million in expenses associated with maintaining our generation fleet. The 2002 increase also includes a $5 million increase in allocations for corporate support services, as well as $11 million to fund the low income and energy efficiency fund. The funding of the low income and energy efficiency program was required under Michigan legislation and is recovered in current sales rates. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $107 million in 2003 and $54 million in 2002. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is attributable to the income effect of recording regulatory assets totaling $126 million in 2003 and $41 million in 2002 representing the deferral of net stranded and other costs we believe are recoverable under Public Act 141. The decline in 2002 also reflects the extension of the amortization period from seven years to 14 years for certain regulatory assets that were securitized in 2001. See Note 4 Regulatory Matters. Partially offsetting these declines was increased depreciation associated with generation related capital expenditures. Other income and deductions declined $40 million in 2003 and increased $5 million in 2002. The reduction in 2003 is attributable to lower interest expense and increased interest income. Interest expense reflects lower borrowing levels and rates, and interest income includes the accrual of carrying charges on environmental related regulatory assets. Outlook Future operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as regulatory proceedings, new legislation, changes in market prices of power, changes in economic conditions and the levels of customer participation in the electric Customer Choice program. As previously discussed, we expect to continue losing retail sales and margins in future years under the electric Customer Choice program until the inequities associated with this program are addressed. We will accrue as regulatory assets our unrecovered generation related fixed costs due to electric Customer Choice that we believe are recoverable under Michigan legislation. We have addressed the issue of stranded costs in our June 2003 electric rate filing and are also pursuing a legislative solution. Additionally, we requested an increase in retail electric rates of $427 million annually to recover higher operating costs and the resumption of the PSCR mechanism. In February 2004, the MPSC authorized an interim base rate increase of $248 million annually. The actual timing and level of recovering stranded and operating costs will ultimately be determined by the MPSC or legislation. We cannot predict the outcome of these matters. See Note 4 Regulatory Matters. 35 Table of Contents Energy Services Energy Services is comprised of Coal Based Fuels, On Site Energy Projects and Merchant Generation. Coal Based Fuels operations include producing synthetic fuel from nine synfuel plants and producing coke from three coke battery plants. Both processes generate tax credits under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. On Site Energy Projects include pulverized coal injection, power generation, steam production, chilled water production, wastewater treatment and compressed air supply. Merchant Generation owns and operates four gas fired peaking electric generating plants and develops and acquires gas and coal fired generation.

As subsequently discussed, these results primarily reflect increases in synfuel production, varying levels of Section 29 tax credits, a one time contract gain and a write off of an uncollectable account. Operating revenues increased $284 million in 2003 and $198 million in 2002 reflecting higher synfuel production due to a greater number of operating synfuel plants. All nine of our synfuel plants were operational throughout 2003, whereas only five were operational throughout 2002 and only two in 2001. As discussed in Note 13, the growth in synfuel revenues was tempered by our decision to reduce synfuel production by approximately one half in June 2003. Also impacting the 2003 comparison was reduced generation revenue due to the settlement of a tolling contract at one of our generating facilities. (Dollars in Millions) 2003 2002 2001 Coal Based Fuels Statistics Synfuel Plants: Operational at End of Year 9 9 5 Tax Credits Generated (1) $ 227.7 $ 180.2 $ 64.1 Coke Battery Plants: Operational at End of Year 3 3 3 Tax Credits Generated (1) $ 2.5 $ 57.4 $ 88.6 (1) DTE Energys portion of total tax credits generated 36 Table of Contents Operation and maintenance expense increased $258 million in 2003 and $308 million in 2002, reflecting costs associated with the higher levels of synfuel production. Operating expenses associated with synfuel projects exceed operating revenues and therefore generate operating losses, which are more than offset by the resulting Section 29 tax credits. Operation and maintenance expense in 2003 also includes a $10 million net of tax write off for an uncollectable receivable associated with a large customer bankruptcy. Partially offsetting these increases was a one time $19 million net of tax gain from the settlement of the tolling contract. Other income and deductions increased $16 million in 2003 and $87 million in 2002. The increases reflect our minority partners share of operating losses associated with synfuel operations. The sale of interests in our synfuel facilities during 2002 and 2003 resulted in our minority partners being allocated a larger percentage of such losses. Income tax benefits decreased $19 million in 2003 and increased $95 million in 2002. Income tax variations reflect changes in taxable earnings and the level of Section 29 tax credits from our synfuel and coke battery facilities. Tax credits from our synfuel operations increased in each of the last two years due to higher synfuel production. Tax credits from our coke battery production reflect the expiration of such credits at two of our three plants in 2002. Additionally, tax credits were impacted by our interest in one of the coke battery projects being reduced from 95% to 5% in 2002, consistent with the original purchase and sale agreement. Outlook A significant portion of Energy Services earnings consist of Section 29 tax credits. Synfuel related tax credits expire in 2007. Tax credits for two of our three coke batteries expired at the end of 2002, and the third expires in 2007. We are aggressively pursuing opportunities to sell interests in all of our synfuel plants in 2004. The level of tax credits generated in future periods will be affected by the timing and number of synfuel projects sold. When we sell an interest in a synfuel facility, we recognize the gain from such sale under the installment method of accounting. Gain recognition is dependent on the synfuel production qualifying for Section 29 tax credits. In substance, we are receiving installment gains and reduced operating losses in exchange for tax credits. Sales of interests in synfuel projects allow us to accelerate cash flow while maintaining a stable income base. There is a bill currently before the United States Congress that includes provisions extending or reinstating tax credits for various types of energy facilities and processes, including coke batteries, Antrim shale gas, coal bed methane, refined coal and landfill gas. We are unable to predict the outcome of the legislative process. Energy Services will continue leveraging its extensive energy related operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow the on site energy business. We continue to explore growth opportunities that will not require significant initial capital investment. We are currently negotiating an on site energy business arrangement with a major manufacturer in the Midwest. Power prices over the past few years have been low due, in part, to the current excess capacity in the generation industry. Additionally, the generation tolling agreement that was settled in 2003 was at above market rates. As a result of these factors, we expect lower revenues and earnings from our merchant generation business in 2004. Energy Marketing Trading Energy Marketing Trading consists of the electric and gas marketing and trading operations of DTE Energy Trading and CoEnergy. DTE Energy Trading focuses on physical power marketing and 37 Table of Contents structured transactions, as well as the enhancement of returns from DTE Energys power plants. CoEnergy focuses on physical gas marketing and the optimization of DTE Energys owned and contracted natural gas pipelines and gas storage capacity. To this end, both companies enter into derivative financial instruments as part of their strategies, including forwards, futures, swaps and option contracts. The derivative financial instruments are accounted for under the mark to market method, which results in earnings recognition of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives. Factors impacting income: Energy Marketing Tradings earnings increased $20 million in 2003, of which $18 million was attributable to DTE Energy Trading and $2 million to CoEnergy. Earnings for 2002 decreased $19 million, consisting of a $6 million improvement at DTE Energy Trading, which was more than offset by a $25 million reduction at CoEnergy. DTE Energy Tradings earnings improvement in 2003 and 2002 was due mainly to margins associated with short term physical trading and origination activities. The improvement was partially offset by reduced proprietary trading profits. Proprietary trading represents derivative activity transacted with the intent of capturing profits on forward price movements.

See Fair Value of Contracts section that follows. 3) Unrealized gas in inventory margins represent gains and losses associated with fair value accounting in 2002 and 2001. CoEnergy changed its method of accounting for inventory in January 2003 (Note 2). CoEnergys earnings in 2003 and 2002 were driven by varying levels of operating costs and margins. Operating costs reflect the scale back of certain retail gas marketing operations in 2002 as well as lower allocations for corporate support services in 2003. Variations in margins reflect: 1) the settling or monetizing of certain in the money derivative contracts in 2003, 2) a change in the method of accounting for our gas in inventory in January 2003, and 3) volatility related to the accounting for our production related gas supply contracts in 2001. We monetized certain in the money derivative contracts in 2003 while simultaneously entering into replacement at the market contracts with various counterparties. The monetizations were completed in conjunction with implementing a series of initiatives to improve cash flow as well as our ability to fully 38 Table of Contents utilize Section 29 tax credits (Note 13). The monetizations had the impact of reducing unrealized gains and increasing realized gains by approximately $136 million, with no significant impact on earnings. As previously discussed, our derivative financial instruments are accounted for under the mark to market method, including those derivatives that hedge our price risk exposure associated with gas in inventory. Through December 2002, our physical gas in inventory was marked to the current spot price under fair value accounting rules. Accordingly, mark to market accounting for derivatives, coupled with fair value accounting for gas in inventory, minimized earnings mismatches. To comply with new accounting requirements resulting from the rescission of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities, we changed to the average cost method for our gas inventories, effective January 2003 (Note 2). As a result, CoEnergy experienced earnings volatility as it recorded unrealized gains in 2002 and unrealized losses in 2001 from fair valuing its inventory, whereas no such gains or losses were recorded in 2003. The comparability of CoEnergys results was also affected by using different market prices for fair valuing its derivatives and fair valuing its gas in inventory, before the accounting change. Derivatives are marked to market against the forward curve, whereas gas in inventory was marked to the current spot price. The difference in accounting for derivatives and gas in storage resulted in earnings volatility in 2002 and 2001 when price changes in the spot month did not correspond with those in the forward market. Gas in storage in December 2002 was priced at a spot market rate of $5.10 Mcf, compared to $2.77 per Mcf in December 2001 and a May 31, 2001, acquisition date rate of $4.10 per Mcf. Significantly smaller changes in forward prices occurred during these same periods. As a result, the mark to market gains and losses on gas inventory were only partially offset by mark to market losses and gains on the storage related derivatives. CoEnergy receives gas produced from DTE Energys Gas Production operations, which is used to meet its commitments under long term contracts with cogeneration customers. The gas produced does not qualify for mark to market accounting. CoEnergy recorded a gain in 2001 totaling approximately $50 million, net of taxes, primarily attributable to marking to market sales contracts with power generation customers without recording an offsetting loss from marking to market the production related gas supply. In December 2001, CoEnergy entered into hedge transactions that substantially mitigate the earnings volatility related to the gas contracts with power generation customers. Outlook Energy Marketing Trading will seek to manage its business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments. Gas storage and transportation capacity enhances our ability to provide reliable and custom tailored bundled services to large volume end users and utilities. This capacity, coupled with the synergies from DTE Energys other businesses, positions the segment to add value. Significant portions of the Energy Marketing Trading portfolio are economically hedged, and include financial instruments, gas inventory, as well as owned and contracted natural gas pipelines and storage assets. These financial instruments are deemed derivatives whereas the gas inventory, pipelines and storage assets are not considered derivatives for accounting purposes. As a result, Energy Marketing Trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to market without revaluing the underlying non derivative contracts and assets. A significant portion of the earnings volatility in this segment is associated with the natural gas storage cycle, which runs from June to March. Injections of gas into inventory takes place in the summer and gas is withdrawn in the winter. DTE Energys policy is to hedge the price risk of all purchases for storage with sales in the over the counter and futures markets, eliminating the price risk for the storage business. As previously discussed, current accounting rules do allow for the marking to market of forward sales, but do not allow for the marking to market of the related gas inventory. This results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim periods, but even out by the end of the storage cycle. 39 Table of Contents In February 2004, we terminated a long term gas exchange agreement and modified our future purchase commitments under a related transportation agreement with an interstate pipeline company, effective March 31, 2004. The agreements were at rates that were not reflective of current market conditions and had been fair valued under generally accepted accounting principles. In 2002, the fair value of the transportation agreement was frozen when it no longer met the definition of a derivative as a result of FERC Order 637. The fair value amounts were being amortized to income over the life of the related agreements, representing a net liability of approximately $75 million as of December 31, 2003. We are currently negotiating new agreements with the interstate pipeline company. We will record an appropriate adjustment to the liability after all related agreements have been finalized. Non regulated Other Our other non regulated businesses are comprised of our Coal Services and Biomass units. Coal Services provides fuel, transportation and equipment management services. We specialize in minimizing energy production costs and maximizing reliability of supply for energy intensive customers. Additionally, we participate in coal trading and coal to power tolling transactions, as well as sales of excess emissions credits. Coal Services has formed a subsidiary, DTE PepTec Inc., that uses proprietary technology to produce high quality coal products from fine coal slurries that are typically discarded from coal mining operations. Biomass develops, owns and operates landfill recovery systems in the U.S. Gas produced from these landfill sites qualifies for Section 29 tax credits. Factors impacting income: Earnings declined $9 million in 2003 and increased $1 million in 2002. The 2003 decline reflects reduced marketing and tolling income as well as an increase in operating costs associated with ramping up the DTE PepTec business. Our first waste coal facility in Ohio became operational in late 2003. (Dollars in Millions) 2003 2002 2001 Coal Services Tons of coal shipped (in millions) 32.0 28.5 23.5 Biomass Gas Produced (in Bcf) 26.8 27.5 24.2 Tax Credits Generated (1) $ 10.5 $ 12.9 $ 11.9 (1) DTE Energys portion of total tax credits generated Outlook We expect to continue to grow our Coal Services and Biomass units. We believe a substantial market exists for the use of DTE PepTec Inc. technology and plan to aggressively pursue expansion opportunities. We expect to open 3 to 5 operating sites in 2004. Biomass currently has 31 operating sites and other projects under development. Section 29 tax credits related to Biomass operations expire in 2007. ENERGY DISTRIBUTION Power Distribution Power Distribution operations include the electric distribution services of Detroit Edison. Power Distribution distributes electricity generated and purchased by Energy Resources and alternative electric suppliers to Detroit Edisons 2.1 million customers. 40 Table of Contents (in Millions) 2003 2002 2001 Operating Revenues $ 1,247 $ 1,343 $ 1,256 Fuel and Purchased Power (19 ) (26 ) (10 ) Operation and Maintenance (724 ) (649 ) (511 ) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (249 ) (246 ) (246 ) Taxes Other Than Income (100 ) (117 ) (120 ) Merger and Restructuring Charges (114 ) Operating Income 155 305 255 Other Income and (Deductions) (128 ) (136 ) (132 ) Income Tax Provision (10 ) (58 ) (26 ) Net Income $ 17 $ 111 $ 97 Operating Income as a Percent of Operating Revenues 12 % 23 % 20 % Factors impacting income: Power Distribution earnings decreased $94 million during 2003 and increased $14 million in 2002, compared to the prior year. As subsequently discussed, these results primarily reflect changes in operating revenues and increased operation and maintenance expenses. Merger and restructuring charges associated with the 2001 MCN Energy acquisition also impacted the comparability of results. Operating revenues declined $96 million in 2003 primarily due to mild summer weather and the impact of slower economic conditions affecting commercial and industrial sales. Operating revenues increased $87 million in 2002 reflecting higher residential sales attributable to greater cooling demand. Below are volumes associated with the regulated power distribution business: (in Thousands of MWh) 2003 2002 2001 Electric Deliveries Residential 15,074 15,958 14,503 Commercial 15,942 18,395 18,777 Industrial 12,254 13,590 14,430 Wholesale 2,241 2,249 2,159 45,511 50,192 49,869 Electric Choice 7,281 3,510 1,268 Total Electric Deliveries 52,792 53,702 51,137 Operation and maintenance expense increased $75 million in 2003 and $138 million in 2002 reflecting higher costs associated with weather related power outages, employee benefits, uncollectable accounts receivables, allocations for corporate support services, and customer service initiatives to improve customer satisfaction. Restoration costs associated with three catastrophic storms in 2003 and the August 2003 blackout totaled $76 million. We experienced an April ice storm, resulting in more than 400,000 customers losing power, a July windstorm, affecting over 190,000 customers, a November windstorm, affecting 160,000 customers, and the August blackout, affecting all 2.1 million of our customers. This compares with $49 million in costs in 2002 related to two catastrophic storms, as well as heat related maintenance expenses due to prolonged periods of above normal summer temperatures and the related stress placed on our distribution system. Employee pension and health care benefit costs increased $26 million in 2003 and $12 million in 2002 due to recent financial market performance, lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates. Uncollectable accounts expense increased $17 million in 2003 and decreased $1 million in 2002 reflecting higher past due amounts attributable to current economic conditions. Additionally, results for 41 Table of Contents 2003 also reflect costs associated with customer service initiatives and a net of tax loss of $14 million on the sale of our non strategic steam heating business (Note 3). Partially offsetting these increases were benefits from the DTE Operating System, as previously discussed, and lower employee incentive costs. Taxes other than income decreased $17 million in 2003 and $3 million in 2002. The decline in 2003 is due to lower Michigan Single Business Taxes, reflecting reduced taxable earnings, and lower property taxes. Outlook Operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as weather, changes in economic conditions and the severity and frequency of storms. Economic conditions and prior billing issues have resulted in an increase in past due receivables. We believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates. However, failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables would unfavorably affect operating results. As a result, we have organized a focused effort to address the credit and collection issues. We experienced numerous catastrophic storms over the past few years. The effect of the storms on annual earnings ranged up to $70 million and was partially offset by storm insurance. We were unable to obtain storm insurance at economical rates in 2004 and as a result, we do not anticipate having insurance coverage at levels that would significantly offset unplanned expenses from ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds that damage our distribution infrastructure. As previously mentioned, Detroit Edison filed a rate case in June 2003 to address future operating costs and other issues. Detroit Edison received an interim order in this rate case in February 2004. See Note 4 Regulatory Matters. Non Regulated Non regulated Energy Distribution operations consist of DTE Energy Technologies which markets and distributes distributed generation products, provides application engineering, and monitors and manages generation system operations. Factors impacting income: Non regulated losses decreased $1 million in 2003 and increased $6 million in 2002. The slight improvement in 2003 is due primarily to increased sales and cost reductions. Outlook Although installed capacity for DTE Energy Technologies is increasing, the growth in this business is below our expectations. Accordingly, we have taken actions to reduce our expenses and streamline our operations, including exiting from some non strategic business lines and activities. DTE Energy Technologies expects to continue participating in the emerging distributed generation market. 42 Table of Contents ENERGY GAS Gas Distribution Gas Distribution operations include gas distribution services primarily provided by MichCon, our gas utility that purchases, stores, distributes and sells natural gas to 1.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers located throughout Michigan.

As subsequently discussed, results in 2003 primarily reflect a decline in gross margins and increased operation and maintenance expenses. The significant improvement in 2002 reflects a full year of operations of MichCon, which was acquired in conjunction with the MCN Energy merger in May 2001. In contrast to 2001, the 2002 results include the January through April period when demand for natural gas is at its highest. Merger and restructuring charges associated with the merger also impacted the comparability. The pro forma impact of the MCN Energy acquisition on DTE Energy is discussed in Note 3 Acquisitions and Dispositions. Gross margins declined $6 million in 2003 reflecting a $26.5 million reserve for the potential disallowance in gas costs pursuant to a March 2003 MPSC order in MichCons 2002 GCR plan case (Note 4). The impact of the reserve was significantly offset by increased sales due to colder winter weather in early 2003. Operation and maintenance expense increased $74 million in 2003 reflecting higher costs associated with employee benefits, uncollectable accounts receivables, allocations for corporate support services, and customer service initiatives. Employee pension and health care benefit costs increased $47 million in 2003 and uncollectable accounts expense increased $17 million in 2003 reflecting economic conditions and higher gas prices. Partially offsetting these increases were benefits from the DTE Operating System, as previously discussed, and lower employee incentive costs. Income taxes in 2003 were impacted by lower earnings and favorably affected by an increase in the amortization of tax benefits previously deferred in accordance with MPSC regulations. Outlook Operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as regulatory proceedings, weather and changes in economic conditions. Higher gas prices, current economic conditions and prior billing issues have resulted in an increase in past due receivables. We believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates. However, failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables would unfavorably affect operating results. As previously discussed, we are focused on addressing the credit and collection issues. The MPSC issued several orders that continue the gas Customer Choice program on a permanent basis. Since MichCon continues to transport and deliver the gas to the participating customer premises at prices comparable to margins earned on gas sales, customers switching to other suppliers have little impact on MichCons earnings. As of December 2003, approximately 129,000 customers were participating in the gas Customer Choice program, compared with approximately 190,000 customers as of December 2002. As a result of the continued increase in operating costs, MichCon filed a rate case in September 2003 to increase rates by $194 million annually to address future operating costs and other issues. See Note 4 Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents Non regulated Non regulated operations include the Gas Production business and the Gas Storage, Pipelines Processing business. Our Gas Production business produces gas from proven reserves in northern Michigan and sells the gas to the Energy Marketing Trading segment. Gas Storage, Pipelines Processing has a partnership interest in an interstate transmission pipeline, seven carbon dioxide processing facilities and a natural gas storage field, as well as lease rights to another natural gas storage field. The assets of these businesses are well integrated with other DTE Energy entities. Factors impacting income: Earnings increased $3 million in 2003 and $15 million in 2002. The 2003 earnings improvement primarily reflects the gain from the sale of our 16% pipeline interest in the Portland Natural Gas Transmission System. The 2002 results reflect a full year of operations of the our non regulated gas businesses that were acquired in conjunction with the MCN Energy acquisition in May 2001. Outlook We expect to further develop our gas production properties in northern Michigan and our pipelines, processing and storage assets to support other DTE Energy businesses. In October 2003, we acquired an additional 15% interest in the Vector Pipeline, bringing our total ownership interest to 40%. The purchase of the additional interest in the Vector Pipeline complements our existing gas distribution and storage facilities in Michigan. Additionally, we expect to continue to invest in opportunities in the coal bed methane business to leverage our production, coal and low cost operating capabilities. CORPORATE OTHER Corporate Other includes the administrative and general expenses of various corporate support functions such as accounting, legal and information technology. As these functions essentially support the entire company, they are allocated to the various segments based on services utilized and therefore can vary from year to year. Additionally, Corporate Other holds certain non regulated debt and investments, including assets held for sale and in emerging energy technologies. Factors impacting income: Corporate Others losses were basically flat in 2003 and 2002. The 2003 results were affected by a $15 million cash contribution to the DTE Energy Foundation that was funded with proceeds received from the sale of ITC (Note 3). The impact of the contribution was offset by lower interest costs. Results in 2002 reflect higher interest expense resulting from increased debt and a full years impact of corporate debt assumed in the MCN Energy acquisition. Additionally, 2002 results reflect a reserve of $11 million (pre tax) for the possible loss associated with direct loans to and the guarantee of debt of a technology investment. Losses in 2001 include the amortization of goodwill associated with the MCN Energy acquisition. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ITC In December 2002, we entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Co. and Trimaran Capital Partners, LLC to sell ITC for $610 million in cash. The sale closed on February 28, 2003 following approval of the transaction by the FERC and resolution of all other contingencies and generated a net of tax gain of $63 million. Prior to May 31, 2001, Detroit Edison owned and operated the transmission assets of ITC, which were vertically integrated with its other operations. Accordingly, revenues, expenses and cash flows associated with these transmission assets were bundled with Detroit Edisons Power Distribution operations. Significant changes in regulation over the past few years required Detroit Edison to cede operating control of its transmission assets to an independent system operator or to sell its transmission assets. In response to these new requirements we formed ITC and transferred our transmission assets to this wholly owned subsidiary with the intent of divesting ITC. Effective June 1, 2001, the transmission assets of ITC were transferred to DTE Corporate and its revenues, expenses and cash flows were separately monitored to measure its financial and operating performance. Accordingly, the presentation of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations reflects the results of ITC after May 31, 2001. The 44 Table of Contents financial results of the transmission business prior to June 1, 2001 are included as part of the Power Distribution segment. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES As required by generally accepted accounting principles, on January 1, 2003, we adopted new accounting rules for asset retirement obligations and energy trading activities. The cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting rules reduced 2003 earnings by $27 million. Additionally, on January 1, 2001 we adopted a new accounting rule for derivative instruments and the cumulative effect of adopting this new rule increased 2001 earnings by $3 million. See Note 2 for further discussion.

In addition, we use cash from operations to retire long term debt and pay dividends. A majority of the companys operating cash flow is provided by the two regulated utilities, which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather, customer choice sales loss, regulatory outcomes, economic conditions and operating costs. This part of our business has recently been under considerable financial pressure given that we have not had a rate increase in over 10 years, coupled with higher operating costs and increased regulatory deferrals. While these regulatory deferrals at Detroit Edison have served to mitigate some of the earnings pressures as a result of these influencing factors, the corresponding cash flows have been deferred. Our non regulated businesses also provide sources of cash flow to the enterprise and reflect a range of operating profiles. These vary from our synthetic fuels business, which will provide substantial cash flow over the next 5 years, to new start ups, such as our coal bed methane or waste coal recovery businesses, which are growing and will require modest investments beyond their cash generation capabilities. During 2003, our consolidated net cash from operating activities was $950 million, reflecting a decrease of $46 million from 2002 levels. The decrease in 2003 operating cash flow was attributable to declines in regulated net income, after adjusting for noncash items (depreciation, depletion, amortization, deferred taxes and gains), reflecting the impacts of weather, lost electric Customer Choice margins and higher operating costs. Partially offsetting these declines were lower working capital and other requirements reflecting a company wide initiative focused on improving cash flow. The initiative included better inventory management, improved accounts receivable collections, the selling of interests in our synfuel facilities, the monetization of in the money derivatives and replacing margin deposits with letters of credit. The improvement in working capital was achieved despite a $222 million contribution to our pension plan. Operating cash flow in 2002 of $996 million was $185 million higher than 2001 levels, largely attributable to the full years impact of the MCN Energy acquisition, which was completed in May 2001. Lower working capital and other requirements were partially offset by a decline in net income, after adjusting for noncash items. Working capital reflects the seasonal requirements of the gas business where cash is used in the second half of the year to finance increases in gas inventories and customer accounts receivable. Additionally, past due accounts receivable balances increased due to higher gas prices, economic conditions and conversion issues with the new combined utility billing system. Outlook We expect cash flow from operations to increase over the long term, but to remain relatively the same in 2004 as 2003. Cash flow improvements from utility rate increases and synfuel sales will be offset by higher cash requirements primarily within our energy marketing and trading business. Operating cash flow from our utilities is expected to increase in 2004, but will be affected by the level of sales migration under the electric Customer Choice program and the ability of the MPSC within the regulatory processes to put in place a Choice program that has sound economic fundamentals. In addition, the Choice programs impact will also be determined by the success of the company in addressing certain structural flaws within the legislative process. While the Choice programs shortfalls may be structurally addressed within these two processes, the use of regulatory deferrals by the MPSC might affect the cash benefits of addressing the existing choice program being realized in 2004. Another factor affecting regulated cash flows is the degree and timing of rate relief within the electric and gas rate cases. Based on the interim order issued by the MPSC on February 20, 2004, approximately $71 million of additional revenues should be realized within the 2004 calendar year. Due to the structure of the interim rate order, we will not realize the full benefits of interim and final rate relief until 2006 when customer rate caps expire. Improvements in cash flow from our utilities are also expected from better managing our working capital requirements, including the continued focus of reducing past due accounts receivables. Our emphasis in these businesses will continue to be centered around cash generation and conservation given the regulatory uncertainties. Cash flow from our synfuel business, including proceeds from the sale of interests in related facilities, should shift from a net cash loss of $195 million in 2003 to positive cash flow of $135 million in 2004 and $355 million in 2005. The expected improvements are driven by the sale of interests in synfuel facilities, increased production and a higher cash value per credit. We will also benefit from lower taxes paid as we use our tax credit carry forward position. Our other operating non regulated businesses will provide minimal cash from operations in 2004 and grow modestly in future years. Remaining start up businesses such as coal bed methane, waste coal recovery and distributed generation will have cash losses over the next couple of years while they are being further developed. Certain of the cash initiatives previously discussed, resulted in accelerating the receipt of cash in 2003 which will have the impact of lowering cash flow in 2004. 46 Table of Contents Investing Activities Cash inflows associated with investing activities are partially generated from the sale of assets and utilized to invest in our utilities and non regulated businesses. In any given year, we will look to harvest cash from under performing or non strategic assets. Capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain our generation and distribution infrastructure and comply with environmental regulations. We have incurred higher utility capital expenditures over the past several years to comply with new air quality standards. Capital spending within our non regulated businesses should be viewed in two categories. For businesses currently operating, expenditures are for ongoing maintenance and some expansion. The balance of non regulated spending is for growth, which we manage very carefully. We look to make investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy, management skills, risks and returns. All new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis. We have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria. For new business lines, we invest tentatively based on research and analysis. Based on a limited investment, we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results. In any given year, the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings. During 2003, we had net cash from investing activities of $10 million compared to cash used of $1.1 billion in 2002. The significant improvement was due to proceeds totaling $758 million from the sale of ITC, interests in three synfuel projects and non strategic assets that were acquired as part of the MCN Energy acquisition. Additionally, regulated and non regulated plant expenditures decreased significantly in 2003. Lower regulated expenditures of $115 million were associated with air quality regulations that require reductions in nitrogen oxide levels. Non regulated expenditures declined by $118 million and the comparison reflects costs incurred in 2002 associated with four synfuel facilities that became fully operational. During 2002, the investing activity cash flow comparison improved by $1.2 billion and was impacted by the cash portion of the MCN Energy acquisition in 2001. The 2002 improvement was also due to lower non regulated capital expenditures, partially offset by reduced proceeds from the sale of assets. Outlook Our strategic direction anticipates base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in 2004 ranging from $750 million to $1.0 billion. Our utilities plan to spend higher amounts of capital, but actual spending levels will be matched to available cash flows. Until our two rate cases are resolved, we will hold utility capital spending at 2003 levels. Capital spending for general corporate purposes will increase in 2004 primarily as a result of our DTE2 initiative, as subsequently discussed. This project will require capital investments in 2004 and 2005 for new computer systems. Non regulated capital spending will approximate $80 million to $100 million annually for the next several years. Capital spending for growth of existing or new businesses will be constrained in 2004 due to the pending rate cases, electric Customer Choice issues and rating agency concerns about these businesses. Accordingly, we are seeking to grow the business by making small investments in areas like coal bed methane and waste coal recovery. Utilizing this approach allows us to determine quarterly our spending levels, which will be based on capital and credit constraints. Longer term, once the electric Choice issues are resolved and utility rate increases are fully phased in, we anticipate capital availability to return to historical levels. After the utilities return to financial health, we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined fashion. If we can find opportunities that meet our strategy and financial and risk criteria we will look to make investments. If we have the available cash flow and cant find value creating investments, we intend to return that capital to shareholders and pay down debt. We believe that we will have sufficient capital resources, both internal and external, to balance anticipated capital requirements. Financing Activities We continually evaluate our leverage targets to ensure that they are consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating. Since our merger with MCN Energy in 2001, we have been successful in reducing our leverage. Given the present environment in our industry, the increase in regulatory assets, and the nature of the electric Customer Choice program and other uncertainties, we may need to further lower our leverage in the future. Our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend as to fixed and variable interest rates and maturity. We have completed a number of refinancings over the past several years with the effect of extending the average maturity of our long term debt. The extension of the average maturity was accomplished at interest rates which have lowered our debt costs. Variable rate debt is principally in the form of outstanding commercial paper. Additionally, we have interest rate derivatives that effectively converts fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. Variable rate debt represents approximately 10% of our total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2003. 47 Table of Contents Our net cash related to financing activities decreased $1.0 billion in 2003 and decreased $1.7 billion in 2002. The 2003 change was due to higher redemptions of long term debt and lower proceeds from issuances of new debt and common stock. In 2002, proceeds from the issuance of debt and common stock were used for the redemption of higher cost debt and to reduce short term borrowings. The 2001 issuance of $1.75 billion of securitization bonds and the 2001 issuance of $1.35 billion of long term debt to finance the acquisition of MCN Energy impacts the comparison between 2002 and 2001. In 2001, proceeds from the issuance of securitization bonds and other Detroit Edison and MichCon debt were used to repay higher priced debt and repurchase our common stock. Details of 2003 financing activities follows (Note 9): MichCon issued $200 million of 5.7% senior notes due in March 2033. The proceeds were used for debt redemption and general corporate purposes. DTE Energy issued $400 million of 6 3/8% senior notes due in April 2033. In conjunction with this issuance, DTE Energy exchanged $100 million principal amount of existing debt due April 2008. The proceeds were used for debt redemptions and general corporate purposes. DTE Energy redeemed $100 million principal amount of 6.17% Remarketed Notes due in 2038. Detroit Edison issued $49 million of 5.5% tax exempt bonds due in 2030. The proceeds were used to redeem $49 million of 6.55% tax exempt bonds due 2024. Outlook Our goal is to maintain a healthy balance sheet. We intend on maintaining a high investment grade credit rating and maintaining leverage in the 50% to 55% range (excluding certain debt, principally securitization debt). We expect to contribute $170 million of DTE Energy common stock to our pension plan in the first quarter of 2004. This contribution will modestly improve our leverage. Additionally, we expect to continue the practice of issuing new DTE Energy shares for our dividend reinvestment plan. We believe this is a cost effective means of raising new equity. Debt maturing in 2004 totals approximately $500 million and we called $100 million of Trust preferred linked securities in late 2003. In addition, there are outstanding debt instruments that are likely to be economic to redeem and refund with new debt in 2004. The Company expects to continue to take advantage of low historical long term interest rates and issue new securities with a longer life than the securities maturing or called. As of December 31, 2003, DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon have effective shelf registrations with the SEC that allow for the issuance of up to an additional $1.3 billion of debt and $850 million of equity securities. We have authorization from the DTE Energy Board to repurchase approximately 9.5 million shares of our common stock. No shares have been repurchased under this authorization since early 2002. Future repurchases are not presently contemplated and will depend upon future market conditions and the Companys financial condition. In October 2003, DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon entered into separate revolving credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $1.3 billion. These facilities support our use of letters of credit and the issuance of commercial paper. Borrowing available under these revolving credit facilities totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2003. Our revolving credit facilities contain customary covenants, including the requirement to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of not more than .65 to 1, and an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to interest ratio of no less than 2 to 1. As of December 31, 2003, our debt to total capitalization ratio as computed under the terms of the agreement was .50 to 1 and our EBITDA to interest ratio was 3.6 to 1. We anticipate having the need and the ability to renew these credit facilities prior to their expiration at fair and reasonable market rates as determined at the time of negotiation. Additionally, Detroit Edison has a $200 million short term financing agreement secured by customer accounts receivable of which $100 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2003. The agreement contains certain covenants related to the delinquency of accounts receivable. Detroit Edison is currently in compliance with these covenants. For additional information see Note 10 Short Term Credit Arrangements and Borrowings. Contractual Obligations The following table details our contractual obligations for debt redemptions, leases, purchase obligations and other long term obligations as of December 31, 2003.

An unfavorable change in our rating could restrict our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase our borrowing costs. We have issued guarantees for the benefit of various non regulated subsidiaries. In the event that our credit rating is downgraded two levels and would therefore be below investment grade, certain of these guarantees would require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately $290 million at December 31, 2003. Additionally, our trading business could be required to cease operations and our access to the short term commercial paper market would be restricted or eliminated. While we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade, we cannot predict the outcome of current or future reviews. The following table shows our credit rating as determined by three nationally respected credit rating agencies. All ratings are considered investment grade and affect the value of the related securities. Credit Rating Agency Moodys Standard Investors Poors Service Fitch Ratings DTE Energy Senior Unsecured Debt BBB * Baa2 * BBB Detroit Edison Senior Secured Debt A * A3 * A MichCon Senior Secured Debt BBB * A2 ** A * Currently on negative outlook ** Currently being reviewed for possible downgrade 48 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES There are estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements that require considerable judgment. Such estimates relate to regulation, risk management and trading activities, Section 29 tax credits, goodwill, pension and post retirement costs, and the allowance for doubtful accounts. Regulation A significant portion of our business is subject to regulation. Detroit Edison and MichCon currently meet the criteria of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Application of this standard results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non regulated businesses. SFAS No. 71 requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non regulated businesses. Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in discontinuing the application of SFAS No. 71 for some or all of our businesses. If we were to discontinue the application of SFAS No. 71 on all our operations, we estimate that the extraordinary loss would be as follows: (in millions) Regulated Entity Detroit Edison (1) $ (18 ) MichCon (40 ) Total $ (58 ) (1) Excludes securitized regulatory assets Management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of SFAS No. 71 and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment (Note 4). Risk Management and Trading Activities All derivatives are recorded at fair value and shown as Assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities in the consolidated statement of financial position. Risk management activities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Through December 2002, trading activities were accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. Effective January 2003, trading activities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133. See Note 2 New Accounting Pronouncements. The offsetting entry to Assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities is to other comprehensive income or earnings depending on the use of the derivative, how it is designated and if it qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair values of derivative contracts were adjusted each reporting period for changes using market sources such as: published exchange traded market data prices from external sources price based on valuation models Market quotes are more readily available for short duration contracts. Derivative contracts are only marked to market to the extent that markets are considered highly liquid where objective, transparent prices can be obtained. Unrealized gains and losses are fully reserved for transactions that do not meet this criterion. 49 Table of Contents Section 29 Tax Credits We have generated Section 29 tax credits from our synfuel, coke battery, biomass and gas production operations. All of our synthetic fuel facilities have received favorable private letter rulings from the IRS with respect to their operations. All Section 29 tax credits taken after 1997 are subject to audit by the IRS, and if we fail to prevail through the administrative and legal process, there could be a significant tax liability owed for previously taken Section 29 tax credits. Four of our synfuel facilities are under audit by the IRS for 2001 and are expected to be completed in 2004. Our portion of tax credits generated was $241 million in 2003 as compared to $250 million in 2002 and $165 million in 2001. Outside firms assist us in assuring we operate in accordance with our private letter rulings and within the parameters of the law, as well as calculating the value of tax credits. Goodwill Certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations (Note 1). In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired. In order to perform these impairment tests, we must determine the reporting units fair value using valuation techniques, which use estimates of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit. These cash flow estimates involve judgments based on a broad range of information and historical results. To the extent estimated cash flows are revised downward, the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings. Based on our 2003 goodwill impairment test, we determined that no impairment existed. As of December 31, 2003, our goodwill totaled $2.1 billion. Pension and Postretirement Costs Our costs of providing pension and postretirement benefits are dependent upon a number of factors, including rates of return on plan assets, the discount rate, the rate of increase in health care costs and the amount and timing of plan sponsor contributions. We had pension costs for qualified pension plans of $47 million in 2003, pension income of $9 million in 2002 and pension costs of $159 million in 2001. Postretirement benefits costs for all plans was $118 million in 2003, $70 million in 2002 and $104 million in 2001. Pension and postretirement benefits cost is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long term rate of return on our plan assets of 9.0% at December 31, 2003. In developing our expected long term rate of return assumption, we evaluated input from our consultants, including their review of asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond markets. Our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 65% in equity markets, 28% in fixed income markets, and 7% invested in other assets. Because of market volatility, we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate. Given market conditions we believe that 9.0% is a reasonable long term rate of return on our plan assets. We will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions, including our expected rate of return, at least annually. We base our determination of the expected return on qualified plan assets on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic manner over a three year period. Because of this method, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. We have unrecognized net losses due to the recent unfavorable performance of the financial markets. As of December 31, 2003, we had $7 million of cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets. The discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating 50 Table of Contents agency. The discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from 6.75% at December 31, 2002 to 6.25% at December 31, 2003. Due to recent financial market performance, lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates, we estimate that our 2004 pension costs will approximate $100 million compared to $54 million in 2003 and our 2004 postretirement benefit costs will approximate $135 million compared to $118 million in 2003. We have made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings impact of higher costs. Future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design. Lowering the expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by 1.0% would have increased our 2003 qualified pension costs by approximately $22 million. Lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by 1.0% would have increased our pension costs for 2003 by approximately $11 million. Lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by 1.0% would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2003 by approximately $16 million. The market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets has been affected by declines in the financial markets in recent years. The value of our plan assets decreased from $2.8 billion at December 31, 2001, to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2002. The value at December 31, 2003 increased to $2.9 billion. The investment performance returns and declining discount rates required us to recognize at December 31, 2002, an additional minimum pension liability of $855 million, an intangible asset of $57 million and an entry to other comprehensive loss (shareholders equity) of $518 million, net of tax. As of December 31, 2003, we recognized a decrease in minimum pension liability of $75 million, a decrease in intangible assets of $13 million and a decrease in other comprehensive loss (a component of shareholders equity) of $647 million ($421 million after tax). The additional minimum pension liability and related accounting entries will be reversed on the balance sheet in future periods if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated pension benefit obligations. The recording of the minimum pension liability does not affect net income or cash flow. Pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements will increase in future years without a substantial recovery in the financial markets. We made a $35 million cash contribution to the pension plan in 2002 and a $222 million cash contribution in 2003. We anticipate making an approximate $170 million contribution to our pension plan in the form of DTE Energy common stock in the first quarter of 2004. We also contributed $33 million to the postretirement plans in 2002. We did not contribute to the postretirement plans in 2003, and made a $40 million contribution in January 2004. In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act was signed into law. This Act provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law. We have not quantified the impact of the Act, if any, on our plan. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, economic conditions, age of receivables and other information. With the implementation of a new integrated utility billing system in late 2001, we encountered billing issues as is typical with large scale system implementations. While we have resolved the primary billing issues, we may encounter difficulty in collecting past due receivables. Higher customer bills due to increased gas prices, the lack of adequate levels of assistance for low income customers and economic conditions have also contributed to the increase in past due receivables. As a result of these factors, our allowance for doubtful accounts increased in 2002 and 2003. We believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates. However, failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables would unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow. 51 Table of Contents ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Protecting the environment, as well as correcting past environmental damage, continues to be a focus of state and federal regulators. Legislation and (or) rulemaking could further impact the electric utility industry including Detroit Edison. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality have aggressive programs to clean up contaminated property. The EPA ozone transport regulations and final new air quality standards relating to ozone and particulate air pollution will continue to impact us. Detroit Edison has spent approximately $560 million through December 2003 and estimates that it will spend approximately $40 million in 2004 and incur up to an additional $1.2 billion of future capital expenditures over the next five to eight years to satisfy both existing and proposed new control requirements. Recovery of costs to be incurred through December 2004 is included in our June 2003 electric rate case. In addition, we maintain the option to securitize these costs after the completion of our current regulatory proceedings. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations of the Clean Air Act, asserting that older, coal fired power plants have been modified in ways that would require them to comply with the more restrictive new source provisions of the Clean Air Act. Detroit Edison received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject. The EPA has not initiated proceedings against Detroit Edison. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio Eastern Division issued a decision in August 2003 finding Ohio Edison Company in violation of the new source provisions of the Clean Air Act. If the Courts decision is upheld, the electric utility industry could be required to invest substantial amounts in pollution control equipment. During the same month, however, a district court in a different division rendered a conflicting decision on the matter. On August 27, 2003, the EPA released new rules, effective December 26, 2003, allowing repair, replacement or upgrade of production equipment without triggering source requirement controls if the cost of the parts and repairs do not exceed 20% of the replacement value of the equipment being upgraded. Such repairs will be considered routine maintenance, however any changes in emissions would be subject to existing pollution permit limits and other state and federal programs for pollutants. Several states and environmental organizations have challenged these regulations and on December 24, 2003, were granted a stay until the U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit hears the arguments on the case. We cannot predict the future impact of this issue upon Detroit Edison. DTE ENERGY OPERATING SYSTEM AND DTE2 During 2002, we adopted The DTE Energy Operating System, which is a philosophy that involves the application of tools and operating practices that have resulted in inventory reductions and improvements in technology systems, among other enhancements. Operation and maintenance expenses benefited from our company wide initiative to pursue cost efficiencies and enhance operating performance. We expect continued cost containment efforts and process improvements. In 2003, we began the implementation of DTE2, a company wide initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems including, finance, human resources, supply chain and work management. We expect to incrementally spend approximately $150 million to $175 million over the next 3 to 4 years to implement these new processes and systems. We expect the benefits to outweigh this investment primarily from lower costs, faster business cycles, repeatable and optimized processes, enhanced internal controls, improvements in inventory management and reductions in system support costs.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk DTE Energy has commodity price risk arising from market price fluctuations in conjunction with the anticipated purchase of electricity to meet its obligations during periods of peak demand. We also are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations on gas sale and purchase contracts, gas production and gas inventories. To limit our exposure to commodity price fluctuations, we have entered into a series of electricity and gas futures, forwards, option and swap contracts. See Note 15 Financial and Other Derivative Instruments for further discussion. Interest Rate Risk DTE Energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt and preferred securities. In order to manage interest costs, we use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements. Our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in U.S. Treasury rates, commercial paper rates and London Inter Bank Offered Rates (LIBOR). Foreign Currency Risk DTE Energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts. These contracts are denominated in Canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of power as well as for long term transportation capacity. To limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, we have entered into a series of currency forward contracts through 2008. Summary of Sensitivity Analysis We performed a sensitivity analysis calculating the impact of changes in fair values utilizing applicable forward commodity rates or changes in interest rates if they occurred at December 31, 2003: (in Millions)Activity Increase of 10% Decrease of 10 % Change in the fair value of Gas Contracts $ (8 ) $ 9 Commodity contracts Power Contracts $ (8 ) $ 8 Commodity contracts Interest Rate Risk $ (303 ) $ 323 Long term debt Foreign Currency Risk $ .2 $ (.2 ) Forward contracts 54 Table of Contents Credit Risk Bankruptcies We purchase and sell electricity, gas, coal and coke from and to numerous companies operating in the steel, automotive, energy and retail industries. A number of customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. We have negotiated or are currently involved in negotiations with each of the companies, or their successor companies, that have filed for bankruptcy protection. We regularly review contingent matters relating to purchase and sale contracts and record provisions for amounts considered probable of loss. We believe our accrued amounts are adequate for probable losses. The final resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements in the period they are resolved.
