Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW DTE Energy is a diversified energy company with 2009 operating revenues in excess of $8 billion and over $24 billion in assets. We are the parent company of Detroit Edison and MichCon, regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales, distribution and storage services throughout southeastern Michigan. We operate four energy related non utility segments with operations throughout the United States. The following table summarizes our financial results: 2009 2008 2007 (in Millions, except earnings per share) Income from continuing operations $ 535 $ 531 $ 791 Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations $ 3.24 $ 3.22 $ 4.61 Net income attributable to DTE Energy Company $ 532 $ 546 $ 971 Diluted earnings per common share $ 3.24 $ 3.34 $ 5.69 The decrease in 2009 Net income attributable to DTE Energy from 2008 was primarily due to the $80 million after tax gain recorded in the Unconventional Gas Production segment on the 2008 sale of a portion of Barnett shale properties, partially offset by higher earnings in the Electric Utility and Energy Trading segments. The decrease in Net income attributable to DTE Energy in 2008 from 2007 was primarily due to $370 million in net income resulting from the $580 million after tax gain on the 2007 sale of the Antrim shale gas exploration and production business, partially offset by $210 million after tax losses recognized on related hedges, including recognition of amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income during 2007. The items discussed below influenced our current financial performance and or may affect future results: Impacts of national and regional economic conditions; Effects of weather on utility operations; Collectibility of accounts receivable on utility operations; Impact of regulatory decisions on utility operations; Non utility operations; Capital investments, including required renewable, energy efficiency, environmental, reliability related and other costs; and Environmental matters. Reference in this report to we, us, our, Company or DTE are to DTE Energy and its subsidiaries, collectively. UTILITY OPERATIONS Our Electric Utility segment consists of Detroit Edison, which is engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 2.1 million customers in southeastern Michigan. Our Gas Utility segment consists of MichCon and Citizens. MichCon is engaged in the purchase, storage, transmission, distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 1.2 million customers throughout Michigan. Citizens distributes natural gas in Adrian, Michigan to approximately 17,000 customers. 31 Table of Contents Impact of National and Regional Economic Conditions Revenues from our utility operations follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve. Unfavorable national and regional economic trends have resulted in reduced demand for electricity and natural gas in our service territory with corresponding declines in our revenues. 2009 2008 2007 (in Millions) Revenues Detroit Edison $ 4,714 $ 4,874 $ 4,900 MichCon 1,788 2,152 1,875 During 2009, Detroit Edison experienced decreases in sales, predominantly in the industrial class, and to a lesser extent in the residential and commercial classes, partially offset by higher interconnection sales. MichCons revenues were lower due primarily to lower natural gas costs and customer conservation. We expect to minimize the impacts of declines in average customer usage through regulatory mechanisms which will decouple our revenue levels from sales volumes. We expect to be impacted by the challenges in the domestic automotive and steel industries and the timing and level of recovery in the national and regional economies. Direct and indirect effects of further automotive and other industrial plant closures could have a significant impact on the results of Detroit Edison. As discussed further below, deteriorating economic conditions impact our ability to collect amounts due from our electric and gas customers and drive increased thefts of electricity and natural gas. In the face of these economic conditions, we are actively managing our cash, capital expenditures, cost structure and liquidity to maintain our financial strength. Collectibility of Accounts Receivable on Utility Operations Although lower than peak levels in 2008, both utilities continue to experience high levels of past due receivables primarily attributable to economic conditions. Our service territories continue to experience high levels of unemployment, underemployment and low income households, home foreclosures and a lack of adequate levels of assistance for low income customers. Despite the current economic conditions, total arrears were reduced during 2009 in our electric and gas utilities. We have taken actions to manage the level of past due receivables, including increasing customer disconnections, contracting with collection agencies and working with Michigan officials and others to increase the share of low income funding allocated to our customers. 2009 2008 2007 (in Millions) Uncollectible Expense Detroit Edison $ 78 $ 87 $ 65 MichCon 93 126 70 $ 171 $ 213 $ 135 The MPSC has provided for an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism for MichCon since 2005. The uncollectible expense tracking mechanism enables MichCon to recover or refund 90 percent of the difference between the actual uncollectible expense for each year and $37 million after an annual reconciliation proceeding before the MPSC. The January 2010 MPSC electric rate order provided for an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism for Detroit Edison. The uncollectible expense tracking mechanism enables Detroit Edison to recover or refund 80 percent of the difference between the actual uncollectible expense for each year and $66 million after an annual reconciliation proceeding before the MPSC. The bankruptcies of General Motors Corporation (GM) and Chrysler LLC (Chrysler) did not have a significant impact to our uncollectible expense in 2009. 32 Table of Contents Impact of Regulatory Decisions on Utility Operations On January 11, 2010, the MPSC issued an order in Detroit Edisons January 26, 2009 rate case filing. The MPSC approved an annual revenue increase of $217 million or a 4.8% increase in Detroit Edisons annual revenue requirement for 2010. Included in the approved increase in revenues was a return on equity of 11% on an expected 49% equity and 51% debt permanent capital structure. Since the final rate relief ordered was less than the Companys self implemented rate increase of $280 million effective on July 26, 2009, the MPSC ordered refunds for the period the self implemented rates were in effect. Detroit Edison has recorded a refund liability of $27 million at December 31, 2009 representing the 2009 portion of the estimated refund due customers, including interest. The MPSC ordered Detroit Edison to file a refund plan by April 1, 2010. Other key aspects of the MPSC order include the following: Continued progress toward correcting the existing rate structure to more accurately reflect the actual cost of providing service to business customers; Continued application of an adjustment mechanism for Electric Choice sales that reconciles actual customer choice sales with a base customer choice sales level of 1,586 GWh; Continued application of adjustment mechanisms to track expenses associated with restoration costs (storm and non storm related expenses) and line clearance expenses. Annual reconciliations will be required using a base expense level of $117 million and $47 million, respectively. The change in base expense level was applied retroactive to the July 26, 2009 self implementation date; Implementation of a pilot Revenue Decoupling Mechanism, that will compare actual (non weather normalized) sales per customer with the base sales per customer level established in this case for the period February 1, 2010 to January 31, 2011; and Implementation of an Uncollectible Expense Tracking Mechanism, based on a $66 million expense level, with an 80/20 percent sharing of the expenses above or below the base amount. The Uncollectible Expenses Tracking Mechanism was implemented retroactive to the July 26, 2009 self implementation date. MichCon filed a general rate case on June 9, 2009 based on a 2008 historical test year. The filing with the MPSC requested a $193 million, or 11.5 percent average increase in MichCons annual revenues for a 2010 projected test year. The requested $193 million increase in revenues is required to recover the increased costs associated with increased investments in net plant and working capital, an increase in the base level of the uncollectible expense tracking mechanism and the cost of natural gas theft primarily due to economic conditions in Michigan, sales reductions due to customer conservation and the trend of warmer weather on MichCons market, and increasing operating costs, largely due to inflation. Pursuant to the October 2008 Michigan legislation, and the settlement in MichCons last base gas sale case, MichCon self implemented $170 million of its requested annual increase on January 1, 2010. This increase will remain in place until a final order is issued by the MPSC, which is expected in June 2010, subject to refund. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. NON UTILITY OPERATIONS We have significant investments in non utility businesses. We employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing opportunities that leverage our assets, skills and expertise. Specifically, we invest in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with our risk profile. We expect growth opportunities in the Gas Storage and Pipelines and Power and Industrial Projects segments in the future. Expansion of these businesses will also result in our ability to further diversify geographically. Gas Storage and Pipelines owns partnership interests in two natural gas storage fields and two interstate pipelines serving the Midwest, Ontario and Northeast markets. Much of the growth in demand for natural gas is expected to occur in the Mid Atlantic and New England regions. Forecasts indicate that these regions will require incremental gas storage and pipeline infrastructure to meet demand growth. Our Vector and 33 Table of Contents Millennium pipelines are well positioned to provide access routes and low cost expansion options to these markets. Our Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in natural gas exploration, development and production within the Barnett shale in north Texas. We continue to develop our holdings in the western portion of the Barnett shale and to seek opportunities for additional monetization of select properties within our Barnett shale holdings, when conditions are appropriate. Due to economic conditions and low natural gas prices during the year, we chose to do minimal lease acquisitions and reduce the number of new wells this year. However, we continue to evaluate leasing opportunities in active development areas in the Barnett shale to optimize our existing portfolio. Power and Industrial Projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and products and services to industrial, commercial and institutional customers; provide coal transportation and marketing; and sell electricity from biomass fired energy projects. This business segment provides services using project assets usually located on or near the customers premises in the steel, automotive, pulp and paper, airport and other industries. Renewable energy, environmental and economic trends are creating growth opportunities. The increasing number of states with renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency mandates provides the opportunity to market the expertise of the Power and Industrial Projects segment in landfill gas, on site energy management, waste wood power generation, and other related services. Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from DTE Energys asset portfolio, and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage, and power transmission and generating capacity positions. Energy Trading also provides natural gas, power and ancillary services to various utilities which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Synthetic Fuel The Synthetic Fuel business was presented as a non utility segment through the third quarter of 2007. Due to the expiration of synfuel production tax credits at the end of 2007, the Synthetic Fuel business ceased operations and was classified as a discontinued operation as of December 31, 2007. CAPITAL INVESTMENTS We anticipate significant capital investments during the next three years concentrated primarily in Detroit Edison. 2010 2012 (in Billions) Capital Investments Detroit Edison $ 3.0 3.4 MichCon 0.4 0.5 Non Utility 0.6 0.9 $ 4.0 4.8 Our utility businesses require significant capital investments each year in order to maintain and improve the reliability of their asset bases, including power generation plants, distribution systems, storage fields and other facilities and fleets. In addition, Detroit Edisons investments (excluding investments in new base load generation capacity, if any) will be driven by renewable investment and environmental controls expenditures. We plan to seek regulatory approval to include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment. Non utility investments are expected primarily in continued investment in gas storage and pipeline assets and renewable opportunities in the Power and Industrial Projects businesses. 34 Table of Contents ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We are subject to extensive environmental regulation. Additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented. Actual costs to comply could vary substantially. We expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers. Air Detroit Edison is subject to the EPA ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Since 2005, EPA and the State of Michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate, regional haze and mercury air pollution. The new rules will lead to additional controls on fossil fueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions. Further, additional rulemakings are expected over the next few years which could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and hazardous air pollutants. It is not possible to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this time. In July 2009, DTE Energy received a Notice of Violation/Finding of Violation (NOV/FOV) from the EPA alleging, among other things, that five Detroit Edison power plants violated New Source Performance standards, Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements, and Title V operating permit requirements under the Clean Air Act. We believe that the plants identified by the EPA have complied with applicable regulations. Depending upon the outcome of our discussions with the EPA regarding the NOV/FOV, the EPA could bring legal action against Detroit Edison. We could also be required to install additional pollution control equipment at some or all of the power plants in question, engage in Supplemental Environmental Programs, and or pay fines. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter, or the timing of its resolution. Water In response to an EPA regulation, Detroit Edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities. Based on the results of studies, some of which have already been completed, but more are expected to be conducted over the next several years, Detroit Edison may be required to perform some mitigation activities, including the possible installation of additional control technologies to reduce the environmental impact of the intake structures. However, a January 2007 circuit court decision remanded back to the EPA several provisions of the federal regulation, resulting in a delay in complying with the regulation. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the remanded cost benefit analysis provision of the rule and in April 2009 upheld EPAs use of this provision in determining best available technology for reducing environmental impacts. Concurrently, the EPA continues to develop a revised rule, a draft of which is expected to be published by summer 2010. The EPA has also proposed an information collection request to begin a review of steam electric effluent guidelines. It is not possible at this time to quantify the impacts of these developing requirements. Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) and Other Sites Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal, coke or oil. The facilities, which produced gas for heating and other uses, have been designated as MGP sites. Gas Utility owns, or previously owned, fifteen such former MGP sites. Detroit Edison owns, or previously owned, three former MGP sites. In addition to the MGP sites, we are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations. These other sites include an engineered ash storage facility, electrical distribution substations, gas pipelines, and underground and aboveground storage tank locations. Cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years. Landfill Detroit Edison owns and operates a permitted engineered ash storage facility at the Monroe Power Plant to dispose of fly ash from the coal fired power plant. Detroit Edison performed an engineering analysis in 2009 and identified the need for embankment side slope repairs and reconstruction. The results of the engineering study show that the estimated cost to perform the embankment repairs are $17 million which we expect to incur over the next four years. The EPA has expressed its intentions to develop new federal regulations for coal ash under the authority of the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). A proposed regulation is expected in the first 35 Table of Contents quarter of 2010. Among the options EPA is currently considering, is a ruling that may designate coal ash as a Hazardous Waste as defined by RCRA. However, agencies and legislatures have urged EPA to regulate coal ash as a non hazardous waste. If EPA were to designate coal ash as a hazardous waste, the agency could apply some, or all, of the disposal and reuse standards that have been applied to other existing hazardous wastes. Some of the regulatory actions currently being contemplated could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers. Global Climate Change Climate regulation and or legislation is being proposed and discussed within the U.S. Congress and the EPA. On June 26, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACESA). The ACESA includes a cap and trade program that would start in 2012 and provides for costs to emit greenhouse gases. Despite action by the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee to pass a similar but more stringent bill in October 2009, full Senate action on a climate bill is not expected before the spring of 2010. Meanwhile, the EPA is beginning to implement regulatory actions under the Clean Air Act to address emission of greenhouse gases. Pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers. Impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned, financing costs related to additional capital expenditures and the purchase of emission allowances from market sources. We would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to our utility customers. Increased costs for energy produced from traditional sources could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable and or nuclear sources and energy efficiency initiatives and the development of market based trading of carbon offsets providing business opportunities for our utility and non utility segments. It is not possible to quantify these impacts on DTE Energy or its customers at this time. See Notes 12 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and Items 1 and 2 Business and Properties. OUTLOOK The next few years will be a period of rapid change for DTE Energy and for the energy industry. Our strong utility base, combined with our integrated non utility operations, position us well for long term growth. Looking forward, we will focus on several areas that we expect will improve future performance: continuing to pursue regulatory stability and investment recovery for our utilities; managing the growth of our utility asset base; enhancing our cost structure across all business segments; managing cash, capital and liquidity to maintain or improve our financial strength; improving Electric and Gas Utility customer satisfaction; and investing in businesses that integrate our assets and leverage our skills and expertise. We will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined manner if we can secure opportunities that meet our strategic, financial and risk criteria. 36 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of our segments. 2009 2008 2007 (in Millions) Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy by Segment: Electric Utility $ 376 $ 331 $ 317 Gas Utility 80 85 70 Gas Storage and Pipelines 49 38 34 Unconventional Gas Production(1) (9 ) 84 (217 ) Power and Industrial Projects 31 40 49 Energy Trading 75 42 32 Corporate Other(1) (70 ) (94 ) 502 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations: Utility 456 416 387 Non utility 146 204 (102 ) Corporate Other (70 ) (94 ) 502 532 526 787 Discontinued Operations 20 184 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company $ 532 $ 546 $ 971 (1) 2008 net income of the Unconventional Gas Production segment resulted principally from the gain on the sale of a portion of our Barnett shale properties. 2007 net loss resulted principally from the recognition of losses on hedge contracts associated with the Antrim sale transaction. 2007 net income of the Corporate Other segment resulted principally from the gain recognized on the Antrim sale transaction. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. ELECTRIC UTILITY Our Electric Utility segment consists of Detroit Edison. Electric Utility results are discussed below: 2009 2008 2007 (in Millions) Operating Revenues $ 4,714 $ 4,874 $ 4,900 Fuel and Purchased Power 1,491 1,778 1,686 Gross Margin 3,223 3,096 3,214 Operation and Maintenance 1,277 1,322 1,422 Depreciation and Amortization 844 743 764 Taxes Other Than Income 205 232 277 Asset (Gains) Losses, Reserves and Impairments, Net (2 ) (1 ) 8 Operating Income 899 800 743 Other (Income) and Deductions 295 283 277 Income Tax Provision 228 186 149 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company $ 376 $ 331 $ 317 Operating Income as a Percent of Operating Revenues 19 % 16 % 15 % 37 Table of Contents Gross margin increased $127 million during 2009 and decreased $118 million in 2008.

Operation and maintenance expense decreased $45 million in 2009 and decreased $100 million in 2008. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to $71 million from continuous improvement initiatives and other cost reductions resulting in lower contract labor and outside services expense, information technology and other staff expenses, $14 million of lower employee benefit related expenses, lower storm expenses of $12 million, $9 million of reduced uncollectible expenses and $6 million of reduced maintenance activities, partially offset by higher pension and health care costs of $54 million and $14 million of energy optimization and renewable energy expenses. The decrease in 2008 was due primarily to lower information systems implementation costs of $60 million, lower employee benefit related expenses of $45 million and $29 million from continuous improvement initiatives resulting in lower contract labor and outside services expense, information technology and other staff expenses, partially offset by higher uncollectible expenses of $22 million. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $101 million in 2009 due primarily to a higher depreciable base and increased amortization of regulatory assets and decreased $21 million in 2008 due primarily to decreased amortization of regulatory assets. Taxes other than income were lower by $27 million due primarily to a $30 million reduction in property tax expense due to refunds received in settlement of appeals of assessments for prior years. Taxes decreased $45 million in 2008 due to the Michigan Single Business Tax (SBT) expense in 2007, which was replaced with the Michigan Business Tax (MBT) in 2008. The MBT is accounted for in the Income Tax provision. Outlook Unfavorable national and regional economic trends have resulted in reduced demand for electricity in our service territory and continued high levels in our uncollectible accounts receivable. The magnitude of these trends will be driven by the impacts of the challenges in the domestic automotive industry and the timing and level of recovery in the national and regional economies. The January 2010 MPSC rate order, provided for an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism and a revenue decoupling mechanism will assist in mitigating these impacts. To address the challenges of the national and regional economies, we continue to move forward in our efforts to improve the operating performance and cash flow of Detroit Edison. We continue to favorably resolve outstanding regulatory issues, many of which were addressed by Michigan legislation. We expect that our planned significant environmental and renewable expenditures will result in earnings growth. Looking forward, we face additional issues, such as higher levels of capital spending, volatility in prices for coal and other commodities, investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs, and uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change. We expect to continue 39 Table of Contents an intense focus on our continuous improvement efforts to improve productivity, remove waste and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction. GAS UTILITY Our Gas Utility segment consists of MichCon and Citizens. Gas Utility results are discussed below: 2009 2008 2007 (in Millions) Operating Revenues $ 1,788 $ 2,152 $ 1,875 Cost of Gas 1,057 1,378 1,164 Gross Margin 731 774 711 Operation and Maintenance 415 464 429 Depreciation and Amortization 107 102 93 Taxes Other Than Income 49 48 56 Asset (Gains) and Losses, Net (18 ) (26 ) (3 ) Operating Income 178 186 136 Other (Income) and Deductions 59 60 43 Income Tax Provision 39 41 23 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company $ 80 $ 85 $ 70 Operating Income as a Percent of Operating Revenues 10 % 9 % 7 % Gross margin decreased $43 million in 2009 and increased $63 million in 2008. The decrease in 2009 reflects $28 million of lower revenues from the uncollectible tracking mechanism, $15 million of additional lost and stolen gas, $12 million of continued customer conservation efforts, $5 million of lower end user transportation revenue, $5 million of realized hedging losses, the effects of unfavorable weather of $4 million and reduced late payment revenue of $4 million, partially offset by $22 million higher midstream transportation and storage revenues, $5 million in energy optimization revenues and $5 million higher appliance service revenues. The increase in 2008 reflects $49 million from the uncollectible tracking mechanism, $15 million related to the impacts of colder weather, $10 million favorable result of lower lost gas recognized and higher valued gas received as compensation for transportation of third party customer gas, $7 million of 2007 GCR disallowances, and $6 million of appliance repair revenue. The 2008 improvement was partially offset by $19 million of lower storage services revenue and $12 million from customer conservation and lower volumes. 2009 2008 2007 (in Millions) Gas Markets Gas sales $ 1,443 $ 1,824 $ 1,536 End user transportation 144 143 140 Intermediate transportation 69 73 70 Storage and other 132 112 129 $ 1,788 $ 2,152 $ 1,875 Gas Markets (in Bcf) Gas sales 137 148 148 End user transportation 124 123 132 261 271 280 Intermediate transportation 463 438 399 724 709 679 40 Table of Contents Operation and maintenance expense decreased $49 million in 2009 and increased $35 million in 2008. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to $33 million of reduced uncollectible expenses, $15 million of lower employee benefit related expenses, $14 million from continuous improvement initiatives and other cost reductions resulting in lower contract labor and outside services expense, information technology and other staff expenses, partially offset by higher health care expenses of $8 million and $4 million of energy optimization expenses. The 2008 increase is primarily attributable to $56 million of higher uncollectible expenses, partially offset by $14 million from continuous improvement initiatives resulting in lower contract labor and outside services expense, information technology and other staff expenses and $14 million of reduced pension and health care expenses. Uncollectible expense was higher in 2008 due to an analysis of our greater than ninety day receivables that indicated a change in the mix of customers in that group and therefore an increased risk of collection. The changes in uncollectible expenses are substantially offset by changes in revenues from the uncollectible tracking mechanism included in the gross margin discussion. Asset (gains) losses, net decreased $8 million due to a lower gain on the sale of base gas of $15 million and a gain related to the sale of certain gathering and processing assets. The 2008 increase of $23 million was due primarily to the sale of base gas. Outlook Unfavorable national and regional economic trends have resulted in a decrease in the number of customers in our service territory, customer conservation and continued high levels of theft and uncollectible accounts receivable. The magnitude of these trends will be driven by the impacts of the challenges in the domestic automotive industry and the timing and level of recovery in the national and regional economies. The uncollectible tracking mechanism provided by the MPSC assists in mitigating the continued pressure on accounts receivable. To address the challenges of the national and regional economies, we continue to move forward in our efforts to improve the operating performance and cash flow of Gas Utility. We continue to resolve outstanding regulatory issues. Looking forward, we face additional issues, such as volatility in gas prices, investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs. We expect to continue an intense focus on our continuous improvement efforts to improve productivity, minimize lost and stolen gas, remove waste and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction. GAS STORAGE AND PIPELINES Our Gas Storage and Pipelines segment consists of our non utility gas pipelines and storage businesses. Gas Storage and Pipelines results are discussed below: 2009 2008 2007 (in Millions) Operating Revenues $ 82 $ 71 $ 66 Operation and Maintenance 15 12 13 Depreciation and Amortization 5 5 6 Taxes Other Than Income 2 3 3 Asset (Gains) and Losses, Net 1 (1 ) Operating Income 60 50 45 Other (Income) and Deductions (23 ) (12 ) (7 ) Income Tax Provision 33 24 18 Net Income 50 38 34 Noncontrolling interest 1 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy $ 49 $ 38 $ 34 Net income attributable to DTE Energy increased $11 million and $4 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2009 increase was driven by higher operating revenues resulting from increased capacity sold and higher rates from renewing storage contracts related to long term agreements. In addition, there were 41 Table of Contents higher equity earnings from our investments in the Vector and Millennium Pipelines, reflecting a first full year of operations for Millennium. The 2008 increase is due to higher storage revenues related to expansion of capacity and higher other income primarily driven by higher equity earnings in the Vector and Millennium Pipelines, partially offset by a higher tax provision due to the MBT in 2008. Outlook Our Gas Storage and Pipelines business expects to continue its steady growth plan. In 2009, an additional 3 Bcf of storage capacity was placed in service. The Vector Pipeline Phase 2 expansion which added approximately 100 MMcf/day, was placed in service in October 2009 and is supported by customers under long term contracts. Millennium Pipeline was placed in service in December 2008 and currently has nearly 85 percent of its capacity sold to customers under long term contracts. We are also a 50 percent owner in the proposed Dawn Gateway Pipeline. The Dawn Gateway Project is designed to initially transport 360,000 dth/d from our Michigan storage facilities to the Dawn Hub in Ontario, Canada, and upon successful and timely regulatory approval, is expected to be in service in the fourth quarter 2010. UNCONVENTIONAL GAS PRODUCTION Our Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in natural gas exploration, development and production within the Barnett shale in northern Texas. In June 2007, we sold our Antrim shale gas exploration and production business in northern Michigan for gross proceeds of $1.262 billion. In January 2008, we sold a portion of our Barnett shale properties for gross proceeds of approximately $260 million. The properties sold included 75 Bcf of proved reserves on approximately 11,000 net acres in the core area of the Barnett shale. We recognized a gain of $128 million ($80 million after tax) on the sale in 2008. Unconventional Gas Production results are discussed below: 2009 2008 2007 (in Millions) Operating Revenues $ 31 $ 48 $ (228 ) Operation and Maintenance 15 22 36 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 16 12 22 Taxes Other Than Income 1 1 8 Asset (Gains) and Losses, Net 6 (120 ) 27 Operating Income (Loss) (7 ) 133 (321 ) Other (Income) and Deductions 6 2 13 Income Tax Provision (Benefit) (4 ) 47 (117 ) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to DTE Energy Company $ (9 ) $ 84 $ (217 ) Operating revenues decreased $17 million in 2009 and increased $276 million in 2008. The 2009 decrease is the result of lower commodity prices, while production remained relatively flat. The 2008 increase was principally due to the impact of losses on 2007 financial contracts that hedged our price risk exposure related to expected Antrim gas production and sales through 2013. Excluding the impact of the losses on the Antrim hedges, operating revenues decreased $47 million in 2008. The decreases were principally due to lower natural gas sales volumes as a result of our monetization initiatives, partially offset by higher commodity prices and higher gas and oil production on retained wells. Operation and maintenance expense decreased $7 million in 2009 due to operational efficiencies and lower costs for goods and services. The 2008 decrease is primarily attributable to the sale of a portion of the Barnett shale in January 2008 and the Antrim sale in June 2007. Asset (gains) and losses, net decreased $126 in 2009 and increased $147 million in 2008. The 2009 decrease as compared to 2008 was due to the gain of $128 million ($80 million after tax) on the 2008 sale of a portion of our Barnett shale properties and $2 million lower impairment in 2009 of expired or expiring leasehold positions that the company does not intend to drill at current commodity prices. The increase in 2008 of $147 million was due to the gain on sale of Barnett shale core properties, partially offset by $8 million 42 Table of Contents of impairment losses primarily related to leases on unproved acreage that we did not anticipate developing due to economic conditions. Outlook In the longer term, we plan to continue to develop our holdings in the western portion of the Barnett shale and to seek opportunities for additional monetization of select properties within our asset base, when conditions are appropriate. Our strategy for 2010 is to maintain our focus on reducing operating expenses and optimizing production volume. During 2010, we expect to invest approximately $25 million to drill 10 to 15 new wells and achieve production of approximately 5 Bcfe of natural gas, compared with 5 Bcfe in 2009. POWER AND INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS Power and Industrial Projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utility type products and services to industrial, commercial and institutional customers; provide coal transportation services and marketing; and sell electricity from biomass fired energy projects. Power and Industrial Projects results are discussed below: 2009 2008 2007 (in Millions) Operating Revenues $ 661 $ 987 $ 1,244 Operation and Maintenance 593 899 1,143 Depreciation and Amortization 40 34 41 Taxes other than Income 9 12 13 Other Asset (Gains) and Losses, Reserves and Impairments, Net (6 ) 6 Operating Income 25 36 47 Other (Income) and Deductions (1 ) (20 ) (11 ) Income Taxes Provision 5 18 18 Production Tax Credits (12 ) (7 ) (11 ) (7 ) 11 7 Net Income 33 45 51 Noncontrolling interest 2 5 2 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company $ 31 $ 40 $ 49 Operating revenues decreased $326 million in 2009 and $257 million in 2008. The 2009 decrease is due primarily to $111 million reduction in certain coal structured transactions, $176 million of lower pricing and volumes of coal and emissions and $84 million of lower coke demand, partially offset by a $107 million increase in coal related services. The 2008 decrease was primarily attributable to $177 million of reductions in coal transportation and trading volumes and $28 million for the impact of a customer electing to purchase coal directly from the supplier. Operation and maintenance expense decreased $306 million in 2009 and $244 million in 2008. The 2009 decrease is due primarily to $111 million decrease in certain coal structured transactions and $64 million of lower coke demand, $141 million of lower pricing and volumes of coal and emissions and operating expenses, partially offset by $75 million of higher coal related services. The 2008 decrease mostly reflects $174 million of lower coal transportation costs driven by reduced sales combined with a reduction in coal trading results. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $6 million in 2009 and decreased $7 million in 2008. In 2007, we announced our plans to sell a 50% interest in a portfolio of select Power and Industrial Projects. As a result, the assets and liabilities of the Projects were classified as held for sale at that time and the Company ceased recording depreciation and amortization expense related to these assets. During the second quarter of 2008, our work on this planned monetization was discontinued and the assets and liabilities of the Projects 43 Table of Contents were no longer classified as held for sale. Depreciation and amortization resumed in June 2008 when the assets were reclassified as held and used. Other assets (gains) losses, reserves and impairments, net increased $12 million in 2009 and expense decreased $6 million in 2008. This variation in this item is due primarily to a loss recorded in 2008 of approximately $19 million related to the valuation adjustment for the cumulative depreciation and amortization upon reclassification of certain project assets as held and used, partially offset by gains attributable to the sale of one of our coke battery projects where the proceeds were dependent on future production. Production at this coke battery was operating at lower production volumes in 2009. Other (income) and deductions were lower by $19 million in 2009 due primarily to higher inter company interest associated with project construction and a reduction in equity earnings in an investment in a coke battery. Outlook The stabilization in the U.S. economy is having a positive impact on our customers in the steel industry and we expect a corresponding improvement in demand for metallurgical coke and pulverized coal supplied to these customers for 2010. We supply onsite energy services to the domestic automotive manufacturers who have also experienced stabilized demand for autos. Chrysler and GM have emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. We have been in discussions with both automakers and do not anticipate significant impacts to onsite energy services. Our onsite energy services will continue to be delivered in accordance with the terms of long term contracts. We continue to monitor developments in this sector. In 2010, we will continue to capture benefits from production tax credits generated from our steel industry fuel and our reduced emission fuel projects. We will also begin to generate production tax credits from our reduced emission fuel projects. In 2011, our existing long term rail transportation contract, which is at rates significantly below the current market, will expire and we anticipate a decrease in transportation related revenue of approximately $120 million as a result. We will continue to work with suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and competitive access to coal to meet the energy requirements of our customers. Power and Industrial Projects will continue to leverage its extensive energy related operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers. We will also continue to look for opportunities to acquire energy projects and biomass fired generating projects for favorable prices. ENERGY TRADING Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from DTE Energys asset portfolio, and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage, and power transmission and generating capacity positions. Energy Trading also provides natural gas, power and ancillary services to various utilities which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf. 44 Table of Contents Energy Trading results are discussed below: 2009 2008 2007 (in Millions) Operating Revenues $ 804 $ 1,388 $ 924 Fuel, Purchased Power and Gas 603 1,235 806 Gross Margin 201 153 118 Operation and Maintenance 71 68 58 Depreciation and Amortization 5 5 5 Taxes Other Than Income 3 2 1 Operating Income 122 78 54 Other (Income) and Deductions 10 5 5 Income Tax Provision (Benefit) 37 31 17 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company $ 75 $ 42 $ 32 Gross margin increased $48 million in 2009 and $35 million in 2008. Overall, Operating Revenues and Fuel, Purchased Power and Gas were impacted by a decrease in gas and power commodity prices in 2009 as compared to 2008. The $48 million increase in gross margin in 2009 was due to increases in realized margins of $69 million, offset by decreases in unrealized margins of $21 million. The $69 million increase in realized margins was primarily the result of increases in our gas trading strategy and timing related increases in our gas storage and transportation optimization strategies. The $21 million decrease in unrealized margins consisted of unfavorable results of $58 million from our gas trading and gas marketing and origination strategies, partially offset by increases of $29 million in our power trading and timing related improvements of $8 million in our oil strategies. The 2008 increase was due to higher unrealized margin of $66 million offset by a decrease in realized margin of $31 million. The increase in unrealized margins includes gains in our gas strategies and the absence of $30 million in mark to market losses in June 2007 reflecting revisions of valuation estimates for natural gas contracts. The decrease in realized margin was due to unfavorable results of $28 million primarily from our power marketing and transmission optimization strategies, $34 million of unfavorability in our gas storage and full requirements strategies due to falling prices in 2008, offset by $31 million of improvement in our gas trading strategy. Operation and maintenance expense increased $3 million and $10 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2009 increase was due to higher payroll and incentive costs and commissions, partially offset by lower contractor expense and allocated corporate costs. The 2008 increase is due to higher payroll and incentive costs and allocated corporate costs. Income tax provision increased $6 million in 2009 due to an increase in income taxes resulting from higher pretax income, partially offset by $10 million of favorable tax related adjustments primarily resulting from the settlement of federal income tax audits. Outlook Significant portions of the Energy Trading portfolio are economically hedged. The portfolio includes financial instruments, physical commodity contracts and gas inventory, as well as contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage, and power transmission and generation capacity positions. Energy Trading also provides power and ancillary services and natural gas to various utilities which may include the management of associated storage and transport contracts on the customers behalf. Most financial instruments and physical power and gas contracts are deemed derivatives, whereas proprietary gas inventory, power transmission, pipeline transportation and certain storage assets are not derivatives. As a result, we will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to market without revaluing the underlying non derivative contracts and assets. Our strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying non derivative contracts and assets with futures, forwards, swaps and options. This results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods. 45 Table of Contents See also the Fair Value section that follows. CORPORATE OTHER Corporate Other includes various holding company activities and holds certain non utility debt and energy related investments. Factors impacting income: The 2009 net loss of $70 million decreased from the net loss of $94 million in 2008 due to $34 million favorable tax related adjustments primarily resulting from the settlement of federal income tax audits, $10 million lower inter company interest expense and $9 million lower costs related to natural gas forward contracts associated with the 2007 sale of the Antrim Shale properties. These favorable variances were partially offset by a $10 million donation of cash and available for sale securities to the DTE Energy Foundation, $10 million resulting from a realignment of employee benefit expense from MichCon, $7 million increase in financing fees, $1 million increased impairment of investments and a $1 million decrease in interest income. The 2008 net loss of $94 million was lower than the 2007 net income of $502 million due to the 2007 gain on the sale of the Antrim shale gas exploration and production business for approximately $900 million ($580 million after tax). DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Synthetic Fuel Due to the expiration of synfuel production tax credits in 2007, the Synthetic Fuel business ceased operations and was classified as a discontinued operation as of December 31, 2007. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted ASC 820 (SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements). The cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption of ASC 820 represented a $4 million increase to the January 1, 2008 balance of retained earnings. See also the Fair Value section. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted ASC 740 (FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109). The cumulative effect of the adoption of ASC 740 represented a $5 million reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Requirements We use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our non utility businesses, retire and pay interest on long term debt and pay dividends. We believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements. In 2010, we expect that cash from operations will be lower due to higher tax payments and working capital requirements. We anticipate base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in 2010 of up to $1.4 billion. The capital needs of our utilities will increase due primarily to renewable and energy optimization related expenditures. We incurred environmental expenditures of approximately $116 million in 2009 and we expect over $2.2 billion of future capital expenditures through 2019 to satisfy both existing and proposed new requirements. We plan to seek regulatory approval to include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment. Capital spending for growth of existing or new non utility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet our strict risk return and value creation criteria. Debt maturing in 2010 totals approximately $661 million. 46 Table of Contents 2009 2008 2007 (in Millions) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash Flow From (Used For) Operating activities: Net income $ 535 $ 553 $ 787 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,020 899 926 Deferred income taxes 205 348 144 Gain on sale of non utility business (128 ) (900 ) Gain on sale of synfuel and other assets, net and synfuel impairment (10 ) (35 ) (253 ) Working capital and other 69 (78 ) 421 1,819 1,559 1,125 Investing activities: Plant and equipment expenditures utility (960 ) (1,183 ) (1,035 ) Plant and equipment expenditures non utility (75 ) (190 ) (264 ) Proceeds from sale of non utility business 253 1,262 Proceeds (refunds) from sale of synfuels and other assets 83 (278 ) 417 Restricted cash and other investments (112 ) (125 ) (50 ) (1,064 ) (1,523 ) 330 Financing activities: Issuance of long term debt 427 1,310 50 Redemption of long term debt (486 ) (446 ) (393 ) Repurchase of long term debt (238 ) Short term borrowings, net (417 ) (340 ) (47 ) Issuance of common stock 35 Repurchase of common stock (16 ) (708 ) Dividends on common stock and other (348 ) (354 ) (370 ) (789 ) (84 ) (1,468 ) Net Decrease in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ (34 ) $ (48 ) $ (13 ) Cash from Operating Activities A majority of our operating cash flow is provided by our electric and gas utilities, which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather, electric Customer Choice, regulatory deferrals, regulatory outcomes, economic conditions and operating costs. Cash from operations totaling $1.8 billion in 2009, increased $260 million from the comparable 2008 period. The operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects lower working capital requirements and higher net income after adjusting for non cash and non operating items (depreciation, depletion and amortization, deferred taxes and gains on sales of assets). Cash from operations totaling $1.6 billion in 2008 increased $434 million from the comparable 2007 period. The operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects higher net income after adjusting for non cash and non operating items (depreciation, depletion and amortization, deferred taxes and gains on sales of assets), and cash payments received related to our synfuel program hedges. 47 Table of Contents Cash from Investing Activities Cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets, while cash outflows are primarily generated from plant and equipment expenditures. In any given year, we will look to realize cash from under performing or non strategic assets or matured fully valued assets. Capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain our generation and distribution infrastructure, comply with environmental regulations and gas pipeline replacements. Capital spending within our non utility businesses is for ongoing maintenance and expansion. The balance of non utility spending is for growth, which we manage very carefully. We look to make investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy, management skills, risks and returns. All new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis. We have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria. For new business lines, we initially invest based on research and analysis. We start with a limited investment, we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results. In any given year, the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the Company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings. Net cash used for investing activities was approximately $1.1 billion in 2009, compared with net cash used for investing activities of $1.5 billion in 2008. The change was primarily driven by reduced capital expenditures by our utility and non utility businesses and the completion of refund payments to our synfuel partners in 2008. Net cash used for investing activities increased $1.9 billion in 2008, due primarily to the sale of our Antrim shale gas exploration and production business in 2007 which offset most of the capital expenditures during that period, and the completion of synfuel partner refunds in 2008. Cash from Financing Activities We rely on both short term borrowing and long term financing as a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied by our operations. Our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity. We continually evaluate our leverage target, which is currently 50% to 52%, to ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating. We have completed a number of refinancings with the effect of extending the average maturity of our long term debt and strengthening our balance sheet. The extension of the average maturity was accomplished at interest rates that lowered our debt costs. Net cash used for financing activities was $789 million in 2009, compared to net cash used for financing activities of approximately $84 million for the same period in 2008. The change was primarily attributable to lower proceeds from the issuance of long term debt. Net cash used for financing activities decreased $1.4 billion in 2008 primarily related to the repurchase of common stock in 2007 and increased issuances of long term debt. Outlook We expect cash flow from operations to increase over the long term primarily as a result of growth from our utilities and the non utility businesses. We expect growth in our utilities to be driven primarily by new and existing state and federal regulations that will result in additional environmental and renewable energy investments which will increase the base from which rates are determined. Our non utility growth is expected from additional investments in energy projects as economic conditions improve. We have been impacted by unfavorable national and regional economic trends that have reduced demand for electricity in our service territory. We may be impacted by the delayed collection of underrecoveries of our PSCR and GCR costs and electric and gas accounts receivable as a result of MPSC orders. Energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of our long term capital projects. 48 Table of Contents In April 2009, we completed an early renewal of $975 million of our syndicated revolving credit facilities before their scheduled expiration in October 2009. The new $1 billion two year facility will expire in 2011 and has similar covenants to the prior facility. A new two year $50 million credit facility was completed in May 2009 and a new one year $70 million credit facility was completed in June 2009. We have a $925 million five year facility that expires in October 2010. We expect to pursue the renewal of that facility before its expiration. Given current conditions in the credit markets, we anticipate that the new facility will be similar to our April 2009 facility with respect to such items as bank participation, allocation levels and covenants. We are evaluating the need to renew our $70 million bi lateral credit facility expiring in June 2010 which is used to support the issuance of letters of credit. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. As a result of losses experienced in the 2008 financial markets, our benefit plan assets experienced negative returns, which have resulted in higher benefit costs and contributions in 2009 and potentially in future years relative to the recent past. During 2009, our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans assets experienced positive returns of approximately 20% and 22%, respectively. During 2010, we expect to contribute up to $200 million to our pension plans and up to $130 million to our postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans. While the impact of continued market volatility and turmoil in the credit markets cannot be predicted, we believe we have sufficient operating flexibility, cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet our future operating cash and capital expenditure needs. However, virtually all of our businesses are capital intensive, or require access to capital, and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows. See Notes 12, 13, and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Contractual Obligations The following table details our contractual obligations for debt redemptions, leases, purchase obligations and other long term obligations as of December 31, 2009: 2015 Contractual Obligations Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 and Beyond (in Millions) Long term debt: Mortgage bonds, notes and other $ 6,768 $ 522 $ 1,118 $ 1,113 $ 4,015 Securitization bonds 933 140 314 374 105 Trust preferred linked securities 289 289 Capital lease obligations 76 14 21 18 23 Interest 5,763 492 822 687 3,762 Operating leases 208 33 54 38 83 Electric, gas, fuel, transportation and storage purchase obligations(1) 4,649 2,513 1,307 158 671 Other long term obligations(2)(3)(4) 298 32 97 33 136 Total obligations $ 18,984 $ 3,746 $ 3,733 $ 2,421 $ 9,084 (1) Excludes amounts associated with full requirements contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required. (2) Includes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $81 million. (3) Excludes other long term liabilities of $181 million not directly derived from contracts or other agreements. (4) At December 31, 2009, we met the minimum pension funding levels required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 for our defined 49 Table of Contents benefit pension plans. We may contribute more than the minimum funding requirements for our pension plans and may also make contributions to our benefit plans and our postretirement benefit plans; however, these amounts are not included in the table above as such amounts are discretionary. Planned funding levels are disclosed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of MDA and in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Credit Ratings Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Management believes that our current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to us may affect our ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. As part of the normal course of business, Detroit Edison, MichCon and various non utility subsidiaries of the Company routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity, natural gas, coal, capacity, storage and other energy related products and services. Certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that the Company post cash or letters of credit in the event that the credit rating of DTE Energy is downgraded below investment grade. Certain of these contracts for Detroit Edison and MichCon contain similar provisions in the event that the credit rating of the particular utility is downgraded below investment grade. The amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial. Also, upon a downgrade below investment grade, we could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if DTE Energy is downgraded below investment grade our non utility businesses, especially the Energy Trading and Power and Industrial Projects segments, could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity. A downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of DTE Energy and its subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets. The impact of a downgrade will not affect our ability to comply with our existing debt covenants. While we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade, we cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews. In May 2009, Standard Poors Rating Group (Standard Poors) revised the outlook on DTE Energy and its subsidiaries to negative from stable, and lowered the short term corporate credit and commercial paper ratings for DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon to A 3 from A 2. The revision was primarily due to concerns over Michigans economic climate. Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) affirmed our existing short term ratings of P 2. In August 2009, Moodys upgraded the majority of senior secured debt ratings of investment grade regulated utilities by one notch as a result of revised notching guidelines between senior secured debt ratings and senior unsecured debt ratings. Both Detroit Edisons and MichCons senior debt ratings were upgraded to A2 from A3. In January 2010, Standard Poors raised its outlook on DTE Energy back to stable and raised the short term credit ratings for DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon back to A 2 from A 3. We have experienced an improvement in our ability to issue commercial paper since the restoration of our short term ratings. Short term borrowings, principally in the form of commercial paper, provide us with the liquidity needed on a daily basis. Our commercial paper program is supported by our unsecured credit facilities. Potential instability in the credit markets and any lowering of ratings may impact future access to the commercial paper markets, which may require us to draw on our back up facilities. 50 Table of Contents The following table shows our credit rating as determined by three nationally recognized credit rating agencies. All ratings are considered investment grade and affect the value of the related securities. Credit Rating Agency Standard Moodys Fitch Entity Description Poors Investors Service Ratings DTE Energy Senior Unsecured Debt BBB Baa2 BBB Commercial Paper A 2 P 2 F2 Detroit Edison Senior Secured Debt A A2 A Commercial Paper A 2 P 2 F2 MichCon Senior Secured Debt BBB+ A2 BBB+ Commercial Paper A 2 P 2 F2 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles require that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Regulation A significant portion of our business is subject to regulation. This results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non regulated businesses. Detroit Edison and MichCon are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non regulated businesses. Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of our businesses. Management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Derivatives and Hedging Activities Derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as Derivative Assets or Liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change, unless the derivative meets certain defined conditions and qualifies as an effective hedge. The normal purchases and normal sales exception requires, among other things, physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. Contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value. Substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by Detroit Edison and MichCon meet the criteria specified for this exception. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market. Fair value is a market based measurement that is determined based on inputs, which 51 Table of Contents refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets and liabilities. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined from a combination of active quotes, published indexes and mathematical valuation models. We generally derive the pricing for our contracts from active quotes or external resources. Actively quoted indexes include exchange traded positions such as the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Intercontinental Exchange, and over the counter positions for which broker quotes are available. For periods in which external market data is not readily observable, we estimate value using mathematical valuation models. Valuation models require various inputs and assumptions, including forward prices, volatility, interest rates, and exercise periods. For those inputs which are not observable, we use model based extrapolation, proxy techniques or historical analysis to derive the required valuation inputs. We periodically update our policy and valuation methodologies for changes in market liquidity and other assumptions which may impact the estimated fair value of our derivative contracts. The fair values we calculate for our derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information. Actual cash returns realized on our derivatives may be different from the results we estimate using models. As fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices, we perform sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our forward contracts. See sensitivity analysis in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See also the Fair Value section, herein. See Notes 4 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses and managements assessment of existing economic conditions, customer trends, and other factors. The allowance for doubtful accounts for our two utilities is calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies and applies these factors to past due receivable balances. As a result of the reduction in past due receivables in 2009, our allowance for doubtful accounts decreased in 2009 compared to an increase in 2008. We believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates. As part of the 2005 gas rate order for MichCon, the MPSC provided for the establishment of an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism that partially mitigates the impact associated with MichCon uncollectible expenses. The MPSC provided for a similar tracking mechanism for Detroit Edison in its rate order received January 2010. However, failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables in light of volatile energy prices and deteriorating economic conditions would unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow. Asset Impairments Goodwill Certain of our reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations. We perform an impairment test for each of our reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired. In performing Step 1 of the impairment test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit, Step 2 of the test would be performed. Step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value, if lower, as of the test date. For Step 1 of the test, we estimate the reporting units fair value using standard valuation techniques, including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit. Such techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes an earnings multiple approach, which incorporates the current market values of comparable entities. These cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance. We also employ market based valuation techniques to test the reasonableness of the indications of value for the reporting units determined under the cash flow technique. We performed our annual impairment test as of October 1, 2009 and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and no impairment existed. We also compared the 52 Table of Contents aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization. The implied premium of the aggregate fair value over market capitalization is likely attributable to factors such as (1) an acquisition control premium (the price in excess of a stocks market price that investors typically pay to gain control of an entity), and (2) the markets apparent discounting of DTE Energys stock price due to ongoing uncertainty regarding the existing regulatory and automotive industry environment and DTE Energys diverse non utility business portfolio. The results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows. As of October 1, 2009 Valuation Date Fair Value Discount Terminal Reporting Unit Goodwill Reduction %(a) Rate Multiple(b) Valuation Methodology(c) ($ in Millions) Electric Utility $ 1,206 16 % 7 % 7.5 x DCF, assuming stock sale Gas Utility 772 8 % 7 % 9.0 x DCF, assuming stock sale Energy Services 28 64 % 13 % 8.5 x DCF, assuming asset sale Coal Services 4 10 % 10 % 7.5 x DCF, assuming asset sale Gas Storage and Pipelines 8 68 % 9 % 8.0 x DCF, assuming asset sale Energy Trading 17 78 % 15 % n/a Blended DCF, economic value of trading portfolio Unconventional Gas Production 2 56 % 13 % n/a Blended DCF, transaction multiples $ 2,037 (a) Percentage by which the fair value of the reporting unit would need to decline to equal its carrying value, including goodwill. (b) Multiple of enterprise value (sum of debt plus equity value) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) (c) Discounted cash flows (DCF) incorporated 2010 2014 projected cash flows plus a calculated terminal value. The Gas Utility reporting unit passed Step 1 of the impairment test by a narrow margin. The narrow excess of fair value over carrying value is largely due to relatively low market values and market multiples of comparable entities referenced in our valuation. Further declines in market multiples, negative regulatory actions or other disruptions in cash flows for the Gas Utility reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the foreseeable future. For example, at the current discount rate and holding all other variables constant, a 0.5x decrease in the terminal multiple would lower the fair value by approximately $130 million. At the lower fair value, the Gas Utility reporting unit would likely fail Step 1 of the test potentially resulting in a charge for impairment of goodwill following completion of the Step 2 analysis. We perform an annual impairment test each October. In between annual tests, we monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows, including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters and will update our impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ from our projections. To the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward, the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill, which would adversely impact our earnings. We monitor DTE Energys stock price in relation to its book value per share. DTEs stock price declined significantly during the first quarter of 2009 and then increased and continued to recover throughout the rest of 2009. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, for a discussion of factors that we considered when assessing triggering events in 2009. 53 Table of Contents Due to the duration and severity of the decline in DTE Energys stock price in the first quarter, we performed an interim impairment test for all reporting units with allocated goodwill as of February 28, 2009. For the first quarter interim test, we updated projected future results, cash flows and discount rates to reflect existing regulatory actions and negative impacts from the deterioration in the regional and national economy. Terminal values that utilize an earnings multiple approach were updated to incorporate the current market values of comparable entities. As compared to the annual test performed in the fourth quarter of 2008, the valuations were negatively impacted by existing market factors with particular downward pressure on market multiples. All reporting units passed Step 1 of the impairment test. We identified a trigger for our Energy Services reporting unit related to long lived asset impairment tests that were performed during the second quarter on certain automotive related project companies. The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value including goodwill, therefore, the reporting unit passed Step 1 of the impairment test. As compared to the first quarter interim test, the second quarter valuation was favorably impacted by increased market multiples and an improved discount rate. Long Lived Assets We evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets, excluding goodwill, when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the long lived assets are deteriorating business climate, condition of the asset, or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life. The review of long lived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected market conditions. An impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of long lived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities. Impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long lived asset is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the long lived asset over its fair value. An impairment would require us to reduce both the long lived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment, which would adversely impact our earnings. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. The Companys Power and Industrial Projects segment has long term contracts with GM to provide onsite energy services at certain of its manufacturing and administrative facilities. The long term contracts provide for full recovery of its investment in the event of early termination. At December 31, 2009, the book value of long lived assets used in the servicing of these facilities was approximately $65 million. Certain of these long lived assets have been funded by non recourse financing totaling approximately $56 million at December 31, 2009. The Companys Power and Industrial Projects segment also has an equity investment of approximately $51 million in an entity which provides onsite services to Chrysler manufacturing facilities. Chryslers performance under the long term contracts for services is guaranteed by Daimler North America Corporation (Daimler), a subsidiary of Daimler AG. The long term contracts and the supporting Daimler guarantee provide for full recovery of the Companys investment in the event of early termination or default. Chrysler has announced the closure of one site that is under a long term service contract with the Company. Through December 31, 2009, to the extent that Chrysler has not been performing in accordance with its contracts, Daimler has been performing under its guarantee. Therefore, the Company believes that it will recover its investment in the event of a facility closure or a Chrysler default. The Company determined that the GM and Chrysler bankruptcy filings were triggering events to assess certain automotive related long lived assets for impairment and as of June 30, 2009, the Company performed an impairment analysis on these assets. Based on its undiscounted cash flow projections and fair value calculations, the Company determined that it did not have an impairment loss at June 30, 2009. We also determined that we did not have an other than temporary decline in our Chrysler related equity investment. There were no new events occurring during the third and fourth quarters that would negatively impact the assumptions made for the second quarter impairment analysis. Therefore, no triggering events were identified during the remainder of 2009. The Companys assumptions and conclusions may change in the future, and we could have an impairment loss if certain facilities are not utilized as currently anticipated. 54 Table of Contents Pension and Postretirement Costs We sponsor defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans for substantially all of the employees of the Company. The measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors, including numerous assumptions and accounting elections. When determining the various assumptions that are required, we consider historical information as well as future expectations. The benefit costs are affected by, among other things, the actual rate of return on plan assets, the long term expected return on plan assets, the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the incidence of mortality, the expected remaining service period of plan participants, level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees. Pension and postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments, some of which are capitalized. We had pension costs for pension plans of $58 million in 2009, $24 million in 2008, and $76 million in 2007. Postretirement benefits costs for all plans were $205 million in 2009, $142 million in 2008 and $188 million in 2007. Pension and postretirement benefits costs for 2009 are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long term rate of return on our plan assets of 8.75%. In developing our expected long term rate of return assumption, we evaluated asset class risk and return expectations, as well as inflation assumptions. Projected returns are based on broad equity, bond and other markets. Our 2010 expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 45% in equity markets, 25% in fixed income markets, and 30% invested in other assets. Because of market volatility, we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate. Given market conditions, we believe that 8.75% is a reasonable long term rate of return on our plan assets for 2010. We will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions, including our expected rate of return, at least annually. We calculate the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the market related value (MRV) of plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year. Current accounting rules provide that the MRV of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years. For our pension plans, we use a calculated value when determining the MRV of the pension plan assets and recognize changes in fair value over a three year period. Accordingly, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. Financial markets in 2009 contributed to our investment performance resulting in unrecognized net gains. As of December 31, 2009, we had $612 million of cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the MRV of pension assets. For our postretirement benefit plans, we use fair value when determining the MRV of postretirement benefit plan assets, therefore all investment losses and gains have been recognized in the calculation of MRV for these plans. The discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency. The yield curve approach matches projected plan pension and postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans. The discount rate determined on this basis decreased from 6.9% at December 31, 2008 to 5.9% at December 31, 2009. We estimate that our 2010 total pension costs will approximate $110 million compared to $58 million in 2009 due to 2008 financial market losses and a decreased discount rate, partially offset by substantial 2009 and planned 2010 contributions coupled with greater than expected 2009 financial market returns. Our 2010 postretirement benefit costs will approximate $167 million compared to $205 million in 2009 primarily due to company specific health care trends and favorable 2009 investment returns, mitigated by a decreased discount rate. Future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design. The pension cost tracking mechanism that provided for recovery or refunding of pension costs above or below amounts reflected in Detroit Edisons base rates, at the request of Detroit Edison, was not reauthorized by the MPSC in its rate order effective 55 Table of Contents January 1, 2009. In April 2005, the MPSC approved the deferral of the non capitalized portion of MichCons negative pension expense. MichCon records a regulatory liability for any negative pension costs, as determined under generally accepted accounting principles. Lowering the expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by one percentage point would have increased our 2009 pension costs by approximately $29 million. Lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased our 2009 pension costs by approximately $15 million. Lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by one percentage point would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2009 by approximately $30 million. In 2008, we changed the measurement date of our pension and postretirement benefit plans from November 30 to December 31. As a result we recognized adjustments of $17 million ($9 million after tax) and $4 million to retained earnings and regulatory liabilities, respectively, which represents approximately one month of pension and other postretirement benefit cost for the period from December 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008. The value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets was $3.4 billion at December 31, 2009 and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009 our pension plans were underfunded by $887 million and our other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by $1.3 billion. The 2009 and 2008 funding levels were generally similar because of positive investment performance returns and plan sponsor contributions in 2009, largely offset by the decreased discount rates. Pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets. We made contributions to our pension plans of $200 million and $100 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Also, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans in January 2010. At the discretion of management, consistent with the Pension Protection Act of 2006, and depending upon financial market conditions, we anticipate making up to an additional $100 million contribution to our pension plans in 2010 and up to $1.1 billion over the next five years. We made postretirement benefit plan contributions of $205 million and $116 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. We are required by orders issued by the MPSC to make postretirement benefit contributions at least equal to the amounts included in Detroit Edisons and MichCons base rates. As a result, we expect to make up to a $130 million contribution to our postretirement plans in 2010 and, subject to MPSC funding requirements, up to $765 million over the next five years. The planned contributions will be made in cash, DTE Energy common stock or a combination of cash and stock. See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Legal Reserves We are involved in various legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters, and establish reserves when appropriate. Legal reserves are based upon managements assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against us. Insured and Uninsured Risks Our comprehensive insurance program provides coverage for various types of risks. Our insurance policies cover risk of loss including property damage, general liability, workers compensation, auto liability, and directors and officers liability. Under our risk management policy, we self insure portions of certain risks up to specified limits, depending on the type of exposure. The maximum self insured retention for various risks is as follows: property damage $10 million, general liability $7 million, workers compensation $9 million, and auto liability $7 million. We have an actuarially determined estimate of our incurred but not reported (IBNR) liability prepared annually and we adjust our reserves for self insured risks as appropriate. As of December 31, 2009, this IBNR liability was approximately $38 million. 56 Table of Contents Accounting for Tax Obligations We are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. We account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two step approach, a more likely than not recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits, no benefit will be recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. We also have non income tax obligations related to property, sales and use and employment related taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters. Accounting for tax obligations requires judgments, including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained, and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. We do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets related to capital losses that we believe will be realized in future periods. We believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 are appropriately accounted. The ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. FAIR VALUE Derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as Derivative Assets or Liabilities. Contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments include power, gas, oil and certain coal forwards, futures, options and swaps, and foreign exchange contracts. Items we do not generally account for as derivatives include proprietary gas inventory, gas storage and transportation arrangements, and gas and oil reserves. See Notes 4 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. As a result of adherence to generally accepted accounting principles, the tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of non derivative gas storage, transportation and power contracts. Consequently, gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods, resulting in volatility in DTE Energys reported period by period earnings; however, the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery and or settlement. The Company manages its mark to market (MTM) risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of its contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract. Accordingly, it records and manages the energy purchase and sale obligations under its contracts in separate components based on the commodity (e.g. electricity or gas), the product (e.g. electricity for delivery during peak or off peak hours), the delivery location (e.g. by region), the risk profile (e.g. forward or option), and the delivery period (e.g. by month and year). The following tables contain the four categories of activities represented by their operating characteristics and key risks: Economic Hedges Represents derivative activity associated with assets owned and contracted by DTE Energy, including forward sales of gas production and trades associated with owned transportation and storage capacity. Changes in the value of derivatives in this category economically offset changes in the value of underlying non derivative positions, which do not qualify for fair value accounting. The difference in accounting treatment of derivatives in this category and the underlying non derivative positions can result in significant earnings volatility. 57 Table of Contents Structured Contracts Represents derivative activity transacted by originating hedged positions with wholesale energy marketers, producers, end users, utilities, retail aggregators and alternative energy suppliers. Substantially all of this activity represents full requirements contracts, whereby the hedged percentage is largely based on estimated load requirements. Proprietary Trading Represents derivative activity transacted with the intent of taking a view, capturing market price changes, or putting capital at risk. This activity is speculative in nature as opposed to hedging an existing exposure. Other Includes derivative activity associated with our Unconventional Gas reserves. A portion of the price risk associated with anticipated production from the Barnett natural gas reserves has been mitigated through 2010. Changes in the value of the hedges are recorded as Derivative assets or liabilities, with an offset in Other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedges are deemed effective. The amounts shown in the following tables exclude the value of the underlying gas reserves including changes therein. Other also includes derivative activity at Detroit Edison related to FTRs and forward contracts related to emissions. Changes in the value of derivative contracts at Detroit Edison are recorded as Derivative assets or liabilities, with an offset to Regulatory assets or liabilities as the settlement value of these contracts will be included in the PSCR mechanism when realized. The following tables provide details on changes in our MTM net asset (or liability) position during 2009: Economic Structured Proprietary Hedges Contracts Trading Other Total (in Millions) MTM at December 31, 2008 $ 18 $ (222 ) $ 22 $ 9 $ (173 ) Reclassify to realized upon settlement (23 ) 98 (198 ) (8 ) (131 ) Changes in fair value recorded to income 9 (32 ) 203 180 Amounts recorded to unrealized income (14 ) 66 5 (8 ) 49 Changes in fair value recorded in regulatory liabilities (16 ) (16 ) Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income, pretax 5 5 Change in collateral held by others 9 21 68 98 Option premiums paid and other 3 (65 ) 6 (56 ) MTM at December 31, 2009 $ 13 $ (132 ) $ 30 $ (4 ) $ (93 ) A substantial portion of the Companys price risk related to its Antrim shale gas exploration and production business was mitigated by financial contracts that hedged our price risk exposure through 2013. The contracts were retained when the Antrim business was sold and offsetting financial contracts were put into place to effectively settle these positions. The contracts will require payments through 2013. These contracts represent a significant portion of the above net mark to market liability. 58 Table of Contents The following table provides a current and noncurrent analysis of Derivative assets and liabilities, as reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2009. Amounts that relate to contracts that become due within twelve months are classified as current and all remaining amounts are classified as noncurrent.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Price Risk DTE Energy has commodity price risk in both utility and non utility businesses arising from market price fluctuations. The Electric and Gas utility businesses have risks in conjunction with the anticipated purchases of coal, natural gas, uranium, electricity, and base metals to meet their service obligations. However, the Company does not bear significant exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in the form of PSCR and GCR regulatory rate recovery mechanisms. In addition, changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost and stolen gas, storage sales revenue and uncollectible expenses at the Gas Utility. Gas Utility manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of long term storage contracts. The Company has tracking mechanisms to mitigate a portion of losses related to uncollectible accounts receivable at MichCon and Detroit Edison. The Company is exposed to short term cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery. Our Gas Storage and Pipelines business segment has limited exposure to natural gas price fluctuations and manages its exposure through the sale of long term storage and transportation contracts. Our Unconventional Gas Production business segment has exposure to natural gas and, to a lesser extent, crude oil price fluctuations. These commodity price fluctuations can impact both current year earnings and reserve valuations. To manage this exposure we may use forward energy and futures contracts. Our Power and Industrial Projects business segment is subject to electricity, natural gas, coal and coal based product price risk and other risks associated with the weakened U.S. economy. To the extent that 59 Table of Contents commodity price risk has not been mitigated through the use of long term contracts, we manage this exposure using forward energy, capacity and futures contracts. Our Energy Trading business segment has exposure to electricity, natural gas, crude oil, heating oil, and foreign exchange price fluctuations. These risks are managed by our energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy, capacity, storage, options and futures contracts, within pre determined risk parameters. Credit Risk Bankruptcies The Company purchases and sells electricity, gas, coal, coke and other energy products from and to numerous companies operating in the steel, automotive, energy, retail, financial and other industries. Certain of its customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Company regularly reviews contingent matters relating to these customers and its purchase and sale contracts and records provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss. The Company believes its accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss. The final resolution of these matters may have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. The Companys utilities and certain non utility businesses provide services to the domestic automotive industry, including GM, Ford Motor Company (Ford) and Chrysler and many of their vendors and suppliers. Chrysler filed for bankruptcy protection on April 30, 2009. We have reserved approximately $9 million of pre petition accounts receivable related to Chrysler as of December 31, 2009. GM filed for bankruptcy protection on June 1, 2009. We have reserved or written off approximately $5 million of pre petition accounts and notes receivable related to GM as of December 31, 2009. Closing of GM or Chrysler plants or other facilities that operate within Detroit Edisons service territory will also negatively impact the Companys operating revenues in future periods. In 2009, GM and Chrysler each represented two percent of our annual electric sales volumes, respectively. GM and Chrysler have an immaterial impact to MichCons revenues. Other We engage in business with customers that are non investment grade. We closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and, when deemed necessary, we request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations. Trading Activities We are exposed to credit risk through trading activities. Credit risk is the potential loss that may result if our trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations. We utilize both external and internally 60 Table of Contents generated credit assessments when determining the credit quality of our trading counterparties. The following table displays the credit quality of our trading counterparties as of December 31, 2009: Credit Exposure Before Cash Cash Net Credit Collateral Collateral Exposure (in Millions) Investment Grade(1) A and Greater $ 254 $ (12 ) $ 242 BBB+ and BBB 177 177 BBB 54 54 Total Investment Grade 485 (12 ) 473 Non investment grade(2) 2 2 Internally Rated investment grade(3) 99 99 Internally Rated non investment grade(4) 10 10 Total $ 596 $ (12 ) $ 584 (1) This category includes counterparties with minimum credit ratings of Baa3 assigned by Moodys Investor Service (Moodys) and BBB assigned by Standard Poors Rating Group (Standard Poors). The five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented approximately 29 percent of the total gross credit exposure. (2) This category includes counterparties with credit ratings that are below investment grade. The five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented less than one percent of the total gross credit exposure. (3) This category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moodys or Standard Poors, but are considered investment grade based on DTE Energys evaluation of the counterpartys creditworthiness. The five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented approximately 14 percent of the total gross credit exposure. (4) This category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moodys or Standard Poors, and are considered non investment grade based on DTE Energys evaluation of the counterpartys creditworthiness. The five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented less than two percent of the total gross credit exposure. Interest Rate Risk DTE Energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt and preferred securities. In order to manage interest costs, we may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements. Our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in U.S. Treasury rates, commercial paper rates and London Inter Bank Offered Rates (LIBOR). As of December 31, 2009, we had a floating rate debt to total debt ratio of approximately five percent (excluding securitized debt). Foreign Exchange Risk The Company has foreign exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts. These contracts are denominated in Canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of power as well as for long term transportation capacity. To limit our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations, we have entered into a series of exchange forward contracts through January 2013. Additionally, we may enter into fair value exchange hedges to mitigate changes in the value of contracts or loans. Summary of Sensitivity Analysis The Company performed a sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our commodity contracts, long term debt obligations and foreign exchange forward contracts.
