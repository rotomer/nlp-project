Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW DTE Energy is a diversified energy company with 2010 operating revenues in excess of $8 billion and approximately $25 billion in assets. We are the parent company of Detroit Edison and MichCon, regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales, distribution and storage services throughout southeastern Michigan. We operate four energy related non utility segments with operations throughout the United States. The following table summarizes our financial results: 2010 2009 2008 (In millions, except per share amounts) Net income attributable to DTE Energy Company $ 630 $ 532 $ 546 Diluted earnings per common share $ 3.74 $ 3.24 $ 3.34 The increase in 2010 Net income attributable to DTE Energy as compared to 2009 was primarily due to improved results in the Electric and Gas Utilities and in the Power and Industrial Projects segment, partially offset by lower earnings in Energy Trading. The decrease in Net income attributable to DTE Energy in 2009 from 2008 was primarily due to an $80 million after tax gain recorded in the Unconventional Gas Production segment on the 2008 sale of a portion of Barnett shale properties, partially offset by higher earnings in the Electric Utility and Energy Trading segments. The items discussed below influenced our current financial performance and or may affect future results: Impacts of national and regional economic conditions; Effects of weather on utility operations; Collectibility of accounts receivable on utility operations; Impact of regulatory decisions on utility operations; Non utility operations; Capital investments, including required renewable, energy efficiency, environmental, reliability related and other costs; and Environmental matters. Reference in this report to we, us, our, Company or DTE are to DTE Energy and its subsidiaries, collectively. UTILITY OPERATIONS Our Electric Utility segment consists of Detroit Edison, which is engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 2.1 million customers in southeastern Michigan. Our Gas Utility segment consists of MichCon and Citizens. MichCon is engaged in the purchase, storage, transportation, gathering, distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 1.2 million customers throughout Michigan. Citizens distributes natural gas in Adrian, Michigan to approximately 17,000 customers. Detroit Edison has experienced decreased electric sales in 2010 driven primarily by a decrease in commercial sales, partially offset by higher residential and industrial sales. Commercial sales continue to be lower due primarily to customers participating in the electric Customer Choice program. The residential sales increase is a result of warmer summer weather. Industrial sales are higher due to increased demand from customers in the automotive and steel industries and their related suppliers and other ancillary businesses. The impact of customers participating in the electric Customer Choice program is mitigated by the CIM, an over/under recovery mechanism which measures non fuel revenues that are lost or gained as a result of fluctuations in electric Customer Choice sales. If annual electric Customer Choice sales exceed the baseline amount from Detroit Edisons most recent rate case, 90 percent 31 Table of Contents of its lost non fuel revenues associated with sales above that level may be recovered from full service customers. If annual electric Customer Choice sales decrease below the baseline, the Company must refund 90 percent of its increase in non fuel revenues associated with sales below that level to full service customers. MichCons sales were lower due primarily to a decrease in the number of customers, reduced natural gas usage by customers due to economic conditions and an increased emphasis on conservation of energy usage. We have RDMs in place at both utilities. The RDMs are designed to minimize the impact on revenues of changes in average customer usage of electricity and natural gas. The January 2010 MPSC order in Detroit Edisons 2009 rate case provided for, among other items, the implementation of a pilot electric RDM effective February 1, 2010. The electric RDM enables Detroit Edison to recover or refund the change in revenue resulting from the difference between actual average sales per customer compared to the base level of average sales per customer established in the MPSC order. The June 2010 MPSC order in MichCons 2009 rate case provided for, among other items, the implementation of a pilot gas RDM effective July 1, 2010. The gas RDM enables MichCon to recover or refund the change in revenue resulting from the difference in weather adjusted average sales per customer compared to the base average sales per customer established in the MPSC order. The RDMs for Detroit Edison and MichCon address changes in customer usage due to general economic conditions and conservation, but do not shield the utilities from the impacts of lost customers. In addition, the pilot electric RDM materially shields Detroit Edison from the impact of weather on customer usage. The pilot gas RDM does not shield MichCon from the impact of weather on customer usage. The electric and gas RDMs are subject to review by the MPSC after the initial one year pilot programs. Both utilities continue to experience high levels of past due receivables primarily attributable to economic conditions. Our service territories continue to experience high levels of unemployment, underemployment and low income households, home foreclosures and a lack of adequate levels of assistance for low income customers. We have taken actions to manage the level of past due receivables, including customer assistance forums, contracting with collection agencies, working with Michigan officials and others to increase the share of low income funding allocated to our customers, and increasing customer disconnections. As a result of actions taken to manage the level of past due receivables, arrears were reduced in 2010 in our electric and gas utilities. Detroit Edison has an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism that enables it to recover or refund 80 percent of the difference between the actual uncollectible expense for each year and the $66 million level reflected in base rates. In the June 2010 MPSC rate order, the base amount of MichCons uncollectible expense tracking mechanism was increased prospectively from $37 million to $70 million and MichCons portion of recovery or refund of the expenses above or below the base amount was modified to 80 percent from 90 percent. The Detroit Edison and MichCon uncollectible tracking mechanisms require annual reconciliation proceedings before the MPSC. 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Uncollectible Expense Detroit Edison $ 58 $ 78 $ 87 MichCon 58 93 126 $ 116 $ 171 $ 213 We are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow at our utility operations through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of our long term capital projects. We are actively managing our cash, capital expenditures, cost structure and liquidity to maintain our financial strength. See the Capital Resources and Liquidity section in this Managements Discussion and Analysis for further discussion of our liquidity outlook. NON UTILITY OPERATIONS We have significant investments in non utility businesses. We employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing opportunities that leverage our assets, skills and expertise. Specifically, we invest in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with our risk profile. We expect growth opportunities in the Gas Storage and Pipelines and Power and Industrial Projects segments in the future. Expansion of these businesses will also result in our ability to further diversify geographically. 32 Table of Contents Gas Storage and Pipelines owns partnership interests in two natural gas storage fields and two interstate pipelines serving the Midwest, Ontario and Northeast markets. Much of the growth in demand for natural gas is expected to occur in the Eastern Canada and the Northeast U.S. regions. Our Vector and Millennium pipelines are well positioned to provide access routes and low cost expansion options to these markets. In addition, Millennium Pipeline is well positioned for growth related to the Marcellus shale, especially with respect to Marcellus production in Northern Pennsylvania and along the southern tier of New York. Our Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in natural gas and oil exploration, development and production primarily within the Barnett shale in north Texas. Our acreage covers an area that produces high Btu gas which provides a significant contribution to revenues from the value of natural gas liquids extracted from the gas stream. During this period of low natural gas prices, these natural gas liquids, with prices correlated to crude oil prices, have provided a significant increase to our realized wellhead price. Our drilling efforts have and will continue to target liquids rich gas and oil producing locations. We continue to develop our holdings and to seek opportunities for additional monetization of select properties, when conditions are appropriate. Power and Industrial Projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and products and services to industrial, commercial and institutional customers; provide coal transportation, marketing and trading services; and sell electricity from biomass fired energy projects. This business segment provides services using project assets usually located on or near the customers premises in the steel, automotive, pulp and paper, airport and other industries. Renewable energy, environmental and economic trends are creating growth opportunities. The increasing number of states with renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency mandates provides the opportunity to market the expertise of the Power and Industrial Projects segment in renewable power generation, landfill gas recovery, reduced emission fuel and other related services. Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from DTE Energys asset portfolio, and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage, and power transmission and generating capacity positions. Energy Trading also provides natural gas, power and ancillary services to various utilities which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf. CAPITAL INVESTMENTS We anticipate significant capital investments during the next three years concentrated primarily in Detroit Edison. 2011 2013 (In billions) Capital Investments Detroit Edison $ 3.4 3.8 MichCon 0.5 0.6 Non Utility 0.6 0.9 $ 4.5 5.3 Our utility businesses require significant capital investments each year in order to maintain and improve the reliability of their asset bases, including power generation plants, distribution systems, storage fields and other facilities and fleets. For both Detroit Edison and MichCon we plan to seek regulatory approval in general rate case filings to include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base consistent with prior general rate case filing treatment. Detroit Edison is required to implement a 20 year renewable energy plan to address the provisions of Michigan Public Act 295 of 2008, with the goals of delivering cleaner renewable electric generation to its customers, further diversifying Detroit Edisons and the State of Michigans sources of electric supply and addressing the state and national goals of increasing energy independence. Detroit Edison will seek separate regulatory approval and recovery of these renewable capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base through our renewable energy plan filings. In April 2010, the Company signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy for a grant of approximately $84 million in matching funds on total anticipated spending of approximately $168 million related to the accelerated deployment of smart grid technology in Michigan through 2012. The smart grid technology includes 33 Table of Contents the establishment of an advanced metering infrastructure and other technologies that address improved electric distribution service. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Non utility investments are expected primarily in continued investment in gas storage and pipeline assets and renewable opportunities in the Power and Industrial Projects businesses. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We are subject to extensive environmental regulation. Additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented. Actual costs to comply could vary substantially. We expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers. Air Detroit Edison is subject to the EPA ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Since 2005, the EPA and the State of Michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate, regional haze and mercury air pollution. The new rules will lead to additional controls on fossil fueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions. To comply with these requirements, Detroit Edison has spent approximately $1.5 billion through 2010. The Company estimates Detroit Edison will make capital expenditures of over $230 million in 2011 and up to $2.1 billion of additional capital expenditures through 2020 based on current regulations. Further, additional rulemakings are expected over the next few years which could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and hazardous air pollutants. It is not possible to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this time. In July 2009, DTE Energy received a Notice of Violation/Finding of Violation (NOV/FOV) from the EPA alleging, among other things, that five Detroit Edison power plants violated New Source Performance standards, Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements, and operating permit requirements under the Clean Air Act. An additional NOV/FOV was received in June 2010 related to a recent project and outage at Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant. On August 5, 2010, the United States Department of Justice, at the request of the EPA, brought a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against DTE Energy and Detroit Edison, related to the June 2010 NOV/FOV and the outage work performed at Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant, but not relating to the July 2009 NOV/FOV. Among other relief, the EPA requested the court to require Detroit Edison to install and operate the best available control technology at Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant. Further, the EPA requested the court to issue a preliminary injunction to require Detroit Edison to (i) begin the process of obtaining the necessary permits for the Monroe Unit 2 modification and (ii) offset the pollution from Monroe Unit 2 through emissions reductions from Detroit Edisons fleet of coal fired power plants until the new control equipment is operating. In January 2011, the EPAs motion for preliminary injunction was denied and the liability phase of the civil suit has been scheduled for trial in May 2011. DTE Energy and Detroit Edison believe that the plants identified by the EPA, including Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant, have complied with all applicable federal environmental regulations. Depending upon the outcome of discussions with the EPA regarding the NOV/FOV and the result of the civil action, the Company could also be required to install additional pollution control equipment at some or all of the power plants in question, implement early retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical, engage in supplemental environmental programs, and or pay fines. The Company cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter, or the timing of its resolution. Water In response to an EPA regulation, Detroit Edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities. Based on the results of completed studies and expected future studies, Detroit Edison may be required to install additional control technologies to reduce the impacts of the water intakes. Initially, it was estimated that Detroit Edison could incur up to approximately $55 million in additional capital expenditures over the four to six years subsequent to 2008 to comply with these requirements. However, a January 2007 circuit court decision remanded back to the EPA several provisions of the federal regulation that has resulted in a delay in compliance dates. The decision also raised the 34 Table of Contents possibility that Detroit Edison may have to install cooling towers at some facilities at a cost substantially greater than was initially estimated for other mitigative technologies. In 2008, the Supreme Court agreed to review the remanded cost benefit analysis provision of the rule and in April 2009 upheld the EPAs use of this provision in determining best technology available for reducing environmental impacts. The EPA continues to develop a revised rule, a draft of which is expected to be published in the first quarter of 2011, with a final rule scheduled for mid 2012. The EPA has also issued an information collection request to begin a review of steam electric effluent guidelines. It is not possible at this time to quantify the impacts of these developing requirements. Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) and Other Sites Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal, coke or oil. The facilities, which produced gas, have been designated as MGP sites. Gas Utility owns, or previously owned, fifteen such former MGP sites. Detroit Edison owns, or previously owned, three former MGP sites. In addition to the MGP sites, we are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations. These other sites include an engineered ash storage facility, electrical distribution substations, gas pipelines, and underground and aboveground storage tank locations. Cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years. Any significant change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect the Companys financial position and cash flows. The Company anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the MPSC for MichCon, which allows MichCon to amortize the MGP costs over a ten year period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the MGP costs were incurred, and the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for Citizens Fuel Gas approved by the City of Adrian, will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations. Landfill Detroit Edison owns and operates a permitted engineered ash storage facility at the Monroe Power Plant to dispose of fly ash from the coal fired power plant. Detroit Edison performed an engineering analysis in 2009 and identified the need for embankment side slope repairs and reconstruction. The EPA has published proposed rules to regulate coal ash under the authority of the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The proposed rule published on June 21, 2010 contains two primary regulatory options to regulate coal ash residue. The EPA is currently considering either, to designate coal ash as a Hazardous Waste as defined by RCRA or to regulate coal ash as non hazardous waste under RCRA. However, agencies and legislatures have urged the EPA to regulate coal ash as a non hazardous waste. If the EPA were to designate coal ash as a hazardous waste, the agency could apply some, or all, of the disposal and reuse standards that have been applied to other existing hazardous wastes. Some of the regulatory actions currently being contemplated could have a significant impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers. It is not possible to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this time. Non Utility The Companys non utility affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants. The Michigan coke battery facility received and responded to information requests from the EPA that resulted in the issuance of a Notice of Violation in June of 2007 alleging potential maximum achievable control technologies and new source review violations. The EPA is in the process of reviewing the Companys position of demonstrated compliance and has not initiated escalated enforcement. At this time, the Company cannot predict the impact of this issue. Furthermore, the Michigan coke battery facility is the subject of an investigation by the MDNRE concerning visible emissions readings that resulted from the Company self reporting to MDNRE questionable activities by an employee of a contractor hired by the Company to perform the visible emissions readings. At this time, the Company cannot predict the impact of this investigation. The Company is also in the process of settling historical air and water violations at its coke battery facility located in Pennsylvania. At this time, the Company cannot predict the impact of this settlement. The Company received two notices of violation from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection in 2010 alleging 35 Table of Contents violations of the permit for the Pennsylvania coke battery facility in connection with coal pile storm water runoff. The Company has implemented best management practices to address this issue and is currently seeking a permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to upgrade its wastewater treatment technology to a biological treatment facility. The Company expects to spend approximately $0.7 million on the existing waste water treatment system to comply with existing water discharge requirements. The Company may spend an additional $13 million over the next few years to meet future regulatory requirements and gain other operational improvements/savings. The Companys non utility affiliates are substantially in compliance with all environmental requirements, other than as noted above. Global Climate Change Climate regulation and or legislation is being proposed and discussed within the U.S. Congress and the EPA. Despite passage of a greenhouse gas cap and trade bill by the U.S. House in June 2009, the Senate has been unable to pass a similar climate bill. A greenhouse gas cap and trade program is not expected to be included in energy or climate bills to be considered by the 112th Congress. Meanwhile, the EPA is beginning to implement regulatory actions under the Clean Air Act to address emission of greenhouse gases. The EPA regulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) begins in 2011 requiring the best available control technology (BACT) for major sources or modifications to existing major sources that cause significant increases in GHG emissions. The impact of this rule is uncertain until BACT is better defined by the permitting agencies. Pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers. Impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned, financing costs related to additional capital expenditures, the purchase of emission offsets from market sources and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical. We would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to our utility customers. Increased costs for energy produced from traditional sources could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable and or nuclear sources and energy efficiency initiatives and the development of market based trading of carbon offsets providing business opportunities for our utility and non utility segments. It is not possible to quantify these impacts on DTE Energy or its customers at this time. OUTLOOK The next few years will be a period of rapid change for DTE Energy and for the energy industry. Our strong utility base, combined with our integrated non utility operations, position us well for long term growth. Looking forward, we will focus on several areas that we expect will improve future performance: improving Electric and Gas Utility customer satisfaction; continuing to pursue regulatory stability and investment recovery for our utilities; managing the growth of our utility asset base; optimizing our cost structure across all business segments; managing cash, capital and liquidity to maintain or improve our financial strength; and investing in businesses that integrate our assets and leverage our skills and expertise. We will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined manner if we can secure opportunities that meet our strategic, financial and risk criteria. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of our segments. 36 Table of Contents 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy by Segment: Electric Utility $ 441 $ 376 $ 331 Gas Utility 127 80 85 Gas Storage and Pipelines 51 49 38 Unconventional Gas Production(1) (11 ) (9 ) 84 Power and Industrial Projects 85 31 40 Energy Trading 6 75 42 Corporate Other (69 ) (70 ) (94 ) Discontinued Operations 20 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company $ 630 $ 532 $ 546 (1) 2008 net income of the Unconventional Gas Production segment resulted principally from the gain on the sale of a portion of our Barnett shale properties See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. ELECTRIC UTILITY Our Electric Utility segment consists of Detroit Edison. Electric Utility results are discussed below: 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Operating Revenues $ 4,993 $ 4,714 $ 4,874 Fuel and Purchased Power 1,580 1,491 1,778 Gross Margin 3,413 3,223 3,096 Operation and Maintenance 1,305 1,277 1,322 Depreciation and Amortization 849 844 743 Taxes Other Than Income 237 205 232 Asset (Gains) Losses, Reserves and Impairments, Net (6 ) (2 ) (1 ) Operating Income 1,028 899 800 Other (Income) and Deductions 317 295 283 Income Tax Provision 270 228 186 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company $ 441 $ 376 $ 331 Operating Income as a Percent of Operating Revenues 21 % 19 % 16 % Gross margin increased $190 million in 2010 and increased $127 million in 2009. Revenues associated with certain tracking mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The following table details changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period: 2010 2009 (In millions) Weather, net of RDM $ 84 $ (66 ) Energy optimization and renewable surcharge/regulatory offset (10 ) 54 Securitization bond and tax surcharge rate increase 40 62 2010 rate order, surcharges and other 76 77 Increase in gross margin $ 190 $ 127 37 Table of Contents 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands of MWh) Electric Sales Residential 15,726 14,625 15,492 Commercial 16,570 18,200 18,920 Industrial 10,195 9,922 13,086 Other 3,210 3,229 3,218 45,701 45,976 50,716 Interconnection sales(1) 4,876 5,156 3,583 Total Electric Sales 50,577 51,132 54,299 Electric Deliveries Retail and Wholesale 45,701 45,976 50,716 Electric Customer Choice, including self generators(2) 5,005 1,477 1,457 Total Electric Sales and Deliveries 50,706 47,453 52,173 (1) Represents power that is not distributed by Detroit Edison.

Operation and maintenance expense increased $28 million in 2010 and decreased $45 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 is primarily due to higher restoration and line clearance expenses of $40 million, higher energy optimization and renewable energy expenses of $18 million, higher legal expenses of $15 million, partially offset by reduced uncollectible expenses of $20 million, lower generation expenses of $18 million and lower employee benefit related expenses of $6 million. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to $71 million from continuous improvement initiatives and other cost reductions resulting in lower contract labor and outside services expense, information technology and other staff expenses, $14 million of lower employee benefit related expenses, lower restoration and line clearance expenses of $12 million, $9 million of reduced uncollectible expenses and $6 million of reduced maintenance activities, partially offset by higher pension and health care costs of $54 million and $14 million of energy optimization and renewable energy expenses. 38 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization expense increased $5 million in 2010 and $101 million in 2009 due primarily to a higher depreciable base and increased amortization of regulatory assets. Taxes other than income were higher by $32 million in 2010 due primarily to a $30 million reduction in property tax expense in 2009 due to refunds received in settlement of appeals of assessments for prior years. Outlook We continue to move forward in our efforts to improve the operating performance and cash flow of Detroit Edison. The 2010 MPSC order provided for an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism which financially assists in mitigating the impacts of economic conditions in our service territory and a revenue decoupling mechanism that addresses changes in average customer usage due to general economic conditions, weather and conservation. These and other tracking mechanisms and surcharges are expected to result in lower earnings volatility. We expect that our planned significant environmental and renewable expenditures will result in earnings growth. Looking forward, we face additional challenges, such as higher levels of capital spending, volatility in prices for coal and other commodities, increased transportation costs, investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs, lower levels of wholesale sales due to contract expirations, and uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change. We expect to continue our continuous improvement efforts to improve productivity and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability. GAS UTILITY Our Gas Utility segment consists of MichCon and Citizens. Gas Utility results are discussed below: 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Operating Revenues $ 1,648 $ 1,788 $ 2,152 Cost of Gas 870 1,057 1,378 Gross Margin 778 731 774 Operation and Maintenance 378 415 464 Depreciation and Amortization 92 107 102 Taxes Other Than Income 55 49 48 Asset (Gains) and Losses, Net (18 ) (26 ) Operating Income 253 178 186 Other (Income) and Deductions 59 59 60 Income Tax Provision 67 39 41 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company $ 127 $ 80 $ 85 Operating Income as a Percent of Operating Revenues 15 % 10 % 9 % Gross margin increased $47 million in 2010 and decreased $43 million in 2009. Revenues associated with certain tracking mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the Consolidated Statement 39 Table of Contents of Operations. The following table details changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period: 2010 2009 (In millions) 2010 self implementation and rate order $ 125 $ Lost and stolen gas 13 (15 ) Midstream transportation and storage revenues (20 ) 22 Uncollectible tracking mechanism (43 ) (28 ) Lower sales volumes (13 ) Weather (23 ) (4 ) Other (5 ) (5 ) Increase (decrease) in gross margin $ 47 $ (43 ) Gas Markets (in Bcf) Gas sales 118 137 148 End user transportation 140 124 123 258 261 271 Intermediate transportation 391 463 438 649 724 709 Operation and maintenance expense decreased $37 million in 2010 and $49 million in 2009. The decrease in 2010 is primarily due to reduced uncollectible expenses of $35 million and the deferral of $32 million of previously expensed CTA restructuring expenses, partially offset by higher maintenance expenses of $11 million, increased energy optimization expenses of $9 million, higher employee benefit related expenses of $3 million and expense of $3 million for contributions to the Low Income Energy Efficiency Fund. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to $33 million of reduced uncollectible expenses, $15 million of lower employee benefit related expenses, $14 million from continuous improvement initiatives and other cost reductions resulting in lower contract labor and outside services expense, information technology and other staff expenses, partially offset by higher health care expenses of $8 million and $4 million of energy optimization expenses. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $15 million in 2010 due to the March 2010 MPSC order that reduced MichCons depreciation rates effective April 1, 2010. Asset (gains) losses, net decreased $18 million due to 2009 gains on the sale of base gas and the sale of certain gathering and processing assets. Outlook We continue to move forward in our efforts to improve the operating performance and cash flow of Gas Utility. Unfavorable economic trends have resulted in a decrease in the number of customers in our service territory, increased customer conservation and continued high levels of theft and uncollectible accounts receivable. The MPSC has provided for an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism which assists in mitigating the impacts of economic conditions in our service territory and a revenue decoupling mechanism that addresses changes in average customer usage due to general economic conditions and conservation. These and other tracking mechanisms and surcharges are expected to result in lower earnings volatility in the future. Looking forward, we face additional issues, such as volatility in gas prices, investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs. We expect to continue an intense focus on our continuous improvement efforts to improve productivity, minimize lost and stolen gas, and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability. 40 Table of Contents GAS STORAGE AND PIPELINES Our Gas Storage and Pipelines segment consists of our non utility gas pipelines and storage businesses. Gas Storage and Pipelines results are discussed below: 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Operating Revenues $ 83 $ 82 $ 71 Operation and Maintenance 14 15 12 Depreciation and Amortization 5 5 5 Taxes Other Than Income 2 2 3 Asset (Gains) and Losses, Net 1 Operating Income 62 60 50 Other (Income) and Deductions (25 ) (23 ) (12 ) Income Tax Provision 32 33 24 Net Income 55 50 38 Noncontrolling interest 4 1 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy $ 51 $ 49 $ 38 Net income attributable to DTE Energy increased $2 million and $11 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2010 increase was driven by higher gas storage revenues and lower project development costs. The 2009 increase was driven by higher operating revenues resulting from increased capacity sold and higher rates from renewing storage contracts related to long term agreements. In addition, in 2009 we had higher equity earnings from our investments in the Vector and Millennium Pipelines, reflecting a first full year of operations for Millennium. Outlook Our Gas Storage and Pipelines business expects to continue its steady growth plan and is evaluating new pipeline and storage investment opportunities. UNCONVENTIONAL GAS PRODUCTION Our Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in natural gas and oil exploration, development and production within the Barnett shale in northern Texas. In January 2008, we sold a portion of our Barnett shale properties for gross proceeds of approximately $260 million. We recognized a gain of $128 million ($80 million after tax) on the sale in 2008. Unconventional Gas Production results are discussed below: 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Operating Revenues $ 32 $ 31 $ 48 Operation and Maintenance 16 15 22 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 15 16 12 Taxes Other Than Income 2 1 1 Asset (Gains) and Losses, Net 10 6 (120 ) Operating Income (Loss) (11 ) (7 ) 133 Other (Income) and Deductions 6 6 2 Income Tax Provision (Benefit) (6 ) (4 ) 47 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to DTE Energy Company $ (11 ) $ (9 ) $ 84 41 Table of Contents Operating revenues increased $1 million in 2010 as a result of higher commodity prices, and an increase in oil production. The 2009 decrease of $17 million was due to lower commodity prices realized for physical sales as well as a reduction in volumes hedged. Operation and maintenance expense increased $1 million in 2010 due to more wells on line and increased water handling cost. The decrease of $7 million in 2009 was due to operational efficiencies and lower costs for goods and services due to economic conditions. Asset (gains) and losses, net increased $4 million in 2010 and decreased $126 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 was due to impairment of unproved leasehold positions that the Company does not intend to drill prior to expiration. The 2009 decrease was due to the gain of $128 million ($80 million after tax) on the 2008 sale of a portion of our Barnett shale properties and $2 million lower impairment in 2009 of expired or expiring leasehold positions that the Company did not intend to drill at then current commodity prices. Outlook In the longer term, we plan to continue to develop our holdings in the western portion of the Barnett shale and to seek opportunities for additional monetization of select properties when conditions are appropriate. Our strategy for 2011 is to maintain our focus on reducing operating expenses and optimizing production volume. Given the current outlook of low natural gas prices, drilling efforts will continue to target liquids rich gas and oil production. During 2011, we expect total capital investment of $25 million to drill approximately 20 new wells and continue to acquire select acreage and achieve production of approximately 6 Bcfe of natural gas, compared with 5 Bcfe in 2010. POWER AND INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS Power and Industrial Projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utility type products and services to industrial, commercial and institutional customers; provide coal transportation services and marketing; and sell electricity from biomass fired energy projects. Power and Industrial Projects results are discussed below: 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Operating Revenues $ 1,144 $ 661 $ 987 Operation and Maintenance 978 593 899 Depreciation and Amortization 60 40 34 Taxes other than Income 14 9 12 Other Asset (Gains) and Losses, Reserves and Impairments, Net (14 ) (6 ) 6 Operating Income 106 25 36 Other (Income) and Deductions 13 (1 ) (20 ) Income Taxes Provision 36 5 18 Production Tax Credits (33 ) (12 ) (7 ) 3 (7 ) 11 Net Income 90 33 45 Noncontrolling interest 5 2 5 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company $ 85 $ 31 $ 40 VIEs As discussed in Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective January 1, 2010, we adopted the provisions of ASU 2009 17, Amendments to FASB Interpretation 46(R). ASU 2009 17 changed the methodology for determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE from a quantitative risk and rewards based model to a qualitative determination. The Company re evaluated prior VIE and primary beneficiary determinations and, as a result, began consolidating five entities. Since these entities were previously accounted for under the equity method, the VIE consolidation had no impact on Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy. As a 42 Table of Contents result of the consolidation of these VIEs, Operating Revenues and Operations and Maintenance expense increased $174 million and $122 million, respectively, in 2010. Operating revenues increased $309 million, net of VIE adjustments, in 2010 and decreased $326 million in 2009. The 2010 increase is attributed primarily to $172 million of higher coke sales and a $156 million increase in on site services, partially offset by a $18 million decrease in coal trading and transportation services. The 2009 decrease is due primarily to $111 million reduction in certain coal structured transactions, $176 million of lower pricing and volumes of coal and emissions and $84 million of lower coke demand, partially offset by a $107 million increase in coal related services. Operation and maintenance expense increased $262 million, net of VIE adjustments, in 2010 and decreased $306 million in 2009. The increase is due primarily to $118 million of higher coke production and a $154 million increase in on site services, partially offset by $10 million of lower coal trading and transportation services. The 2009 decrease is due primarily to $111 million decrease in certain coal structured transactions and $64 million of lower coke demand, $141 million of lower pricing and volumes of coal and emissions and operating expenses, partially offset by $75 million of higher coal related services. Asset (Gains) Losses were higher by $8 million in 2010 due primarily to the sale of DTE Rail Services and an increase in installment gains from the sale of a coke battery. Other (income) and deductions were lower by $14 million in 2010 and lower by $19 million in 2009. The decreases in both years were due primarily to lower equity earnings in various projects and higher intercompany interest associated with project investment. Outlook We expect sustained production levels of metallurgical coke and pulverized coal supplied to steel industry customers for 2011. Beginning in 2011, substantially all of the metallurgical coke is under long term contracts. The tax credits associated with our steel industry fuels facilities expired at December 31, 2010 that will result in lower tax credits of approximately $29 million in 2011. We supply on site energy services to the domestic automotive manufacturers who have also experienced stabilized demand for automobiles. Our on site energy services will continue to be delivered in accordance with the terms of long term contracts. In late 2009, we began operating reduced emission fuel facilities located at Detroit Edison owned coal fired power plants. The facilities reduce Nitrogen Oxide (NO) and Mercury (Hg) emissions and qualify for production tax credits when the fuel is sold to an unrelated party through 2019. We continue to optimize these facilities by seeking investors for facilities operating at Detroit Edison sites and intend to relocate other facilities to alternative sites which may provide increased production and emission reduction opportunities in 2011 and future years. In January 2011, the Company entered into an agreement to sell a membership interest in one of these reduced emission fuel facilities that is located at a Detroit Edison site. Environmental and economic trends are creating growth opportunities for renewable power. The increasing number of states with renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency mandates provides investment opportunity in waste wood power generation. In addition to the three facilities in operation, we will convert and place into service two additional facilities in 2011 and 2013. We will continue to look for additional investment opportunities for waste wood renewable power generation and other energy projects at favorable prices. Effective January 1, 2011, our existing long term rail transportation contract, at rates significantly below the current market, expired and we anticipate a decrease in transportation related revenue of approximately $130 million as a result. The decrease in revenue will be mostly offset by lower variable costs incurred to provide the transportation. We will continue to work with suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and competitive access to coal to meet the energy requirements of our customers. Power and Industrial Projects will continue to leverage its extensive energy related operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers. ENERGY TRADING Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from DTE Energys asset portfolio, and optimization of contracted natural gas 43 Table of Contents pipeline transportation and storage, and power transmission and generating capacity positions. Energy Trading also provides natural gas, power and ancillary services to various utilities which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf. Energy Trading results are discussed below: 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Operating Revenues $ 875 $ 804 $ 1,388 Fuel, Purchased Power and Gas 786 603 1,235 Gross Margin 89 201 153 Operation and Maintenance 59 71 68 Depreciation and Amortization 5 5 5 Taxes Other Than Income 2 3 2 Operating Income 23 122 78 Other (Income) and Deductions 12 10 5 Income Tax Provision (Benefit) 5 37 31 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company $ 6 $ 75 $ 42 Gross margin decreased $112 million in 2010 and increased $48 million in 2009. The overall decrease in gross margin in 2010 was the result of lower economic performance, lower commodity prices, lower volatility in the markets we participate in and lower risk positions relative to 2009, coupled with the absence of prior year timing related gains. We experienced timing related earnings volatility based on market movement related to derivative contracts. The decrease in 2010 represents a $78 million decrease in realized margins and $34 million decrease in unrealized margins. The $78 million decrease in realized margins is due to $108 million of unfavorable results, primarily in our power and gas trading and gas full requirements strategies, offset by $30 million of favorable results, primarily in our power full requirements and power origination strategies. The $34 million decrease in unrealized margins is due to $56 million of unfavorable results, primarily in our power trading strategy and the absence of prior year timing related gains related to our gas transportation strategy. These decreases were offset by $22 million of favorable results, primarily due to timing related gains in our gas full requirements strategy. The $48 million increase in gross margin in 2009 was due to increases in realized margins of $69 million, offset by decreases in unrealized margins of $21 million. The $69 million increase in realized margins was primarily the result of increases in our gas trading strategy and timing related increases in our gas storage and gas transportation strategies. The $21 million decrease in unrealized margins consisted of unfavorable results of $58 million from our gas trading and gas storage strategies, partially offset by increases of $29 million primarily in our power trading strategy and timing related improvements of $8 million in our oil strategies. Operation and maintenance expense decreased $12 million in 2010 and increased $3 million in 2009. The 2010 decrease was primarily due to lower incentive costs. The 2009 increase was due to higher payroll and incentive costs and commissions, partially offset by lower contractor expense and allocated corporate costs. Income tax provision decreased $32 million in 2010. This decrease is due to lower pretax income, partially offset by $10 million of favorable tax related adjustments in 2009 resulting from the settlement of federal income tax audits. Income taxes were higher by $6 million in 2009 due to higher pretax income, partially offset by the $10 million of favorable tax related adjustments. Outlook In the near term, we expect market conditions to remain challenging and the profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility or lack thereof in commodity prices in the markets we participate in and the uncertainty of impacts associated with financial reform, regulatory changes and changes in operating rules of regional transmission organizations. 44 Table of Contents The Energy Trading portfolio includes financial instruments, physical commodity contracts and gas inventory, as well as contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage, and power transmission and generation capacity positions. Energy Trading also provides natural gas, power and ancillary services to various utilities which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf. Significant portions of the Energy Trading portfolio are economically hedged. Most financial instruments and physical power and gas contracts are deemed derivatives, whereas natural gas inventory, power transmission, pipeline transportation and certain storage assets are not derivatives. As a result, we will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to market without revaluing the underlying non derivative contracts and assets. Our strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying non derivative contracts and assets with futures, forwards, swaps and options. This results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods. See also the Fair Value section that follows. CORPORATE OTHER Corporate Other includes various holding company activities and holds certain non utility debt and energy related investments. The 2010 net loss of $69 million was an improvement of $1 million from the 2009 net loss of $70 million. The net $1 million improvement was a result of the 2009 donation to the DTE Energy Foundation of $10 million and lower impairments of investments of $3 million, partially offset by higher state and local taxes of $3 million, higher tax related interest of $5 million, increased financing costs of $5 million. The 2010 donation to the DTE Energy Foundation of $14 million was made by Detroit Edison and MichCon. The 2009 net loss of $70 million decreased from the net loss of $94 million in 2008 due to $34 million favorable tax related adjustments primarily resulting from the settlement of federal income tax audits, $10 million lower inter company interest expense and $9 million lower costs related to natural gas forward contracts associated with the 2007 sale of the Antrim Shale properties. These favorable variances were partially offset by a $10 million donation of cash and available for sale securities to the DTE Energy Foundation, $10 million resulting from a realignment of employee benefit expense from MichCon, $7 million increase in financing fees, $1 million increased impairment of investments and a $1 million decrease in interest income. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted ASC 820 (SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements). The cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption of ASC 820 represented a $4 million increase to the January 1, 2008 balance of retained earnings. See also the Fair Value section. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Requirements We use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our non utility businesses, retire and pay interest on long term debt and pay dividends. We believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements. In 2011, we expect that cash from operations will be $1.9 billion due to lower working capital requirements. We anticipate base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in 2011 of up to $1.4 billion. The capital needs of our utilities will increase due primarily to environmental expenditures. We plan to seek regulatory approval to include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment. Capital spending for growth of 45 Table of Contents existing or new non utility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet our strict risk return and value creation criteria. 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash Flow From (Used For) Operating activities: Net income $ 639 $ 535 $ 553 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,027 1,020 899 Deferred income taxes 457 205 348 Gain on sale of non utility business (128 ) Gain on sale of synfuel and other assets, net and synfuel impairment (5 ) (10 ) (35 ) Working capital and other (293 ) 69 (78 ) 1,825 1,819 1,559 Investing activities: Plant and equipment expenditures utility (1,011 ) (960 ) (1,183 ) Plant and equipment expenditures non utility (88 ) (75 ) (190 ) Proceeds from sale of non utility business 253 Proceeds (refunds) from sale of synfuels and other assets 56 83 (278 ) Restricted cash and other investments (183 ) (112 ) (125 ) (1,226 ) (1,064 ) (1,523 ) Financing activities: Issuance of long term debt 614 427 1,310 Redemption of long term debt (663 ) (486 ) (446 ) Repurchase of long term debt (238 ) Short term borrowings, net (177 ) (417 ) (340 ) Issuance of common stock 36 35 Repurchase of common stock (16 ) Dividends on common stock and other (396 ) (348 ) (354 ) (586 ) (789 ) (84 ) Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 13 $ (34 ) $ (48 ) Cash from Operating Activities A majority of our operating cash flow is provided by our electric and gas utilities, which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather, electric Customer Choice, regulatory deferrals, regulatory outcomes, economic conditions and operating costs. Cash from operations totaling $1.8 billion in 2010 was consistent with the comparable 2009 period. The operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects higher net income after adjusting for non cash and non operating items (depreciation, depletion and amortization, deferred income taxes and gains on sales of assets), offset by higher working capital requirements. Cash from operations totaling $1.8 billion in 2009, increased $260 million from the comparable 2008 period. The operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects lower working capital requirements and higher net income after adjusting for non cash and non operating items (depreciation, depletion and amortization, deferred income taxes and gains on sales of assets). Cash from Investing Activities Cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets, while cash outflows are primarily generated from plant and equipment expenditures. In any given year, we will look to realize 46 Table of Contents cash from under performing or non strategic assets or matured fully valued assets. Capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain our generation and distribution infrastructure, comply with environmental regulations and gas pipeline replacements. Capital spending within our non utility businesses is for ongoing maintenance and expansion. The balance of non utility spending is for growth, which we manage very carefully. We look to make investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy, management skills, risks and returns. All new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis. We have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria. For new business lines, we initially invest based on research and analysis. We start with a limited investment, we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results. In any given year, the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the Company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings. Net cash used for investing activities was approximately $1.2 billion in 2010, compared with net cash used for investing activities of $1.1 billion in 2009. The change was primarily driven by increased capital expenditures by our utility and non utility businesses. Net cash used for investing activities was approximately $1.1 billion in 2009, compared with net cash used for investing activities of $1.5 billion in 2008. The change was primarily driven by reduced capital expenditures by our utility and non utility businesses and the completion of refund payments to our synfuel partners in 2008. Cash from Financing Activities We rely on both short term borrowing and long term financing as a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied by our operations. Our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity. We continually evaluate our leverage target, which is currently 50% to 52%, to ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating. Net cash used for financing activities was $586 million in 2010, compared to net cash used for financing activities of approximately $789 million for the same period in 2009. The change was primarily attributable to decreased payments for short term borrowings. Increases in issuances of long term debt were offset by increased long term debt redemptions. Net cash used for financing activities was $789 million in 2009, compared to net cash used for financing activities of approximately $84 million for the same period in 2008. The change was primarily attributable to lower proceeds from the issuance of long term debt. Outlook We expect cash flow from operations to increase over the long term primarily as a result of growth from our utilities and the non utility businesses. We expect growth in our utilities to be driven primarily by new and existing state and federal regulations that will result in additional environmental and renewable energy investments which will increase the base from which rates are determined. Our non utility growth is expected from additional investments in energy projects as economic conditions improve. We may be impacted by the delayed collection of underrecoveries of our various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of MPSC orders. Energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of our long term capital projects. We have approximately $900 million in long term debt maturing in the next twelve months. DTE Energy has $600 million of unsecured debt maturing in June 2011 which is expected to be funded through a combination of internally generated funds and short term debt. Substantially all of the remaining debt maturities relate to Securitization and other Detroit Edison issues. The repayment of the principal amount of the Securitization debt is 47 Table of Contents funded through a surcharge payable by Detroit Edisons electric customers. The repayment of the other Detroit Edison debt is expected to be refinanced with long term debt. In August 2010, DTE Energy and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Detroit Edison and MichCon, entered into amended and restated two year $1 billion unsecured revolving credit agreements and new three year $800 million unsecured revolving credit agreements with a syndicate of 23 banks that may be used for general corporate borrowings, but are intended to provide liquidity support for each of the companies commercial paper programs. No one bank provides more than 8.25% of the commitment in any facility. Borrowings under the facilities are available at prevailing short term interest rates. DTE Energy has approximately $1.7 billion of available liquidity at December 31, 2010. In March 2010, the PPACA and the HCERA were enacted into law (collectively, the Act). The Act is a comprehensive health care reform bill. A provision of the PPACA repeals the current rule permitting deduction of the portion of the drug coverage expense that is offset by the Medicare Part D subsidy, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012. We have initiated changes in benefit design and delivery and are continuing to evaluate alternatives to minimize the impact of the legislation. We contributed $200 million to our pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2010, including a DTE Energy stock contribution of $100 million in March 2010. We contributed $160 million to our postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans during the year ended December 31, 2010, including a transfer of $25 million from the MichCon Grantor Trust. In January 2011, we contributed $200 million to our pension plans. Also, we contributed $81 million to our postretirement medical and life insurance plans in January 2011, and we expect to contribute up to an additional $90 million throughout the remainder of 2011. In July 2010, a federal financial reform act was signed into law. The legislation reshapes financial regulation and is intended to address specific issues that contributed to the financial crisis. Most major areas of the legislation will be dependent upon regulatory interpretation, rulemaking and implementation. We do not expect any material effect on our operations and financial position. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 provided for a special allowance for bonus depreciation in 2011 and 2012. Bonus depreciation is accelerated depreciation on certain types of business equipment that allows a tax deduction of either 50% or 100% of the cost of qualifying property in the year the asset is placed in service. DTE Energy expects to generate approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash in 2011 2012 from bonus depreciation deductions, a significant portion of which is expected to result from Detroit Edison property, plant and equipment expenditures during the qualifying period. The cash benefit is an acceleration of tax deductions that the Company would otherwise have received over 20 years. We believe we have sufficient operating flexibility, cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet our future operating cash and capital expenditure needs. However, virtually all of our businesses are capital intensive, or require access to capital, and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows. See Notes 12, 16, 18, and 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. 48 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table details our contractual obligations for debt redemptions, leases, purchase obligations and other long term obligations as of December 31, 2010: 2016 Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 and Beyond (In millions) Long term debt: Mortgage bonds, notes and other $ 6,888 $ 765 $ 691 $ 1,036 $ 4,396 Securitization bonds 793 150 341 302 Trust preferred linked securities 289 289 Capital lease obligations 62 12 18 18 14 Interest 5,547 457 814 649 3,627 Operating leases 211 39 58 40 74 Electric, gas, fuel, transportation and storage purchase obligations(1) 5,921 2,175 1,670 744 1,332 Other long term obligations(2)(3)(4) 243 49 44 31 119 Total obligations $ 19,954 $ 3,647 $ 3,636 $ 2,820 $ 9,851 (1) Excludes amounts associated with full requirements contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required. (2) Includes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $28 million. (3) Excludes other long term liabilities of $184 million not directly derived from contracts or other agreements. (4) At December 31, 2010, we met the minimum pension funding levels required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 for our defined benefit pension plans. We may contribute more than the minimum funding requirements for our pension plans and may also make contributions to our benefit plans and our postretirement benefit plans; however, these amounts are not included in the table above as such amounts are discretionary. Planned funding levels are disclosed in the Capital Resources and Liquidity and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of MDA and in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Credit Ratings Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The Companys credit ratings affect our cost of capital and other terms of financing as well as our ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets. Management believes that our current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to us may affect our ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. As part of the normal course of business, Detroit Edison, MichCon and various non utility subsidiaries of the Company routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity, natural gas, coal, capacity, storage and other energy related products and services. Certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that the Company post cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of DTE Energy is downgraded below investment grade. Certain of these contracts for Detroit Edison and MichCon contain similar provisions in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of the particular utility is downgraded below investment grade. The amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial. Also, upon a downgrade below investment grade, we could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if DTE Energy is downgraded below investment grade our non utility businesses, especially the Energy Trading and Power and Industrial Projects segments, could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity. A downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of DTE 49 Table of Contents Energy and its subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets. The impact of a downgrade will not affect our ability to comply with our existing debt covenants. While we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade, we cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews. In January 2010, Standard Poors Rating Group (Standard Poors) revised the outlook on DTE Energy and its subsidiaries to stable from negative, and raised the short term corporate credit and commercial paper ratings for DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon to A 2 from A 3. The revision was primarily due to the diminished possibility of a downgrade in light of the Companys decreasing regulatory risk. We have experienced an improvement in our ability to issue commercial paper since the restoration of our short term ratings. Short term borrowings, principally in the form of commercial paper, provide us with the liquidity needed on a daily basis. Our commercial paper program is supported by our unsecured credit facilities. Potential instability in the credit markets and any lowering of ratings may impact future access to the commercial paper markets, which may require us to draw on our back up facilities. In June 2010, Standard Poors revised the outlook on DTE Energy and its subsidiaries to positive from stable. The outlook revision reflected the Companys decreasing regulatory risk. In December 2010, Standard and Poors upgraded the corporate credit rating of DTE Energy and its utility subsidiaries to BBB+ from BBB to reflect the companys decreasing regulatory risk and improved financial measures. At the same time, Standard and Poors raised the rating on Detroit Edisons senior secured debt to A from A and raised the rating on MichCons senior secured debt to A from BBB+. In January 2011, Fitch Ratings revised the rating outlook for Detroit Edison to positive from stable due to improvement in its credit protection measures as a result of supportive regulatory policies in Michigan. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles require that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Regulation A significant portion of our business is subject to regulation. This results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non regulated businesses. Detroit Edison and MichCon are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non regulated businesses. Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of our businesses. Management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment. In March 2010, the PPACA and the HCERA were enacted into law (collectively, the Act). A provision of the PPACA repeals the current rule permitting deduction of the portion of the drug coverage expense that is offset by the Medicare Part D subsidy, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012. This change in tax law required a remeasurement of the deferred tax asset related to the Other Postretirement Benefit Obligation (OPEB) and the deferred tax liability related to the OPEB Regulatory Asset. Income tax accounting rules require the impact of a change in tax law be recognized in continuing operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period that the tax law change is enacted. However, regulated businesses may defer changes in tax law if allowed by regulators. The MPSCs historical practice has been to recognize both the expense and working capital impacts for OPEB costs. In addition, the current and deferred tax effects related to OPEB costs have been recognized consistently. The effects of the subsidy have been reflected through lower tax expense included in rates. We believe we have reasonable assurance that the impacts related to the enactment of the Act are recoverable through rates in future periods. Therefore, the amounts related to Detroit Edison of $18 million and MichCon of $4 million have been deferred as Regulatory Assets. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. 50 Table of Contents Derivatives and Hedging Activities Derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as Derivative Assets or Liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change, unless the derivative meets certain defined conditions and qualifies as an effective hedge. The normal purchases and normal sales exception requires, among other things, physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. Contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value. Substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by Detroit Edison and MichCon meet the criteria specified for this exception. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market. Fair value is a market based measurement that is determined based on inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets and liabilities. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs. Management makes certain assumptions it believes that market participants would use in pricing assets and liabilities, including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques. Credit risk of the Company and our counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of the assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves, the impact of which was immaterial at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Management believes it uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market based inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The fair values we calculate for our derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information. Actual cash returns realized on our derivatives may be different from the results we estimate using models. As fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices, we perform sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our forward contracts. See sensitivity analysis in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See also the Fair Value section, herein. See Notes 4 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses and managements assessment of existing economic conditions, customer trends, and other factors. The allowance for doubtful accounts for our two utilities is calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies and applies these factors to past due receivable balances. As a result of the reduction in past due receivables in 2010, our allowance for doubtful accounts decreased significantly from the 2009 balance. We believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates. As part of the 2005 gas rate order for MichCon, the MPSC provided for the establishment of an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism that partially mitigates the impact associated with MichCon uncollectible expenses. The MPSC provided for a similar tracking mechanism for Detroit Edison in its rate order received January 2010. Detroit Edison filed for the suspension of the tracking mechanism effective with the order in its pending rate case. Asset Impairments Goodwill Certain of our reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations. We perform an impairment test for each of our reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired. In performing Step 1 of the impairment test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit, Step 2 of the test would be performed. Step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value, if lower, as of the test date. For Step 1 of the test, we estimate the reporting units fair value using standard valuation techniques, including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit. Such techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes an earnings multiple approach, which incorporates the current market values of comparable entities. These cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require 51 Table of Contents broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance. We also employ market based valuation techniques to test the reasonableness of the indications of value for the reporting units determined under the cash flow technique. We performed our annual impairment test as of October 1, 2010 and determined that except for the Coal Services reporting unit, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and no impairment existed. The $4 million of goodwill attributable to the Coal Services reporting unit was written off in the fourth quarter of 2010 in connection with the sale of rail services assets. We also compared the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization. The implied premium of the aggregate fair value over market capitalization is likely attributable to an acquisition control premium (the price in excess of a stocks market price that investors typically pay to gain control of an entity). The results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows. As of October 1, 2010 Valuation Date Fair Value Discount Terminal Reporting Unit Goodwill Reduction %(a) Rate Multiple(b) Valuation Methodology(c) ($ in millions) Electric Utility $ 1,206 26 % 7 % 8.0 x DCF, assuming stock sale Gas Utility 759 7 % 7 % 9.5 x DCF, assuming stock sale Energy Services 28 66 % 13 % 9.0 x DCF, assuming asset sale(d) Coal Services 4 (e) n/a 12 % 8.5 x DCF, assuming asset sale Gas Storage and Pipelines 8 66 % 10 % 8.0 x DCF, assuming asset sale Energy Trading 17 74 % 15 % n/a Blended DCF, economic value of trading portfolio Unconventional Gas Production 2 62 % 13 % n/a Blended DCF, transaction multiples $ 2,024 (a) Percentage by which the fair value of the reporting unit would need to decline to equal its carrying value, including goodwill. (b) Multiple of enterprise value (sum of debt plus equity value) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA.) (c) Discounted cash flows (DCF) incorporated 2011 2015 projected cash flows plus a calculated terminal value. (d) Asset sales were assumed except for Energy Services reduced emissions fuel projects, which assumed stock sales. (e) Goodwill attributable to Coal Services was written off in connection with the sale of rail services assets. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. The Gas Utility reporting unit passed Step 1 of the impairment test by a 7% margin. A substantive decrease in market multiples, negative regulatory actions or other disruptions in cash flows for the Gas Utility reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the foreseeable future. For example, at the current discount rate and holding all other variables constant, a 0.5x decrease in the terminal multiple would lower the fair value by approximately $130 million. At the lower fair value, the Gas Utility reporting unit would likely fail Step 1 of the test potentially resulting in a charge for impairment of goodwill following completion of the Step 2 analysis. We perform an annual impairment test each October. In between annual tests, we monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows, including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters and will update our impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ from our projections. To the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward, the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill, which would adversely impact our earnings. 52 Table of Contents Long Lived Assets We evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets, excluding goodwill, when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the long lived assets are deteriorating business climate, condition of the asset, or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life. The review of long lived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected market conditions. An impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of long lived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities. Impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long lived asset is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the long lived asset over its fair value. An impairment would require us to reduce both the long lived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment, which would adversely impact our earnings. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Pension and Postretirement Costs We sponsor defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans for substantially all of the employees of the Company. The measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors, including numerous assumptions and accounting elections. When determining the various assumptions that are required, we consider historical information as well as future expectations. The benefit costs are affected by, among other things, the actual rate of return on plan assets, the long term expected return on plan assets, the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the incidence of mortality, the expected remaining service period of plan participants, level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees. Pension and postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments, some of which are capitalized. We had pension costs for pension plans of $112 million in 2010, $58 million in 2009, and $24 million in 2008. Postretirement benefits costs for all plans were $164 million in 2010, $205 million in 2009 and $142 million in 2008. Pension and postretirement benefits costs for 2010 are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long term rate of return on our plan assets of 8.75%. In developing our expected long term rate of return assumptions, we evaluated asset class risk and return expectations, as well as inflation assumptions. Projected returns are based on broad equity, bond and other markets. Our 2011 expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 47% in equity markets, 25% in fixed income markets, and 28% invested in other assets. Because of market volatility, we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate. Given market conditions, we are lowering our long term rate of return assumption for our pension plans to 8.50% for 2011. Our long term rate of return assumption for our postretirement health and life plans will remain at 8.75% for 2011. We believe these two rates are reasonable assumptions for the long term rate of return on our plan assets for 2011 given our investment strategy. We will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions, including our expected rate of return, at least annually. We calculate the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the market related value (MRV) of plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year. Current accounting rules provide that the MRV of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years. For our pension plans, we use a calculated value when determining the MRV of the pension plan assets and recognize changes in fair value over a three year period. Accordingly, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. Financial markets in 2010 contributed to our investment performance resulting in unrecognized net gains. As of December 31, 2010, we had $242 million of cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the MRV of pension assets. For our postretirement benefit plans, we use fair value when 53 Table of Contents determining the MRV of postretirement benefit plan assets, therefore all investment losses and gains have been recognized in the calculation of MRV for these plans. The discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency. The yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans. The discount rate determined on this basis decreased to 5.5% at December 31, 2010 from 5.9% at December 31, 2009. We estimate that our 2011 total pension costs will approximate $167 million compared to $112 million in 2010 primarily due to a lower discount rate, partially offset by better than expected asset returns in 2010 and 2011 contributions. Our 2011 postretirement benefit costs will approximate $137 million compared to $164 million in 2010 primarily due to changing our strategy for providing post 65 prescription drug benefits to retirees, better than expected asset returns in 2010 and favorable retiree medical utilization. These positive impacts were partially offset by a lower discount rate and updated assumed long term retiree medical inflation. Our health care trend rate assumes 7% for 2011 through 2015, 6.5% in 2016, 6% in 2017, 5.5% in 2018 and 5% in 2019 and beyond. Future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design. The pension cost tracking mechanism that provided for recovery or refunding of pension costs above or below amounts reflected in Detroit Edisons base rates, at the request of Detroit Edison, was not reauthorized by the MPSC in its rate order effective January 1, 2009. The MPSC approved the deferral of the non capitalized portion of MichCons negative pension expense. MichCon records a regulatory liability for any negative pension costs, as determined under generally accepted accounting principles. Lowering the expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by one percentage point would have increased our 2010 pension costs by approximately $30 million. Lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased our 2010 pension costs by approximately $10 million. Lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by one percentage point would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2010 by approximately $25 million. The value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets was $3.9 billion at December 31, 2010 and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010 our pension plans were underfunded by $872 million and our other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by $1.3 billion. The 2010 and 2009 funding levels were generally similar due to positive investment performance returns and plan sponsor contributions in 2010 and 2009, largely offset by the decreased discount rates. Pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets. We made contributions to our pension plans of $200 million in each of 2010 and 2009. Also, we contributed $200 million to our pension plans in January 2011. At the discretion of management, consistent with the Pension Protection Act of 2006, and depending upon financial market conditions, we anticipate making contributions to our pension plans of up to $1.2 billion over the next five years. We made postretirement benefit plan contributions of $160 million and $205 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. We are required by orders issued by the MPSC to make postretirement benefit contributions at least equal to the amounts included in Detroit Edisons and MichCons base rates. As a result, we contributed $81 million to our postretirement plans in January 2011 and expect to make up to an additional $90 million contribution to our postretirement plans in 2011 and, subject to MPSC funding requirements, up to $850 million over the next five years. The planned contributions will be made in cash, DTE Energy common stock or a combination of cash and stock. See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Legal Reserves We are involved in various legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters, and establish reserves when appropriate. Legal reserves are based upon managements assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against us. 54 Table of Contents Insured and Uninsured Risks Our comprehensive insurance program provides coverage for various types of risks. Our insurance policies cover risk of loss including property damage, general liability, workers compensation, auto liability, and directors and officers liability. Under our risk management policy, we self insure portions of certain risks up to specified limits, depending on the type of exposure. The maximum self insured retention for various risks is as follows: property damage $10 million, general liability $7 million, workers compensation $9 million, and auto liability $7 million. We have an actuarially determined estimate of our incurred but not reported (IBNR) liability prepared annually and we adjust our reserves for self insured risks as appropriate. As of December 31, 2010, this IBNR liability was approximately $39 million. Accounting for Tax Obligations We are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. We account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two step approach, a more likely than not recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits, no benefit will be recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. We also have non income tax obligations related to property, sales and use and employment related taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters. Accounting for tax obligations requires judgments, including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained, and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. We do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets related to capital losses that we believe will be realized in future periods. We believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 are appropriately accounted. The ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. FAIR VALUE Derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as Derivative Assets or Liabilities. Contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments include power, gas, oil and certain coal forwards, futures, options and swaps, and foreign currency exchange contracts. Items we do not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas inventory, power transmission, pipeline transportation and certain storage assets. See Notes 4 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of adherence to generally accepted accounting principles, the tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of non derivative gas storage, transportation and power contracts. Consequently, gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods, resulting in volatility in DTE Energys reported period by period earnings; however, the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery and or settlement. The Company manages its mark to market (MTM) risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of its contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract. Accordingly, it records and manages the energy purchase and sale obligations under its contracts in separate components based on the commodity (e.g. electricity or gas), the product (e.g. electricity for delivery during peak or off peak hours), the delivery location (e.g. by region), the risk profile (e.g. forward or option), and the delivery period (e.g. by month and year). 55 Table of Contents The Company has established a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). For further discussion of the fair value hierarchy, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following tables provide details on changes in our MTM net asset (or liability) position during 2010: Total (In millions) MTM at December 31, 2009 $ (93 ) Reclassify to realized upon settlement (3 ) Changes in fair value recorded to income 123 Amounts recorded to unrealized income 120 Changes in fair value recorded in regulatory liabilities 6 Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income pre tax 1 Change in collateral held for others (42 ) Option premiums paid (received) and other (36 ) MTM at December 31, 2010 $ (44 ) The table below shows the maturity of our MTM positions: 2014 and Total Fair Source of Fair Value 2011 2012 2013 Beyond Value (In millions) Level 1 $ 9 $ (23 ) $ 11 $ 10 $ 7 Level 2 (68 ) (54 ) (32 ) (154 ) Level 3 29 33 (2 ) (1 ) 59 Total MTM before netting adjustments $ (30 ) $ (44 ) $ (23 ) $ 9 $ (88 ) Collateral adjustments $ 44 Total MTM at December 31, 2010 $ (44 ) Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Price Risk DTE Energy has commodity price risk in both utility and non utility businesses arising from market price fluctuations. The Electric and Gas utility businesses have risks in conjunction with the anticipated purchases of coal, natural gas, uranium, electricity, and base metals to meet their service obligations. However, the Company does not bear significant exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in the form of PSCR and GCR regulatory rate recovery mechanisms. In addition, changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost and stolen gas, storage sales revenue and uncollectible expenses at the Gas Utility. Gas Utility manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of long term storage contracts. The Company is exposed to short term cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery. Our Gas Storage and Pipelines business segment has limited exposure to natural gas price fluctuations and manages its exposure through the sale of long term storage and transportation contracts. Our Unconventional Gas Production business segment has exposure to natural gas and crude oil price fluctuations. These commodity price fluctuations can impact both current year earnings and reserve valuations. To manage this exposure we may use forward energy and futures contracts. 56 Table of Contents Our Power and Industrial Projects business segment is subject to electricity, natural gas, coal and coal based product price risk and other risks associated with the weakened U.S. economy. To the extent that commodity price risk has not been mitigated through the use of long term contracts, we manage this exposure using forward energy, capacity and futures contracts. Our Energy Trading business segment has exposure to electricity, natural gas, crude oil, heating oil, and foreign currency exchange price fluctuations. These risks are managed by our energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy, capacity, storage, options and futures contracts, within pre determined risk parameters. Credit Risk Bankruptcies The Company purchases and sells electricity, gas, coal, coke and other energy products from and to numerous companies operating in the steel, automotive, energy, retail, financial and other industries. Certain of its customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Company regularly reviews contingent matters relating to these customers and its purchase and sale contracts and records provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss. The Company believes its accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss. The final resolution of these matters may have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Other The Company has tracking mechanisms to mitigate a significant amount of losses related to uncollectible accounts receivable at Detroit Edison and MichCon. These mechanisms are subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC and are periodically reviewed. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. We engage in business with customers that are non investment grade. We closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and, when deemed necessary, we request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations. Trading Activities We are exposed to credit risk through trading activities. Credit risk is the potential loss that may result if our trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations. We utilize both external and internal credit assessments when determining the credit quality of our trading counterparties. The following table displays the credit quality of our trading counterparties as of December 31, 2010: Credit Exposure Before Cash Cash Net Credit Collateral Collateral Exposure (In millions) Investment Grade(1) A and Greater $ 163 $ (10 ) $ 153 BBB+ and BBB 199 199 BBB 54 54 Total Investment Grade 416 (10 ) 406 Non investment grade(2) 2 2 Internally Rated investment grade(3) 147 147 Internally Rated non investment grade(4) 12 12 Total $ 577 $ (10 ) $ 567 (1) This category includes counterparties with minimum credit ratings of Baa3 assigned by Moodys Investor Service (Moodys) and BBB assigned by Standard Poors Rating Group (Standard Poors). The five 57 Table of Contents largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented approximately 36 percent of the total gross credit exposure. (2) This category includes counterparties with credit ratings that are below investment grade. The five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented less than one percent of the total gross credit exposure. (3) This category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moodys or Standard Poors, but are considered investment grade based on DTE Energys evaluation of the counterpartys creditworthiness. The five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented approximately 18 percent of the total gross credit exposure. (4) This category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moodys or Standard Poors, and are considered non investment grade based on DTE Energys evaluation of the counterpartys creditworthiness. The five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented approximately two percent of the total gross credit exposure. Interest Rate Risk We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt and preferred securities. In order to manage interest costs, we may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements. Our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in U.S. Treasury rates, commercial paper rates and London Inter Bank Offered Rates (LIBOR). As of December 31, 2010, we had a floating rate debt to total debt ratio of approximately two percent (excluding securitized debt). Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts. These contracts are denominated in Canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of power as well as for long term transportation capacity. To limit our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations, we have entered into a series of exchange forward contracts through January 2013. Additionally, we may enter into fair value foreign currency exchange hedges to mitigate changes in the value of contracts or loans. Summary of Sensitivity Analysis We performed a sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our commodity contracts, long term debt obligations and foreign currency exchange forward contracts. The commodity contracts and foreign currency exchange risk listed below principally relate to our energy marketing and trading activities. The sensitivity analysis involved increasing and decreasing forward rates at December 31, 2010 and 2009 by a hypothetical 10% and calculating the resulting change in the fair values. The results of the sensitivity analysis calculations as of December 31, 2010 and 2009: Assuming a Assuming a 10% Increase in Rates 10% Decrease in Rates As of December 31, As of December 31, Activity 2010 2009 2010 2009 Change in the Fair Value of (In millions) Coal Contracts $ 1 $ $ (1 ) $ Commodity contracts Gas Contracts $ (11 ) $ (2 ) $ 10 $ 1 Commodity contracts Oil Contracts $ $ 1 $ $ (1 ) Commodity contracts Power Contracts $ (5 ) $ (3 ) $ 5 $ 2 Commodity contracts Interest Rate Risk $ (291 ) $ (290 ) $ 313 $ 313 Long term debt Foreign Currency Exchange Risk $ 6 $ 2 $ 7 $ (2 ) Forward contracts Discount Rates $ $ $ $ Commodity contracts For further discussion of market risk, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. 58 Table of Contents
