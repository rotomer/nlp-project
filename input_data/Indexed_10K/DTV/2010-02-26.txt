This measure should be used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures and is not presented as an alternative measure of operating results, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our management and our Board of Directors use operating profit before depreciation and amortization to evaluate the operating performance of our company and our business segments and to allocate resources and capital to business segments. This metric is also used as a measure of performance for incentive compensation purposes and to measure income generated from operations that could be used to fund capital expenditures, service debt or pay taxes. Depreciation and amortization expense primarily represents an allocation to current expense of the cost of historical capital expenditures and for acquired intangible assets resulting from prior business acquisitions. To compensate for the exclusion of depreciation and amortization expense from operating profit, our management and our Board of Directors separately measure and budget for capital expenditures and business acquisitions. We believe this measure is useful to investors, along with GAAP measures (such as revenues, operating profit and net income), to compare our operating performance to other communications, entertainment and media service providers. We believe that investors use current and projected operating profit before depreciation and amortization and similar measures to estimate our current or prospective enterprise value and make investment decisions. This metric provides investors with a means to compare operating results exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. Our management believes this is useful given the significant variation in depreciation and amortization expense that can result from the timing of capital expenditures, the capitalization of intangible assets, potential variations in expected useful lives when compared to other companies and periodic changes to estimated useful lives. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin is calculated by dividing operating profit before depreciation and amortization by Revenues. (2)Free cash flow, which is a financial measure that is not determined in accordance with GAAP, can be calculated by deducting amounts under the captions "Cash paid for property and equipment" and "Cash paid for satellites" from "Net cash provided by operating activities" from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This financial measure should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures and is not presented as an alternative measure of cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our management and our Board of Directors use free cash flow to evaluate the cash generated by our current subscriber base, net of capital expenditures, for the purpose of allocating resources to activities such as adding new subscribers, retaining and upgrading existing subscribers, for additional capital expenditures and other capital investments or transactions and as a measure of performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe this measure is useful to investors, along with other GAAP measures (such as cash flows from operating and investing activities), to compare our operating performance to other communications, entertainment and media companies. We believe that investors also use current and projected free cash flow to determine the ability of revenues from our current and projected subscriber base to fund required and discretionary spending and to help determine our financial value. 45 Table of Contents DIRECTV SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION (concluded) Selected Segment Data Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. Revenues $ 18,671 $ 17,310 $ 15,527 % of total revenues 86.6 % 87.9 % 90.0 % Operating profit $ 2,410 $ 2,330 $ 2,402 Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 2,275 2,061 1,448 Operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 4,685 $ 4,391 $ 3,850 Operating profit margin 12.9 % 13.5 % 15.5 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin 25.1 % 25.4 % 24.8 % Segment assets $ 12,408 $ 12,546 $ 12,297 Capital expenditures 1,485 1,765 2,326 DIRECTV Latin America Revenues $ 2,878 $ 2,383 $ 1,719 % of total revenues 13.3 % 12.1 % 10.0 % Operating profit $ 331 $ 426 $ 159 Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 366 264 235 Operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 697 $ 690 $ 394 Operating profit margin 11.5 % 17.9 % 9.2 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin 24.2 % 29.0 % 22.9 % Segment assets $ 3,772 $ 3,301 $ 2,456 Capital expenditures 584 447 336 Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other Revenues $ 16 % of total revenues 0.1 % Operating loss $ (68 ) $ (61 ) $ (75 ) Add: Depreciation and amortization expense (1 ) (5 ) 1 Operating loss before depreciation and amortization $ (69 ) $ (66 ) $ (74 ) Segment assets $ 2,080 $ 692 $ 310 Capital expenditures 2 17 30 Total Revenues $ 21,565 $ 19,693 $ 17,246 Operating profit $ 2,673 $ 2,695 $ 2,486 Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 2,640 2,320 1,684 Operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 5,313 $ 5,015 $ 4,170 Operating profit margin 12.4 % 13.7 % 14.4 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin 24.6 % 25.5 % 24.2 % Total assets $ 18,260 $ 16,539 $ 15,063 Capital expenditures 2,071 2,229 2,692 46  Table of Contents DIRECTV SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING THE COMPARABILITY OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Acquisitions Liberty Transaction. On November 19, 2009, The DIRECTV Group, Inc., or DIRECTV Group, and Liberty Media Corporation, which we refer to as Liberty or Liberty Media, obtained shareholder approval of and closed a series of related transactions which we refer to collectively as the Liberty Transaction. The Liberty Transaction included the split off of certain of the assets of the Liberty Entertainment group into Liberty Entertainment, Inc., or LEI, which was then split off from Liberty. Following the split off, DIRECTV Group and LEI merged with subsidiaries of DIRECTV. As a result of Liberty Transaction, DIRECTV Group, which is comprised of the DIRECTV U.S. and DIRECTV Latin America businesses, and LEI, which held Libertys 57% interest in DIRECTV Group, a 100% interest in three regional sports networks, a 65% interest in Game Show Network, LLC, approximately $120 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $2.1 billion of indebtedness and a series of related equity collars became wholly owned subsidiaries of DIRECTV. The Liberty Transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting pursuant to accounting standards for business combinations. DIRECTV Group has been treated as the acquiring corporation for accounting and financial reporting purposes, and accordingly the historical financial statements of DIRECTV Group have become the historical financial statements of DIRECTV. The acquisition date fair value of consideration paid, in the form of DIRECTV common stock, for the assets and liabilities of LEI (excluding LEIs interest in DIRECTV Group) has been allocated to a premium expensed at the close of the transaction and to LEIs other tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated acquisition date fair values, with any excess being treated as goodwill. The assets, liabilities and results of operations of LEI have been consolidated beginning on the acquisition date, November 19, 2009. As a result of the Liberty Transaction, we recorded $491 million in charges to "Liberty transaction and related charges" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, which is comprised of: a $337 million charge related to a premium paid to LEI shareholders to complete the merger in the form of an equity interest that exceeded the fair value of net assets acquired by DIRECTV; $43 million of costs incurred to complete the transaction, including legal, accounting, financial printing, investment banking and other costs; and $111 million in net losses recorded for the partial settlement of the equity collars and stock options and stock appreciation rights held by Liberty employees subsequent to the acquisition date, and adjustments of the equity collars and stock options and stock appreciation rights carried as liabilities to fair value as of December 31, 2009. As part of the Liberty Transaction, we assumed a credit facility with a principal balance of $1,878 million, which we refer to as the Collar Loan, and a series of related equity collars which were in a liability position with an estimated acquisition date fair value of $369 million. In connection with the assumption of the Collar Loan, we agreed with the lending bank to promptly repay the Collar Loan and settle the equity collars, which is based on DTV shares. From the acquisition date to December 31, 2009, we repaid a total of $751 million, including $676 million in principal payments and $75 million in payments to settle a portion of the equity collars. Cash paid, net of cash acquired in connection with the transaction was $97 million and includes a $226 million repayment of LEIs existing loan from Liberty at the close of the transaction and $43 million of cash paid for transaction costs, partially offset by $120 million in cash at LEI, and $56 million of cash at the regional sports networks. 47 Table of Contents DIRECTV See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding these transactions and Amendment No. 5 to DIRECTVs Registration Statement on Form S 4 filed with the SEC on October 20, 2009. 180 Connect. In July 2008, we acquired 100% of 180 Connects outstanding common stock and exchangeable shares. Simultaneously, in a separate transaction, UniTek USA, LLC acquired 100% of 180 Connects cable service operating unit and operations in certain of our installation services markets in exchange for satellite installation operations in certain markets and $7 million in cash. These transactions provide us with control over a significant portion of DIRECTV U.S. home service provider network. We paid $91 million in cash, net of the $7 million we received from UniTek USA, for the acquisition, including the equity purchase price, repayment of assumed debt and related transaction costs. Darlene Transaction. On January 30, 2007, we acquired Darlenes 14% equity interest in DLA LLC for $325 million in cash. We accounted for this acquisition using the purchase method of accounting. Other Developments In addition to the items described above, the following items had a significant effect on the comparability of our operating results and financial position as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: Lease Program. On March 1, 2006, DIRECTV U.S. introduced a new set top receiver lease program. Prior to March 1, 2006, we expensed most set top receivers provided to new and existing DIRECTV U.S. subscribers upon activation as a subscriber acquisition or upgrade and retention cost in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Subsequent to the introduction of our lease program, we lease most set top receivers provided to new and existing subscribers, and therefore capitalize the set top receivers in "Property and equipment, net" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table sets forth the amount of DIRECTV U.S. set top receivers we capitalized, and depreciation expense we recorded, under the lease program for the years ended December 31: Capitalized subscriber leased equipment: 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in Millions) Subscriber leased equipment subscriber acquisitions $ 564 $ 599 $ 762 Subscriber leased equipment upgrade and retention 419 537 774 Total subscriber leased equipment capitalized $ 983 $ 1,136 $ 1,536 Depreciation expense subscriber leased equipment $ 1,333 $ 1,100 $ 645 Financing Transactions. On September 22, 2009, DIRECTV U.S. issued $1 billion in five year 4.750% senior notes due in 2014 at a 0.3% discount resulting in $997 million of proceeds. DIRECTV U.S. also issued $1 billion in 10 year 5.875% senior notes due in 2019 at a 0.7% discount resulting in $993 million of proceeds. On September 22, 2009, DIRECTV U.S. purchased, pursuant to a tender offer, $583 million of its then outstanding $910 million 8.375% senior notes at a price of 103.125% plus accrued and unpaid interest, for a total of $603 million. On September 23, 2009, DIRECTV U.S. exercised its right to redeem the remaining $327 million of the 8.375% senior notes at a price of 102.792% plus accrued and 48 Table of Contents DIRECTV unpaid interest. DIRECTV U.S. redeemed the remaining 8.375% senior notes on October 23, 2009 for a total of $339 million. The purchase of our 8.375% senior notes resulted in a 2009 pre tax charge of $34 million, $21 million after tax, of which $29 million resulted from the premium paid for redemption of our 8.375% senior notes and $5 million resulted from the write off of deferred debt issuance costs and other transaction costs. The charge was recorded in "Other, net" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In May 2008, DIRECTV U.S. issued $1.5 billion in senior notes and amended its senior secured credit facility to include a new $1.0 billion Term Loan C. The senior notes bear interest at a rate of 7.625% and the principal balance is due in May 2016. The Term Loan C currently bears interest at a rate of 5.25% and was issued at a 1% discount. Principal payments on the Term Loan C began on September 30, 2008. The principal is payable in installments with the final installment due in April 2013. Venezuela Exchange Controls. We are required to obtain Venezuelan government approval to exchange Venezuelan bolivars fuerte into U.S. dollars at the official rate of 2.15 Venezuelan bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar. Additionally, a legal parallel exchange process exists, however the rates implied by transactions in the parallel market are significantly higher than the official rate (recently 5 to 7 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar). The official approval process has been delayed in recent periods and our Venezuelan subsidiary has in many cases relied on the parallel exchange process to settle U.S. dollar obligations and to repatriate accumulated cash balances. As a result, we recorded a $213 million charge in 2009 and a $29 million charge in 2008 in "General and administrative expenses" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in connection with the exchange of accumulated Venezuelan cash balances to U.S. dollars using the parallel exchange process. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for additional information and the implications of the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency in January 2010. Sky Brazil Functional Currency. Based on cumulatively significant changes in economic facts and circumstances, we have determined that the local Brazilian currency should be the functional currency of Sky Brazil for purposes of financial statement translation beginning in the second quarter of 2009. As a result of this change in functional currency, changes in exchange rates result in gain or losses, which we record in "Other, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the revaluation of U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities, such as cash deposits, notes payable and capital lease obligations held by Sky Brazil. During 2009, we recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of $62 million in "Other, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations related to U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by Sky Brazil. Other Than Temporary Impairment. In 2009, we recognized a $45 million charge for the other than temporary impairment of certain of our investments in "Other, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 49 Table of Contents DIRECTV Share Repurchase Program. Since 2006 our Board of Directors approved multiple authorizations for the repurchase of our common stock. The following table sets forth information regarding shares repurchased and retired for the years ended December 31: 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Total cost of repurchased and retired shares $ 1,696 $ 3,174 $ 2,025 Average price per share 23.79 24.12 23.48 Number of shares repurchased and retired 71 131 86 KEY TERMINOLOGY Revenues. We earn revenues mostly from monthly fees we charge subscribers for subscriptions to basic and premium channel programming, HD programming and access fees, pay per view programming, and seasonal and live sporting events. We also earn revenues from monthly fees that we charge subscribers with multiple non leased set top receivers (which we refer to as mirroring fees), monthly fees we charge subscribers for leased set top receivers, monthly fees we charge subscribers for digital video recorder, or DVR, service, hardware revenues from subscribers who lease or purchase set top receivers from us, our published programming guide, warranty service fees and advertising services. Broadcast Programming and Other. These costs primarily include license fees for subscription service programming, pay per view programming, live sports and other events. Other costs include expenses associated with the publication and distribution of our programming guide, continuing service fees paid to third parties for active subscribers, warranty service costs and production costs for on air advertisements we sell to third parties. Subscriber Service Expenses. Subscriber service expenses include the costs of customer call centers, billing, remittance processing and certain home services expenses, such as in home repair costs. Broadcast Operations Expenses. These expenses include broadcast center operating costs, signal transmission expenses (including costs of collecting signals for our local channel offerings), and costs of monitoring, maintaining and insuring our satellites. Also included are engineering expenses associated with deterring theft of our signal. Subscriber Acquisition Costs. These costs include the cost of set top receivers and other equipment, commissions we pay to national retailers, independent satellite television retailers, dealers, telcos, and the cost of installation, advertising, marketing and customer call center expenses associated with the acquisition of new subscribers. Set top receivers leased to new subscribers are capitalized in "Property and equipment, net" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciated over their useful lives. The amount of set top receivers capitalized each period for subscriber acquisitions is included in "Cash paid for property and equipment" in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Upgrade and Retention Costs. Upgrade and retention costs are associated with upgrade efforts for existing subscribers that we believe will result in higher average monthly revenue per subscriber, or ARPU, and lower churn. Our upgrade efforts include subscriber equipment upgrade programs for DVR, HD and HD DVR receivers and local channels, our multiple set top receiver offer and similar initiatives. Retention costs also include the costs of installing and providing hardware under our movers program for subscribers relocating to a new residence. Set top receivers leased to existing subscribers under upgrade and retention programs are capitalized in "Property and equipment, net" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciated over their useful lives. The amount of set top receivers 50 Table of Contents DIRECTV capitalized each period for upgrade and retention programs is included in "Cash paid for property and equipment" in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include departmental costs for legal, administrative services, finance, marketing and information technology. These costs also include expenses for bad debt and other operating expenses, such as legal settlements, and gains or losses from the sale or disposal of fixed assets. Average Monthly Revenue Per Subscriber. We calculate ARPU by dividing average monthly revenues for the period (total revenues during the period divided by the number of months in the period) by average subscribers for the period. We calculate average subscribers for the period by adding the number of subscribers as of the beginning of the period and for each quarter end in the current year or period and dividing by the sum of the number of quarters in the period plus one. Average Monthly Subscriber Churn. Average monthly subscriber churn represents the number of subscribers whose service is disconnected, expressed as a percentage of the average total number of subscribers. We calculate average monthly subscriber churn by dividing the average monthly number of disconnected subscribers for the period (total subscribers disconnected, net of reconnects, during the period divided by the number of months in the period) by average subscribers for the period. Subscriber Count. The total number of subscribers represents the total number of subscribers actively subscribing to our service, including seasonal subscribers, subscribers who are in the process of relocating and commercial equivalent viewing units. In March 2008, we implemented a change in DIRECTV U.S. commercial pricing and packaging to increase our competitiveness. As a result, during the first quarter of 2008, DIRECTV U.S. made a one time downward adjustment to the subscriber count of approximately 71,000 subscribers related to commercial equivalent viewing units. SAC. We calculate SAC, which represents total subscriber acquisition costs stated on a per subscriber basis, by dividing total subscriber acquisition costs for the period by the number of gross new subscribers acquired during the period. We calculate total subscriber acquisition costs for the period by adding together "Subscriber acquisition costs" expensed during the period and the amount of cash paid for equipment leased to new subscribers during the period. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK The United States and the other countries in which we operate are continuing to undergo a period of substantial economic uncertainty. As discussed in "Competition" in Item 1, in addition to cable and satellite system operators, we are experiencing increasing competition from telcos and other emerging digital media distribution providers. A more severe downturn in economic activity or further competitive pressures could have a detrimental impact on our forecasted revenue, operating margins, net subscriber additions, free cash flow and net income. Please refer to "Risk Factors" in Item 1A for a further discussion of risks which may affect forecasted results or our business generally. DIRECTV U.S. Our revenue growth is generated by both increases in the average monthly rates we earn from subscribers, or ARPU, and increases in the total number of subscribers. In 2010, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digit percentage range. We anticipate higher ARPU growth in 2010, offset by a reduction in revenue growth from net subscriber additions compared to 2009. In 2010, as a result of the anticipated growth in revenues, the economies of scale in our business, and lower gross subscriber additions, we expect operating profit before depreciation and amortization growth in the low teens percentage range. 51 Table of Contents DIRECTV In 2010, we expect capital expenditures to approximate capital expenditures reported for 2009. DIRECTV Latin America. In 2010, we expect revenue growth of roughly half of the growth experienced in 2009. Although we anticipate net subscriber additions to be similar to 2009, this growth will likely be partially offset by lower ARPU in the region caused by the recently announced devaluation of the Venezuelan currency, discussed in more detail below under "Liquidity and Capital Resources". As a result of the anticipated growth in revenues and the economies of scale in Latin America, in 2010 we expect operating profit before depreciation and amortization growth of more than 20%. In 2010, we expect capital expenditures in Latin America to exceed 2009 capital expenditures due to anticipated higher gross subscriber additions and increased sales of advanced products. DIRECTV. At the consolidated DIRECTV level, we anticipate free cash flow, or cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to grow in the mid single digit percent range. The improvements in operating profit before depreciation and amortization are expected to be partly offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes due to the anticipated increase in pre tax earnings and the cessation of benefits realized during the past two years associated with two Federal economic stimulus programs in the U.S. as well as higher capital expenditures at DIRECTV Latin America and higher expected interest expense. 2010 diluted earnings per common share is expected to more than double compared to 2009. The expected increase in 2010 is due to the anticipated growth in operating profit before depreciation and amortization, lower depreciation and amortization expense, and a continued decline in weighted average common shares outstanding due to anticipated share repurchases. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Consolidated Results of Operations We discuss changes for each of our segments in more detail below. Revenues. The following table presents our revenues by segment: Revenues by segment: Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 18,671 $ 17,310 $ 1,361 7.9 % DIRECTV Latin America 2,878 2,383 495 20.8 % Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other 16 16 N/A Total Revenues $ 21,565 $ 19,693 $ 1,872 9.5 % The increase in our total revenues was due to subscriber growth and higher ARPU at DIRECTV U.S. and DIRECTV Latin America. 52  Table of Contents DIRECTV Operating profit before depreciation and amortization. The following table presents our operating profit (loss) before depreciation and amortization by segment: Operating profit (loss) before depreciation and amortization by segment: Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 4,685 $ 4,391 $ 294 6.7 % DIRECTV Latin America 697 690 7 1.0 % Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other (69 ) (66 ) (3 ) 4.5 % Total operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 5,313 $ 5,015 $ 298 5.9 % The increase in total operating profit before depreciation and amortization was due to higher gross profit from the increase in revenues, partially offset by higher subscriber acquisition, upgrade and retention and general and administrative costs at both DIRECTV U.S. and DIRECTV Latin America. Operating profit. The following table presents our operating profit (loss) by segment: Operating profit (loss) by segment: Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 2,410 $ 2,330 $ 80 3.4 % DIRECTV Latin America 331 426 (95 ) (22.3 )% Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other (68 ) (61 ) (7 ) 11.5 % Total operating profit $ 2,673 $ 2,695 $ (22 ) (0.8 )% The decrease in our operating profit was primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization from the DIRECTV U.S. and DIRECTV Latin America set top receiver lease programs, more than offsetting our increase in operating profit before depreciation and amortization. Interest income. The decrease in interest income to $41 million in 2009 from $81 million in 2008 was due to lower interest rates and lower average cash balances due mostly to the use of cash to fund our share repurchase program. Interest expense. The increase in interest expense to $423 million in 2009 from $360 million in 2008 was due to an increase in the average debt balance compared to 2008, partially offset by decreased interest rates. We capitalized $18 million of interest costs in both 2008 and 2009. Liberty transaction and related charges. In 2009 we incurred $491 million in costs related to the Liberty Transaction, which is comprised of a $337 premium paid to LEI shareholders, $111 million in net losses for the partial settlement and fair value adjustments related to the equity collars and non employee stock options and stock appreciation rights and $43 million of charges for transaction related costs. 53 Table of Contents DIRECTV Other, net. The significant components of "Other, net" were as follows: 2009 2008 Change (Dollars in Millions) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries $ 51 $ 55 $ (4 ) Net foreign currency transaction gain 62 62 Loss from impairment of investments (45 ) (45 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt (34 ) (34 ) Net gain (loss) from sale of investments 1 (1 ) Other (1 ) 1 Total $ 34 $ 55 $ (21 ) In 2009, Other, net decreased due primarily to the recognition of a charge for the other than temporary impairment of investments, a loss on the early extinguishment of our 8.375% senior notes and decreased earnings from our unconsolidated subsidiaries, partially offset by a foreign currency transaction gain related to net U.S. dollar denominated liabilities held by Sky Brazil. Income tax expense. The increase in the effective tax rate to 45% in 2009 from 35% in 2008 is primarily attributable to the non recoverability of Liberty Transaction related charges. Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes. During 2008, we recorded a net $6 million adjustment as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations in the federal jurisdiction offset by the write off of foreign incentive income tax benefits related to previously divested businesses. Noncontrolling interests in net earnings of subsidiaries. We recognized noncontrolling interest in net earnings of subsidiaries of $65 million in 2009 and $92 million in 2008 at Sky Brazil. Noncontrolling interest in net earnings of subsidiaries in 2009 decreased due to lower net income at Sky Brazil. 54 Table of Contents DIRECTV DIRECTV U.S. Segment The following table provides operating results and a summary of key subscriber data for the DIRECTV U.S. segment: Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Subscriber Amounts) Revenues $ 18,671 $ 17,310 $ 1,361 7.9 % Operating costs and expenses Costs of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense Broadcast programming and other 8,027 7,424 603 8.1 % Subscriber service expenses 1,268 1,139 129 11.3 % Broadcast operations expenses 274 265 9 3.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense Subscriber acquisition costs 2,478 2,191 287 13.1 % Upgrade and retention costs 1,045 1,027 18 1.8 % General and administrative expenses 894 873 21 2.4 % Depreciation and amortization expense 2,275 2,061 214 10.4 % Total operating costs and expenses 16,261 14,980 1,281 8.6 % Operating profit $ 2,410 $ 2,330 $ 80 3.4 % Other data: Operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 4,685 $ 4,391 $ 294 6.7 % Total number of subscribers (000s) (1) 18,560 17,621 939 5.3 % ARPU $ 85.48 $ 83.90 $ 1.58 1.9 % Average monthly subscriber churn % 1.53 % 1.47 % 4.1 % Gross subscriber additions (000s) 4,273 3,904 369 9.5 % Subscriber disconnections (000s) 3,334 3,043 291 9.6 % Net subscriber additions (000s) 939 861 78 9.1 % Average subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber (SAC) $ 712 $ 715 $ (3 ) (0.4 )% (1)As discussed above in "Key Terminology," during 2008, we had a one time downward adjustment to our subscriber count of approximately 71,000 subscribers related to commercial equivalent viewing units. This adjustment did not affect our revenue, operating profit, cash flows, net subscriber additions or average monthly subscriber churn. Subscribers. In 2009, gross subscriber additions increased primarily due to more aggressive promotions, marketing of the AT&T/DIRECTV bundle which began in February 2009, higher demand for advanced services and the impact of the transition to digital programming by broadcasters in the first half of 2009. Net subscriber additions increased from 2008 primarily due to the increase in gross additions, partially offset by higher subscriber disconnections due to a higher average monthly churn rate on a larger subscriber base. Average monthly subscriber churn increased primarily due to stricter upgrade and retention policies for existing customers as well as more aggressive competitor promotions combined with a weaker economy. 55 Table of Contents DIRECTV Revenues. DIRECTV U.S. revenues increased as a result of the larger subscriber base and higher ARPU. The increase in ARPU resulted primarily from price increases on programming packages, higher HD and DVR product penetration, partially offset by more competitive customer promotions, the elimination of satellite lease revenue and lower premium movie package buy rates. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization. The improvement of operating profit before depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the gross profit generated from the higher revenues, partially offset by higher subscriber acquisition costs principally related to the increase in gross subscriber additions. Broadcast programming and other costs increased due to the larger number of subscribers in 2009 and annual program supplier rate increases. Subscriber service expenses increased primarily due to a larger subscriber base in 2009 and costs associated with service quality improvement initiatives. Subscriber acquisition costs increased primarily due to an increase in gross subscriber additions compared to 2008 and increased marketing and advertising costs. SAC per subscriber, which includes the cost of capitalized set top receivers, decreased primarily due to lower set top receiver costs and greater savings related to the increased usage of refurbished set top receivers through our lease program. Upgrade and retention costs increased in 2009 primarily due to the larger subscriber base, partially offset by decreased installation costs and decreased spending on other programs due to stricter spending policies. General and administrative expenses increased in 2009 primarily due to increased labor and benefit expense from the increase in headcount within our owned and operated home service provider installation business, partially offset by a $14 million charge in 2008 for the write off of accounts receivable for equipment and other costs incurred to effect the orderly transition of services from one of our home service providers that ceased operations. Operating profit. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense in 2009 resulting from the capitalization of set top receivers under the lease program. 56 Table of Contents DIRECTV DIRECTV Latin America Segment The following table provides operating results and a summary of key subscriber data for the DIRECTV Latin America segment: Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Subscriber Amounts) Revenues $ 2,878 $ 2,383 $ 495 20.8 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization 697 690 7 1.0 % Operating profit 331 426 (95 ) (22.3 )% Other data: ARPU $ 57.12 $ 55.07 $ 2.05 3.7 % Average monthly subscriber churn % (1) 1.75 % 1.78 % (1.7 )% Total number of subscribers (000s) (2) 4,588 3,883 705 18.2 % Gross subscriber additions (000s) 1,575 1,393 182 13.1 % Net subscriber additions (000s) 692 623 69 11.1 % (1)In the year ended December 31, 2008, DIRECTV Latin America had a subscriber adjustment totaling 78,000 subscribers in Sky Brazil as a result of the inconsistent application of churn policies in previous periods and the completion of the Sky Brazil and DIRECTV Brazil business integration. (2)DIRECTV Latin America subscriber data excludes subscribers of the Sky Mexico platform. We migrated approximately 3,000 subscribers from DIRECTV Latin America to Sky Mexico during 2009 and migrated approximately 19,000 subscribers from DIRECTV Latin America to Sky Mexico during 2008. Additionally, we migrated approximately 16,000 subscribers from a local pay television service provider in Latin America to Sky Brazil during 2009. Net subscriber additions as well as churn exclude the effect of these migrations. The increase in net subscriber additions was due to strong subscriber demand across the region, particularly in Colombia, Brazil and Puerto Rico, increased demand for DVR, HD and pre paid services, as well as targeted customer promotions. The decrease in average monthly subscriber churn was primarily due to two downward subscriber adjustments in 2008 totaling 78,000 subscribers. Excluding these subscriber adjustments, churn would have increased 17 basis points principally due to the growth of DTVLAs prepaid business. Revenues increased in 2009 primarily due to strong subscriber and ARPU growth. ARPU increased mainly due to price increases in Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina, as well as higher fees for HD and DVR services, partially offset by foreign currency devaluations, particularly in Brazil and Argentina. The higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization is primarily due to the gross profit generated from the higher revenues, partially offset by higher general and administrative expense due primarily to $213 million in currency related transaction fees in Venezuela, an increase in subscriber acquisition costs mostly due to an increase in gross subscriber additions and higher subscriber service costs primarily related to customer service improvement initiatives and the larger subscriber base. 57 Table of Contents DIRECTV The lower operating profit was primarily due to the increase in operating profit before depreciation and amortization, offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to an increase in basic and advance product receivers leased over the last year. Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other Operating loss from Sports Networks, Elimination and Other increased to $68 million in 2009 from $61 million in 2008. Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other primarily consisted of corporate operating costs until November 19, 2009 when we completed the Liberty Transaction and acquired the RSNs. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Consolidated Results of Operations We discuss changes for each of our segments in more detail below. Revenues. The following table presents our revenues by segment: Revenues by segment: Change 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 17,310 $ 15,527 $ 1,783 11.5 % DIRECTV Latin America 2,383 1,719 664 38.6 % Total Revenues $ 19,693 $ 17,246 $ 2,447 14.2 % The increase in our total revenues was due to higher ARPU and subscriber growth at DIRECTV U.S. and DIRECTV Latin America. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization. The following table presents our operating profit (loss) before depreciation and amortization by segment: Operating profit (loss) before depreciation and amortization by segment: Change 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 4,391 $ 3,850 $ 541 14.1 % DIRECTV Latin America 690 394 296 75.1 % Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other (66 ) (74 ) 8 (10.8 )% Total operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 5,015 $ 4,170 $ 845 20.3 % The increase in total operating profit before depreciation and amortization was due to higher gross profit from the increase in revenues, partially offset by higher subscriber acquisition, upgrade and retention and general and administrative costs at both DIRECTV U.S. and DIRECTV Latin America. 58 Table of Contents DIRECTV Operating profit. The following table presents our operating profit (loss) by segment: Operating profit (loss) by segment: Change 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 2,330 $ 2,402 $ (72 ) (3.0 )% DIRECTV Latin America 426 159 267 167.9 % Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other (61 ) (75 ) 14 (18.7 )% Total operating profit $ 2,695 $ 2,486 $ 209 8.4 % The increase in our operating profit was primarily due to increased operating profit before depreciation and amortization, partially offset by the increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to the DIRECTV U.S. lease program. Interest income. The decrease in interest income to $81 million in 2008 from $111 million in 2007 was due to lower interest rates and lower average cash balances due mostly to the use of cash to fund our share repurchase program. Interest expense. The increase in interest expense from $235 million in 2007 to $360 million in 2008 was due to an increase in the average debt balance compared to 2007 and lower capitalization of interest cost in 2008. We capitalized $18 million of interest costs in 2008 and $51 million in 2007. The reduction in the capitalization of interest costs was due to the successful completion and launch of two satellites. Other, net. The significant components of "Other, net" were as follows: 2008 2007 Change (Dollars in Millions) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries $ 55 $ 35 $ 20 Net gain (loss) from sale of investments 1 (6 ) 7 Other (1 ) (3 ) 2 Total $ 55 $ 26 $ 29 Income tax expense. We recognized income tax expense of $864 million in 2008 compared to $943 million in 2007. The lower income tax expense in 2008 is primarily attributable to foreign earnings taxed at less than our domestic statutory rates, a partial reversal of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of foreign subsidiaries as a result of recent profitability and recognition of tax credits due to state tax legislation. Net Income attributable to noncontrolling interests. We recognized net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in net earnings of subsidiaries of $92 million in 2008 and $11 million in 2007 primarily from Sky Brazil. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2008 increased due to higher net income and $23 million from the partial reversal of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at Sky Brazil attributable to the noncontrolling interest holder. Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes. During 2008, we recorded a net $6 million adjustment as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations in the federal jurisdiction offset by the write off of foreign incentive income tax benefits related to previously divested businesses. During 2007, we recorded a $17 million reduction to our unrecognized tax benefits as a result of a settlement of a foreign withholding dispute from a previously divested business. 59 Table of Contents DIRECTV DIRECTV U.S. Segment The following table provides operating results and a summary of key subscriber data for the DIRECTV U.S. segment: Change 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Subscriber Amounts) Revenues $ 17,310 $ 15,527 $ 1,783 11.5 % Operating costs and expenses Costs of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense Broadcast programming and other 7,424 6,681 743 11.1 % Subscriber service expenses 1,139 1,137 2 0.2 % Broadcast operations expenses 265 216 49 22.7 % Selling, general and administrative expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense Subscriber acquisition costs 2,191 1,901 290 15.3 % Upgrade and retention costs 1,027 958 69 7.2 % General and administrative expenses 873 784 89 11.4 % Depreciation and amortization expense 2,061 1,448 613 42.3 % Total operating costs and expenses 14,980 13,125 1,855 14.1 % Operating profit $ 2,330 $ 2,402 $ (72 ) (3.0 )% Other data: Operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 4,391 $ 3,850 $ 541 14.1 % Total number of subscribers (000s) (1) 17,621 16,831 790 4.7 % ARPU $ 83.90 $ 79.05 $ 4.85 6.1 % Average monthly subscriber churn % 1.47 % 1.51 % (2.6 )% Gross subscriber additions (000s) 3,904 3,847 57 1.5 % Subscriber disconnections (000s) 3,043 2,969 74 2.5 % Net subscriber additions (000s) 861 878 (17 ) (1.9 )% Average subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber (SAC) $ 715 $ 692 $ 23 3.3 % (1)As discussed above in "Key Terminology," during 2008, we had a one time downward adjustment to our subscriber count of approximately 71,000 subscribers related to commercial equivalent viewing units. This adjustment did not affect our revenue, operating profit, cash flows, net subscriber additions or average monthly subscriber churn. Subscribers. In 2008, gross subscriber additions increased primarily due to growth in the direct sales and retail distribution channels due in large part to more attractive promotions and higher demand for HD and DVR services, partially offset by the loss of a distribution relationship with BellSouth during the last three quarters of 2008. Average monthly subscriber churn decreased primarily due to increased sales of HD and DVR services as well as from lower involuntary churn associated with the continued effect of stringent credit policies. Net subscriber additions declined slightly from 2007 as the increase in gross additions was offset by higher subscriber disconnections. Revenues. DIRECTV U.S. revenues increased as a result of higher ARPU and the larger subscriber base. The increase in ARPU resulted primarily from price increases on programming 60 Table of Contents DIRECTV packages, higher HD and DVR service fees, and an increase in lease fees due to higher average number of receivers per subscriber, partially offset by more competitive customer promotions and slightly lower upfront equipment fees. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization. The improvement of operating profit before depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the gross profit generated from the higher revenues, partially offset by higher subscriber acquisition, upgrade and retention costs for the increased number of new and existing customers adding HD and DVR services, as well as increased general and administrative costs. Broadcast programming and other costs increased due to annual program supplier rate increases and the larger number of subscribers in 2008. Subscriber service expenses remained essentially flat with a larger subscriber base in 2008 due to the cost savings from a decline in customer call volume and a lower call handle time. Broadcast operations expense increased in 2008 due primarily to costs to support advanced services, HD enhancements and VOD. Subscriber acquisition costs increased due to higher sales, marketing and advertising costs and higher costs associated with the acquisition of higher quality and advanced product customers. SAC per subscriber, which includes the cost of capitalized set top receivers, increased due to higher sales, marketing and advertising costs and higher costs associated with the acquisition of higher quality and advanced product customers, partially offset by lower set top receiver costs. Upgrade and retention costs increased in 2008 due to an increase in the movers program and other marketing programs. General and administrative expenses increased in 2008 primarily due to a $25 million one time gain recognized in the second quarter of 2007 related to hurricane insurance recoveries, a $14 million charge in 2008 for the write off of accounts receivable for equipment and other costs incurred to effect the orderly transition of services from one of our home service providers that ceased operations, $24 million in charges associated with the settlement of multiple legal proceedings and an increase in labor and benefit costs. Operating profit. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense in 2008 resulting from the capitalization of set top receivers under the lease program. 61 Table of Contents DIRECTV DIRECTV Latin America Segment The following table provides operating results and a summary of key subscriber data for the DIRECTV Latin America segment: Change 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Subscriber Amounts) Revenues $ 2,383 $ 1,719 $ 664 38.6 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization 690 394 296 75.1 % Operating profit 426 159 267 167.9 % Other data: ARPU $ 55.07 $ 48.33 $ 6.74 13.9 % Average monthly subscriber churn % 1.78 % 1.38 % 29.0 % Total number of subscribers (000s) (1) 3,883 3,279 604 18.4 % Gross subscriber additions (000s) 1,393 1,080 313 29.0 % Net subscriber additions (000s) 623 588 35 6.0 % (1)DIRECTV Latin America subscriber data exclude subscribers of the Sky Mexico platform. Net subscriber additions as well as churn exclude the effect of the migration of approximately 19,000 subscribers from Central America to Sky Mexico in 2008 and approximately 20,000 in 2007. The increase in net subscriber additions was due to higher gross subscriber additions mainly in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, partially offset by higher churn of 1.78% in the region. The increase in churn was due to two downward subscriber adjustments totaling 78,000 subscribers in Sky Brazil as a result of the inconsistent application of churn policies in previous periods and the completion of the Sky Brazil and DIRECTV Brazil business integration. Excluding these subscriber adjustments in the current year, churn would have been 1.58%, which is higher than the prior year period primarily due to increased competition, higher churn in our prepaid business and a more challenging macroeconomic environment. Revenues increased in 2008 primarily due to strong subscriber and ARPU growth. ARPU increased mainly due to favorable exchange rates in Brazil in the first three quarters of 2008, as well as strong ARPU growth in PanAmericana, particularly in Venezuela and Argentina. The higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization is primarily due to the gross profit generated from the higher revenues, partially offset by an increase in subscriber acquisition costs mostly due to the 29% increase in gross additions, higher general and administrative expense due primarily to $29 million in currency related transaction fees in Venezuela and increased costs related to foreign currency exchange rate appreciation. The higher operating profit was primarily due to the increase in operating profit before depreciation and amortization partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense. Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other Operating loss from Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other decreased to $61 million in 2008 from $75 million in 2007. 62 Table of Contents DIRECTV LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents and the cash flow that we generate from our operations. From 2007 to 2009 we experienced significant growth in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow. We expect net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow to continue to grow and believe that our existing cash balances and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund our existing business plan. Additionally, as of December 31, 2009, DIRECTV U.S. had the ability to borrow up to $500 million under its existing credit facility, which is available until 2011. Borrowings under this facility may be required to fund strategic investment opportunities should they arise. At December 31, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.6 billion compared with $2.0 billion at December 31, 2008. As a measure of liquidity, the current ratio (ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 0.89 at December 31, 2009 and 1.13 at December 31, 2008. Working capital decreased by $1,105 million to a $646 million deficit at December 31, 2009 from working capital of $459 million at December 31, 2008. The decrease during the period was mostly due to the increase in our current debt balance due to the assumption of debt and the related equity collars as part of the Liberty Transaction. Summary Cash Flow Information Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in Millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,431 $ 3,910 $ 3,645 Net cash used in investing activities (2,194 ) (2,388 ) (2,822 ) Net cash used in financing activities (1,637 ) (600 ) (2,239 ) Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,431 $ 3,910 $ 3,645 Less: Cash paid for property, equipment and satellites (2,071 ) (2,229 ) (2,692 ) Free cash flow $ 2,360 $ 1,681 $ 953 Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities The increases in net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to our higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization, which resulted from the higher gross profit generated from an increase in revenues, and in 2009 due to lower payments for income taxes compared to 2008. Cash paid for income taxes was $484 million in 2009, $706 million in 2008 and $408 million in 2007. The decrease in cash paid for income taxes in 2009 resulted mainly from decreased income from continuing operations and prior year tax credits. Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities During both 2008 and 2009, we experienced a reduction in set top receiver costs and benefited from the use of refurbished set top receivers from the DIRECTV U.S. lease program, which resulted in a reduction in capital expenditures for property and equipment in 2008 and 2009. Also at DIRECTV U.S., during 2007, 2008 and 2009, we were in the process of constructing three satellites. We have completed and placed two of these satellites into service, which resulted in decreasing satellite capital expenditures over the three year period. We expect to place the last of these 63 Table of Contents DIRECTV satellites in service in the second quarter of 2010. Additionally, our capital expenditures for broadcast facilities and equipment to support our HD programming has decreased from 2007 to 2009 as we have largely completed the build out of the infrastructure necessary to launch HD programming both locally and nationally. These decreases in capital expenditures for property and equipment have been offset by an increase in capital expenditures in Latin America for set top receivers provided to subscribers under lease programs. Part of our business strategy in Latin America is to increase advanced product and multi box penetrations; therefore, our capital expenditures in Latin America are expected to increase. Additionally, we paid $37 million in 2009, $204 million in 2008 and $348 million in 2007 for investments, net of cash acquired, in various companies and $97 million, net of cash acquired, as part of the Liberty Transaction. These transactions are described in Notes 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Also, in 2007 we had cash flows from investing activities resulting from net cash proceeds received from the sale of short term investments. Our cash spending on investment in companies is discretionary and we may fund strategic investment opportunities should they arise in the future. Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities Under stock repurchase plans approved by our Board of Directors we completed the repurchase of our common stock as follows: $1,696 million during 2009, $3,174 million during 2008, and $2,025 million during 2007. In February 2010, we announced an increase in the amount of authorized repurchases to $3.5 billion, which is expected to be completed during 2010. We may make purchases under this program in the open market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing, nature and amount of such transactions will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and the program may be suspended, discontinued or accelerated at any time. The sources of funds for the purchases under the remaining authorization are our existing cash on hand, cash from operations and potential additional borrowings. During 2008 we had $2,490 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility which were completed in May 2008 and received a $160 million capital contribution in connection with Libertys acquisition of its equity interest in us from News Corporation. During 2009, we had $1,990 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of senior notes which were completed in September 2009. We also repaid $1,018 million of our long term debt, and paid approximately $751 million to settle a portion of the debt and related equity collars assumed as part of the Liberty Transaction. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow increased in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to an increase in net cash provided by operating activities described above, and the decrease in capital expenditures and the decrease in cash paid for taxes described above. The decrease in capital expenditures resulted from lower costs for set top receivers capitalized under the DIRECTV U.S. lease program and lower capital expenditures for satellite and broadcast facilities and equipment to support HD programming partially offset by increased capital expenditures in Latin America for subscriber leased equipment. During 2010, we expect continued free cash flow growth primarily as a result of the anticipated increase in operating profit before depreciation and amortization. 64 Table of Contents DIRECTV Debt At December 31, 2009, we had $8,010 million in total outstanding borrowings, bearing a weighted average interest rate of 5.0%. Our outstanding borrowings primarily consist of notes payable, the Collar Loan and amounts borrowed under a senior secured credit facility of DIRECTV U.S. as more fully described in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Part II of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. During the first quarter of 2010, we paid $1,537 million to repay the remaining principal balance of the Collar Loan and settle the related equity collars, and accordingly will report a gain of approximately $65 million in the first quarter of 2010 related to the Collar Loan. Our notes payable and senior secured credit facility mature as follows: $308 million in 2010, $108 million in 2011, $20 million in 2012, $1,887 million in 2013, $1,000 million in 2014 and $3,500 million thereafter. These amounts do not reflect potential prepayments that may be required under our senior secured credit facility, which could result from a computation that we are required to make at each year end under the credit agreement. We were not required to make a prepayment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Covenants and Restrictions. The senior secured credit facility requires DIRECTV U.S. to comply with certain financial covenants. The senior notes and the senior secured credit facility also include covenants that restrict DIRECTV U.S. ability to, among other things, (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) incur liens, (iii) pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, investments or acquisitions, (iv) enter into certain transactions with affiliates, (v) merge or consolidate with another entity, (vi) sell, assign, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, and (vii) make voluntary prepayments of certain debt, in each case subject to exceptions as provided in the credit agreement and senior notes indentures. DIRECTV U.S. 4.750% and 5.875% senior notes are rated as investment grade and have fewer covenants and restrictions than our other senior notes. Should DIRECTV U.S. fail to comply with these covenants, all or a portion of its borrowings under the senior notes and senior secured credit facility could become immediately payable and its revolving credit facility could be terminated. At December 31, 2009, DIRECTV U.S. was in compliance with all such covenants and we expect to continue to be in compliance with all covenants in 2010. Contingencies As discussed in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, Globo has the right to exchange Sky Brazil shares for cash or our common shares. If Globo exercises this right, we have the option to elect to pay the consideration in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of both. Venezuela Exchange Controls. Through December 31, 2009 we utilized the official exchange rate of 2.15 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar to translate the financial statements of our Venezuelan subsidiary. This rate has been fixed despite significant inflation in Venezuela in recent periods. We are required to obtain Venezuelan government approval to exchange Venezuelan bolivars fuerte into U.S. dollars at the official rate, or alternatively, a legal parallel exchange process exists, however the rates implied by transactions in the parallel market are significantly higher than the official rate (recently 5 to 7 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar). The official approval process has been delayed in recent periods and our Venezuelan subsidiary has relied on the parallel exchange process to settle U.S. dollar obligations and to repatriate accumulated cash balances. As a result we recorded a $213 million charge during the year ended December 31, 2009 and a $29 million charge during the year ended December 31, 2008 in "General and administrative expense" in the Consolidated Statements of 65 Table of Contents DIRECTV Operations in connection with the exchange of accumulated Venezuelan cash balances to U.S. dollars using the parallel exchange process. In January 2010, the Venezuelan government announced the creation of a dual exchange rate system, including an exchange rate of 4.3 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar for most of the activities of our Venezuelan operations. As a result of this devaluation, we estimate an approximate $6 million charge to net income in the first quarter of 2010 related to the adjustment of net bolivars fuerte denominated monetary assets to the new official exchange rate. We will also begin reporting the operating results of our Venezuelan subsidiary in the first quarter of 2010 using the devalued rate, which will result in a 50% reduction in revenues and local currency operating costs. As a result of our policy of repatriating excess cash balances using the parallel exchange rate beginning in 2009, we do not expect a significant reduction in operating profits from our Venezuelan operations in 2010 due to the devaluation of the official exchange rate as the effect of devaluation will be offset by lower charges for the repatriation of cash. We currently expect to continue to repatriate cash generated in Venezuela in excess of local operating requirements, and to the extent we are unable to obtain timely approval to exchange bolivars fuerte at the official rate, we may use the legal parallel exchange process and we expect to incur additional charges in the future. Using the official exchange rate as of December 31, 2009, our Venezuelan subsidiary had Venezuelan bolivar fuerte denominated assets of $15 million in excess of Venezuelan bolivar fuerte denominated liabilities, including cash of $33 million as of December 31, 2009. Other. Several factors may affect our ability to fund our operations and commitments that we discuss in "Contractual Obligations", "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements" and "Contingencies" below. In addition, our future cash flows may be reduced if we experience, among other things, significantly higher subscriber additions than planned, increased subscriber churn or upgrade and retention costs, higher than planned capital expenditures for satellites and broadcast equipment, satellite anomalies or signal theft or if we are required to make a prepayment on our term loans under DIRECTV U.S. senior secured credit facility. Additionally, DIRECTV U.S. ability to borrow under the senior secured credit facility is contingent upon DIRECTV U.S. meeting financial and other covenants associated with its facility as more fully described above. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009, including the future periods in which payments are expected. Additional details regarding these obligations are 66 Table of Contents DIRECTV provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 referenced in the table. Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Dollars in Millions) Long term debt obligations (Note 9) (a) $ 9,102 $ 665 $ 830 $ 3,473 $ 4,134 Purchase obligations (Note 19) (b) 9,696 1,805 3,705 2,745 1,441 Operating lease obligations (Note 19) (c) 402 65 118 74 145 Capital lease obligations (Note 11) 930 89 171 159 511 Other long term liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under GAAP (Note 19) (d) 140 91 49 Total (e) $ 20,270 $ 2,715 $ 4,873 $ 6,451 $ 6,231 (a)Long term debt obligations include interest calculated based on the rates in effect at December 31, 2009, however, the obligations do not reflect potential prepayments that may be required under DIRECTV U.S. senior secured credit facility, if any, or permitted under its indentures. (b)Purchase obligations consist primarily of broadcast programming commitments, regional professional team rights agreements, service contract commitments and satellite launch contracts. Broadcast programming commitments include guaranteed minimum contractual commitments that are typically based on a flat fee or a minimum number of required subscribers subscribing to the related programming. Actual payments may exceed the minimum payment requirements if the actual number of subscribers subscribing to the related programming exceeds the minimum amounts. Service contract commitments include minimum commitments for the purchase of services that have been outsourced to third parties, such as billing services, telemetry, tracking and control services and broadcast center services. In most cases, actual payments, which are typically based on volume, usually exceed these minimum amounts. (c)Certain of the operating leases contain escalation clauses and renewal or purchase options, which we do not consider in the amounts disclosed. (d)Payments due by period for other long term liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under GAAP do not include payments that could be made related to our net unrecognized tax benefits liability, which amounted to $367 million as of December 31, 2009. The timing and amount of any future payments is not reasonably estimable, as such payments are dependent on the completion and resolution of examinations with tax authorities. We do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations within the next twelve months. (e)Excluded from these obligations are the $1,202 million Collar Loan and the related $400 million equity collars. During the first quarter of 2010, we paid the remaining principal balance of the loan and settled the equity collars. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2009, we were contingently liable under standby letters of credit and bonds in the aggregate amount of $35 million primarily related to insurance deductibles. 67 Table of Contents DIRECTV CONTINGENCIES For a discussion of "Contingencies", see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS For a discussion of "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions," see Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported for future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represents what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Multi Year Programming Contracts for Live Sporting Events. We charge the cost of multi year programming contracts for live sporting events with minimum guarantee payments, such as DIRECTV U.S. agreement with the NFL, based on the contractual rates in the contract per season, unless the contractual rates are inconsistent with the relative value of the programming from season to season, in which case we record the expense based on the ratio of each periods sports programming package revenues to the estimated total package revenues to be earned over the contract period. Management evaluates estimated total programming package revenues at least annually. Estimates of forecasted revenues rely on assumptions regarding the number of subscribers to a given sporting events package and the estimated package price throughout the contract. While we base our estimates on past experience and other relevant factors, actual results could differ from our estimates. If actual results were to significantly vary from forecasted amounts, the profit recorded on such contracts in a future period could vary from current rates and the resulting change in profits recorded could be material to our consolidated results of operations. Income Taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining provisions for income taxes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, tax benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets at each reporting date and where applicable, record a valuation allowance to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized in the future. Our assessment includes an analysis of whether deferred tax assets will be realized in the ordinary course of operations based on the available positive and negative evidence, including the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and forecasted income from operating activities. The underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment. In the event that actual income from operating activities differs from forecasted amounts, or if we change our estimates of forecasted income from operating activities, we could record additional charges or reduce allowances in order to adjust the carrying value of deferred tax assets to their realizable amount. Such adjustments could be material to our consolidated financial statements. 68 Table of Contents DIRECTV In addition, the recognition of a tax benefit for tax positions involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We provide for taxes for uncertain tax positions where assessments have not been received. We believe such tax reserves are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, we adjust these amounts only when more information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. Future events such as changes in the facts or law, judicial decisions regarding the application of existing law or a favorable audit outcome will result in changes to the amounts provided. Contingent Matters. Determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingent matter, including but not limited to legal and tax issues, and the amount of such accrual, if any, requires a significant amount of management judgment and estimation. We develop our judgments and estimates in consultation with outside counsel based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter, we could record a charge in a future period that would be material to our consolidated financial statements. Depreciable Lives of Leased Set Top Receivers. We currently lease most set top receivers provided to new and existing subscribers and therefore capitalize the cost of those set top receivers. We depreciate capitalized set top receivers at DIRECTV U.S. over a three year estimated useful life, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Changes in the estimated useful lives of set top receivers capitalized could result in significant changes to the amounts recorded as depreciation expense. Based on the book value of the DIRECTV U.S. set top receivers capitalized as of December 31, 2009, if we extended the depreciable life of the set top receivers by one half of a year, it would result in an approximately $200 million reduction in annual depreciation expense. Valuation of Long Lived Assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We consider the carrying value of a long lived asset impaired when the anticipated undiscounted future cash flow from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset. We determine fair value primarily using the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved, and other valuation techniques. We determine losses on long lived assets to be disposed of in a similar manner, except that we reduce the fair value for the cost of disposal. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances change that would more likely than not result in an impairment loss. We completed our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2009, and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives. As of December 31, 2009, the fair value of each reporting unit and our intangible assets with indefinite lives significantly exceed their carrying values. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. The goodwill evaluation requires the estimation of the fair value of reporting units where we record goodwill. We determine fair values primarily using estimated cash flows discounted at a rate 69 Table of Contents DIRECTV commensurate with the risk involved, when appropriate. Estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgment about future operating results, and can vary significantly from one evaluation to the next. Risk adjusted discount rates are not fixed and are subject to change over time. As a result, changes in estimated future cash flows and or changes in discount rates could result in a write down of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For a discussion of accounting changes and new accounting pronouncements see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. SECURITY RATINGS Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due and expected loss given a default. Ratings in the Baa range for Moodys Investors Service, and the BBB range for Standard & Poors Ratings Services, or S&P, and the BBB range for Fitch Ratings, generally indicate adequate current protection of interest payments and principal security, with certain protective elements lacking. Ratings in the Ba range for Moodys and the BB range for S&P and Fitch, generally indicate moderate protection of interest and principal payments, potentially outweighed by exposure to uncertainties or adverse conditions. In general, lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Currently, DIRECTV has the following security rating: Corporate Outlook Standard & Poors BBB Stable Currently, DIRECTV U.S. has the following security ratings: Senior Secured Senior Unsecured Corporate Outlook Standard & Poors BBB BBB BBB Stable Moodys Baa2 Ba2 Ba1 Stable Fitch BBB BBB BBB Stable *** 70  Table of Contents DIRECTV ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses referred to below include forward looking statements of market risk which assume for analytical purposes that certain adverse market conditions may occur. Actual future market conditions may differ materially from such assumptions and the amounts noted below are the result of analyses used for the purpose of assessing possible risks and the mitigation thereof. Accordingly, you should not consider the forward looking statements as our projections of future events or losses. General Our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and changes in the market value of our equity investments. We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet our risk management objectives, and do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Risk We generally conduct our business in U.S. dollars with some business conducted in a variety of foreign currencies and therefore we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Accordingly, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, commitments and anticipated foreign currency transactions. The gains and losses on derivative foreign exchange contracts offset changes in value of the related exposures. As of December 31, 2009, we had no significant foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding. The impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in exchange rates on our net assets would be a loss of $109 million, net of taxes, at December 31, 2009, a significant portion of which would be recorded in "Foreign currency translation activity during the period" in our Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity. Interest Rate Risk We are subject to fluctuating interest rates, which may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. We had outstanding debt of $8,010 million at December 31, 2009, which consisted of DIRECTV U.S. fixed rate borrowings of $4,490 million, collar loan of $1,202 million and variable rate borrowings of $2,316 million. As of December 31, 2009, a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates related to our outstanding variable rate debt would have increased our annual interest expense by approximately $23 million. *** 71  Table of Contents DIRECTV
