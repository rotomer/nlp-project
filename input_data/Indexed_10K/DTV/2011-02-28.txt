ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSE OF THE "SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This Annual Report on Form 10 K may contain certain statements that we believe are, or may be considered to be, "forward looking statements" within the meaning of various provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward looking statements generally can be identified by use of statements that include phrases such as we "believe," "expect," "estimate," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "project" or other similar references to future periods. Examples of forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make related to our business strategy and regarding our outlook for 2011 financial results, liquidity and capital resources. Forward looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include economic, business, competitive, national or global political, market and regulatory conditions and other risks, each of which is described in more detail in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report. Any forward looking statement made by us in this Annual Report on Form 10 K speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may occur and it is not possible for us to predict them all. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. CONTENTS The following is a discussion of our results of operations and financial condition.

This measure should be used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures and is not presented as an alternative measure of operating results, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our management and our Board of Directors use operating profit before depreciation and amortization to evaluate the operating performance of our company and our business segments and to allocate resources and capital to business segments. This metric is also used as a measure of performance for incentive 35 Table of Contents DIRECTV  SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION (continued) compensation purposes and to measure income generated from operations that could be used to fund capital expenditures, service debt or pay taxes. Depreciation and amortization expense primarily represents an allocation to current expense of the cost of historical capital expenditures and for acquired intangible assets resulting from prior business acquisitions. To compensate for the exclusion of depreciation and amortization expense from operating profit, our management and our Board of Directors separately measure and budget for capital expenditures and business acquisitions. We believe this measure is useful to investors, along with GAAP measures (such as revenues, operating profit and net income), to compare our operating performance to other communications, entertainment and media service providers. We believe that investors use current and projected operating profit before depreciation and amortization and similar measures to estimate our current or prospective enterprise value and make investment decisions. This metric provides investors with a means to compare operating results exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. Our management believes this is useful given the significant variation in depreciation and amortization expense that can result from the timing of capital expenditures, the capitalization of intangible assets, potential variations in expected useful lives when compared to other companies and periodic changes to estimated useful lives. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin is calculated by dividing operating profit before depreciation and amortization by Revenues. (2)Free cash flow, which is a financial measure that is not determined in accordance with GAAP, can be calculated by deducting amounts under the captions "Cash paid for property and equipment" and "Cash paid for satellites" from "Net cash provided by operating activities" from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This financial measure should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures and is not presented as an alternative measure of cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our management and our Board of Directors use free cash flow to evaluate the cash generated by our current subscriber base, net of capital expenditures, for the purpose of allocating resources to activities such as adding new subscribers, retaining and upgrading existing subscribers, for additional capital expenditures and other capital investments or transactions and as a measure of performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe this measure is useful to investors, along with other GAAP measures (such as cash flows from operating and investing activities), to compare our operating performance to other communications, entertainment and media companies. We believe that investors also use current and projected free cash flow to determine the ability of revenues from our current and projected subscriber base to fund required and discretionary spending and to help determine our financial value. 36 Table of Contents DIRECTV  SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION (concluded)  Selected Segment Data Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. Revenues $ 20,268 $ 18,671 $ 17,310 % of total revenues 84.1 % 86.6 % 87.9 % Operating profit $ 3,290 $ 2,410 $ 2,330 Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 1,926 2,275 2,061 Operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 5,216 $ 4,685 $ 4,391 Operating profit margin 16.2 % 12.9 % 13.5 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin 25.7 % 25.1 % 25.4 % Segment assets $ 11,400 $ 12,408 $ 12,546 Capital expenditures 1,557 1,485 1,765 DIRECTV Latin America Revenues $ 3,597 $ 2,878 $ 2,383 % of total revenues 14.9 % 13.3 % 12.1 % Operating profit $ 623 $ 331 $ 426 Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 541 366 264 Operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 1,164 $ 697 $ 690 Operating profit margin 17.3 % 11.5 % 17.9 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin 32.4 % 24.2 % 29.0 % Segment assets $ 4,696 $ 3,772 $ 3,301 Capital expenditures 857 584 447 Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other Revenues $ 237 $ 16 % of total revenues 1.0 % 0.1 % Operating loss $ (17 ) $ (68 ) $ (61 ) Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 15 (1 ) (5 ) Operating loss before depreciation and amortization $ (2 ) $ (69 ) $ (66 ) Segment assets $ 1,813 $ 2,080 $ 692 Capital expenditures 2 2 17 Total Revenues $ 24,102 $ 21,565 $ 19,693 Operating profit $ 3,896 $ 2,673 $ 2,695 Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 2,482 2,640 2,320 Operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 6,378 $ 5,313 $ 5,015 Operating profit margin 16.2 % 12.4 % 13.7 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin 26.5 % 24.6 % 25.5 % Total assets $ 17,909 $ 18,260 $ 16,539 Capital expenditures 2,416 2,071 2,229 37  Table of Contents DIRECTV SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING THE COMPARABILITY OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Malone Transaction In order to resolve a condition imposed by the FCC on Liberty Medias acquisition of an ownership interest in us from News Corporation in 2008, which we refer to as the "Puerto Rico Condition", on April 6, 2010, we entered into an agreement with Dr. John C. Malone which severed all attributable interests in satisfaction of the requirements of the FCC order. Under the terms of the agreement, the Malones exchanged 21.8 million shares of high vote DIRECTV Class B common stock, which were all of the outstanding DIRECTV Class B shares, for 26.5 million shares of DIRECTV Class A common stock, resulting in the reduction of the Malones voting interest in DIRECTV from approximately 24.3% to approximately 3%. We accounted for the exchange of DIRECTV Class B common stock into DIRECTV Class A common stock pursuant to accounting standards for induced conversions, whereby the $160 million in incremental DIRECTV Class A common stock issued to the former DIRECTV Class B stockholders has been deducted from earnings attributable to DIRECTV Class A stockholders for purposes of calculating earnings per share in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This adjustment had the effect of reducing diluted earnings per DIRECTV Class A common share by $0.18 for the year ended December 31, 2010. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Part II of this Annual Report for additional information. Acquisitions Globo Transaction. In connection with our acquisition of Sky Brazil in 2006, Globo was granted the right, until January 2014, to require us to purchase all or a portion (but not less than half) of its 25.9% interest in Sky Brazil. In June 2010, Globo notified us that it was exercising its right to exchange 178,830,000 shares representing approximately 19% of the ownership interests in Sky Brazil. The fair value of the approximate 19% interest was determined to be $605 million by an independent investment bank according to a process specified by Globo and us in the related agreement. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we paid cash for the approximate 19% ownership interest, which was recorded as a reduction to "Redeemable noncontrolling interest" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We and our subsidiaries now own approximately 93% of Sky Brazil and Globo retains the right to sell its remaining 7% interest to us until January 2014 as discussed in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Part II of this Annual Report. Liberty Transaction. On November 19, 2009, The DIRECTV Group, Inc., or DIRECTV Group, and Liberty Media Corporation, which we refer to as Liberty or Liberty Media, obtained shareholder approval of and closed a series of related transactions which we refer to collectively as the Liberty Transaction. The Liberty Transaction included the split off of certain of the assets of the Liberty Entertainment group into Liberty Entertainment, Inc., or LEI, which was then split off from Liberty. Following the split off, DIRECTV Group and LEI merged with subsidiaries of DIRECTV. As a result of Liberty Transaction, DIRECTV Group, which is comprised of the DIRECTV U.S. and DIRECTV Latin America businesses, and LEI, which held Libertys 57% interest in DIRECTV Group, a 100% interest in three regional sports networks, a 65% interest in Game Show Network, LLC, approximately $120 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $2.1 billion of indebtedness and a series of related equity collars became wholly owned subsidiaries of DIRECTV. The assets, liabilities and results of operations of LEI have been consolidated beginning on the acquisition date, November 19, 2009. As part of the Liberty Transaction, we assumed a credit facility with a principal balance of $1,878 million, which we refer to as the Collar Loan, and a series of related equity collars which were in a liability position with an estimated acquisition date fair value of $369 million. During 2009, we repaid a total of $751 million, including $676 million in principal payments and $75 million in payments to settle a portion of the equity collars. During 2010, we repaid $1,537 million, including $1,202 million of remaining principal payments and $335 million to settle the equity collars. Cash paid, net of cash acquired in connection with the transaction was $97 million and includes a $226 million repayment of LEIs existing loan from Liberty at the close of the transaction and $43 million of cash paid for transaction costs, partially offset by $120 million in cash at LEI, and $56 million of cash at the regional sports networks. 38 Table of Contents DIRECTV As a result of the Liberty Transaction, we recorded $491 million in charges to "Liberty transaction and related gains (charges)" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, which is comprised of: a $337 million charge related to a premium paid to LEI shareholders to complete the merger in the form of an equity interest that exceeded the fair value of net assets acquired by DIRECTV; $43 million of costs incurred to complete the transaction, including legal, accounting, financial printing, investment banking and other costs; and $111 million in net losses recorded for the partial settlement of the equity collars and stock options and stock appreciation rights held by Liberty employees subsequent to the acquisition date, and adjustments of the equity collars and stock options and stock appreciation rights carried as liabilities to fair value as of December 31, 2009. We recorded a $67 million net gain in "Liberty transaction and related gains (charges)" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the final settlement of the equity collars during 2010. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. 180 Connect. In July 2008, we acquired 100% of 180 Connects outstanding common stock and exchangeable shares. Simultaneously, in a separate transaction, UniTek USA, LLC acquired 100% of 180 Connects cable service operating unit and operations in certain of our installation services markets in exchange for satellite installation operations in certain markets and $7 million in cash. These transactions provide us with ownership and control over a significant portion of DIRECTV U.S. home service provider network. We paid $91 million in cash, net of the $7 million we received from UniTek USA, for the acquisition, including the equity purchase price, repayment of assumed debt and related transaction costs. Financing Transactions In 2010, DIRECTV U.S. issued $6.0 billion of senior notes resulting in $5,978 million of proceeds, net of discount, and repaid the $2,205 million of remaining principal on the Term Loans of its senior secured credit facility. The repayment of the Term Loans resulted in a 2010 pre tax charge recorded in "Other, net" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations of $16 million, $10 million after tax, resulting from the write off of deferred debt issuance and other transaction costs. In 2009, DIRECTV U.S. issued $2.0 billion of senior notes resulting in $1,990 million of proceeds, net of discount. Also in 2009, DIRECTV U.S. purchased and redeemed its then outstanding $910 million 8.375% senior notes, resulting in a 2009 pre tax charge of $34 million, $21 million after tax, of which $29 million resulted from a premium paid for the redemption and $5 million resulted from the write off of deferred debt issuance costs and other transaction costs. The charge was recorded in "Other, net" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In 2008, DIRECTV U.S. issued $1.5 billion in senior notes, and borrowed $1 billion under a new Term Loan of its senior secured credit facility, resulting in proceeds, net of discount, of $2,490 million. Venezuela Exchange Controls In January 2010, the Venezuelan government announced the creation of a dual exchange rate system, including an exchange rate of 4.3 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar for most of the activities of our Venezuelan operations compared to an exchange rate of 2.15 Venezuelan bolivars fuerte prior to the announcement. As a result of this devaluation, we recorded a $6 million charge to net income in the year ended December 31, 2010 related to the adjustment of net bolivars fuerte denominated monetary assets to the new official exchange rate. We began reporting the operating results of our Venezuelan subsidiary in the first quarter of 2010 using the devalued rate of 4.3 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar. In December 2010, the Venezuelan government announced the elimination of the dual exchange rate system, eliminating the 2.6 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar preferential rate which was available for certain activities. Companies operating in Venezuela are required to obtain Venezuelan government approval to exchange bolivars fuerte into U.S. dollars at the official rate. We have not been able to consistently exchange Venezuelan bolivars fuerte into U.S. dollars at the official rate and as a result, we have relied on a parallel exchange process to settle U.S. dollar obligations and to repatriate accumulated cash balances prior to its close. The rates implied by transactions in the parallel market, which was closed in May, 2010, were significantly higher than the official rate (6 to 7 bolivars fuerte per U.S. 39 Table of Contents DIRECTV dollar). As a result, we recorded a $22 million charge in 2010, a $213 million charge in 2009 and a $29 million charge in 2008 in "General and administrative expenses" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in connection with the exchange of accumulated Venezuelan cash balances to U.S. dollars using the parallel exchange process. As a result of the closing of the parallel exchange process in May 2010, we have been unable to repatriate excess cash balances and we therefore realized lower charges for the repatriation of cash in 2010 and our Venezuelan subsidiary had Venezuelan bolivar fuerte denominated cash of $169 million at December 31, 2010, as compared to $33 million at December 31, 2009, based on the official exchange rate. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for additional information. Sky Brazil Functional Currency Based on cumulatively significant changes in economic facts and circumstances, we determined that the local Brazilian currency should be the functional currency of Sky Brazil for purposes of financial statement translation beginning in the second quarter of 2009. As a result of this change in functional currency, changes in exchange rates result in gain or losses, which we record in "Other, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the revaluation of U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities, such as cash deposits, notes payable and capital lease obligations held by Sky Brazil. Other Than Temporary Impairment In 2009, we recognized a $45 million charge for the other than temporary impairment of certain of our investments in "Other, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Share Repurchase Program Since 2006 our Board of Directors approved multiple authorizations for the repurchase of our common stock. The following table sets forth information regarding shares repurchased and retired for the years ended December 31: 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Total cost of repurchased and retired shares $ 5,179 $ 1,696 $ 3,174 Average price per share 38.20 23.79 24.12 Number of shares repurchased and retired 136 71 131 KEY TERMINOLOGY Revenues. We earn revenues mostly from monthly fees we charge subscribers for subscriptions to basic and premium channel programming, HD programming and access fees, pay per view programming, and seasonal and live sporting events. We also earn revenues from monthly fees that we charge subscribers with multiple non leased set top receivers (which we refer to as mirroring fees), monthly fees we charge subscribers for leased set top receivers, monthly fees we charge subscribers for digital video recorder, or DVR, service, hardware revenues from subscribers who lease or purchase set top receivers from us, our published programming guide, warranty service fees and advertising services. Revenues are reported net of customer credits and discounted promotions. Broadcast Programming and Other. These costs primarily include license fees for subscription service programming, pay per view programming, live sports and other events. Other costs include expenses associated with the publication and distribution of our programming guide, continuing service fees paid to third parties for active subscribers, warranty service costs and production costs for on air advertisements we sell to third parties. Subscriber Service Expenses. Subscriber service expenses include the costs of customer call centers, billing, remittance processing and certain home services expenses, such as in home repair costs. Broadcast Operations Expenses. These expenses include broadcast center operating costs, signal transmission expenses (including costs of collecting signals for our local channel offerings), and costs of monitoring, 40 Table of Contents DIRECTV maintaining and insuring our satellites. Also included are engineering expenses associated with deterring theft of our signal. Subscriber Acquisition Costs. These costs include the cost of set top receivers and other equipment, commissions we pay to national retailers, independent satellite television retailers, dealers and telcos, and the cost of installation, advertising, marketing and customer call center expenses associated with the acquisition of new subscribers. Set top receivers leased to new subscribers are capitalized in "Property and equipment, net" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciated over their useful lives. The amount of set top receivers capitalized each period for subscriber acquisitions is included in "Cash paid for property and equipment" in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Upgrade and Retention Costs. Upgrade and retention costs are associated with upgrade efforts for existing subscribers that we believe will result in higher average monthly revenue per subscriber, or ARPU, and lower churn. Our upgrade efforts include subscriber equipment upgrade programs for DVR, HD and HD DVR receivers and local channels, our multiple set top receiver offer and similar initiatives. Retention costs also include the costs of installing and providing hardware under our movers program for subscribers relocating to a new residence. Set top receivers leased to existing subscribers under upgrade and retention programs are capitalized in "Property and equipment, net" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciated over their useful lives. The amount of set top receivers capitalized each period for upgrade and retention programs is included in "Cash paid for property and equipment" in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include departmental costs for legal, administrative services, finance, marketing and information technology. These costs also include expenses for bad debt and other operating expenses, such as legal settlements, and gains or losses from the sale or disposal of fixed assets. Average Monthly Revenue Per Subscriber. We calculate ARPU by dividing average monthly revenues for the period (total revenues during the period divided by the number of months in the period) by average subscribers for the period. We calculate average subscribers for the period by adding the number of subscribers as of the beginning of the period and for each quarter end in the current year or period and dividing by the sum of the number of quarters in the period plus one. Average Monthly Subscriber Churn. Average monthly subscriber churn represents the number of subscribers whose service is disconnected, expressed as a percentage of the average total number of subscribers. We calculate average monthly subscriber churn by dividing the average monthly number of disconnected subscribers for the period (total subscribers disconnected, net of reconnects, during the period divided by the number of months in the period) by average subscribers for the period. Subscriber Count. The total number of subscribers represents the total number of subscribers actively subscribing to our service, including seasonal subscribers, subscribers who are in the process of relocating and commercial equivalent viewing units. In March 2008, we implemented a change in DIRECTV U.S. commercial pricing and packaging to increase our competitiveness. As a result, during the first quarter of 2008, DIRECTV U.S. made a one time downward adjustment to the subscriber count of approximately 71,000 subscribers related to commercial equivalent viewing units. SAC. We calculate SAC, which represents total subscriber acquisition costs stated on a per subscriber basis, by dividing total subscriber acquisition costs for the period by the number of gross new subscribers acquired during the period. We calculate total subscriber acquisition costs for the period by adding together "Subscriber acquisition costs" expensed during the period and the amount of cash paid for equipment leased to new subscribers during the period. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK The United States and the other countries in which we operate are continuing to undergo a period of economic uncertainty. As discussed in "Competition" in Item 1, in addition to cable and satellite system operators, we are experiencing increasing competition from telcos and other emerging digital media distribution providers. Please refer to "Risk Factors" in Item 1A for a further discussion of risks which may affect forecasted results or our business generally. 41 Table of Contents DIRECTV DIRECTV U.S. Our revenue growth is generated by both increases in the average monthly rates we earn from subscribers, or ARPU, and increases in the total number of subscribers. In 2011, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digit percentage range. In 2011, we expect that the anticipated growth in revenues will be partially offset by higher programming costs, including the costs associated with our contract with the NFL, resulting in operating profit before depreciation and amortization growth in the low to mid single digit percentage range. In 2011, we expect capital expenditures to be slightly higher than in 2010. DIRECTV Latin America. In 2011, we expect revenue and operating profit before depreciation and amortization growth of approximately 20%. In 2011, we expect capital expenditures in Latin America to exceed 2010 capital expenditures due to higher gross subscriber additions, increased sales of advanced products and other infrastructure projects. DIRECTV. At the consolidated DIRECTV level, we anticipate 2011 free cash flow, or cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to be lower than in 2010. The anticipated improvement in operating profit before depreciation and amortization is expected to be offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes, higher capital expenditures and higher expected interest expense. Diluted earnings per common share is expected to grow in 2011 as a result of the anticipated growth in income from continuing operations resulting from higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization, lower depreciation and amortization and a continued decline in weighted average common shares outstanding due to anticipated share repurchases, partially offset by increased income tax and interest expense. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Consolidated Results of Operations We discuss changes for each of our segments in more detail below. Revenues. The following table presents our revenues by segment: Revenues by segment: Change 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 20,268 $ 18,671 $ 1,597 8.6 % DIRECTV Latin America 3,597 2,878 719 25.0 % Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other 237 16 221 NM * Total Revenues $ 24,102 $ 21,565 $ 2,537 11.8 % *Percentage not meaningful. The increase in our total revenues was due to subscriber growth and higher ARPU at DIRECTV U.S., subscriber growth at DIRECTV Latin America, as well as the revenue generated by DIRECTV Sports Networks which we acquired in November 2009. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization. The following table presents our operating profit (loss) before depreciation and amortization by segment: Operating profit (loss) before depreciation and amortization by segment: Change 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 5,216 $ 4,685 $ 531 11.3 % DIRECTV Latin America 1,164 697 467 67.0 % Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other (2 ) (69 ) 67 NM Total operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 6,378 $ 5,313 $ 1,065 20.0 % 42 Table of Contents DIRECTV The increase in total operating profit before depreciation and amortization was due to higher gross profit from the increase in revenues, lower charges in 2010 for foreign currency transactions at DIRECTV Latin America, offset by higher subscriber acquisition costs and upgrade and retention costs at both DIRECTV U.S and DIRECTV Latin America and higher general and administrative expenses at DIRECTV U.S. Operating profit. The following table presents our operating profit (loss) by segment: Operating profit (loss) by segment: Change 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 3,290 $ 2,410 $ 880 36.5 % DIRECTV Latin America 623 331 292 88.2 % Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other (17 ) (68 ) 51 NM Total operating profit $ 3,896 $ 2,673 $ 1,223 45.8 % The increase in our operating profit was primarily due to the changes in operating profit before depreciation and amortization discussed above and lower depreciation and amortization expense at DIRECTV U.S. due to the completion of amortization of intangible assets and declining subscriber equipment capitalization, partially offset by increased depreciation at DIRECTV Latin America due to increased subscriber equipment capitalization. Interest income. Interest income was $39 million in 2010 and $41 million in 2009. Interest expense. The increase in interest expense to $557 million in 2010 from $423 million in 2009 was due to an increase in the average debt balances compared to 2009, partially offset by decreased interest rates. We capitalized interest costs of $6 million in 2010 and $18 million in 2009. Liberty transaction and related gains (charges). In 2010, we recorded a $67 million net gain from the settlement of the equity collars and debt assumed as part of the Liberty Transaction. In 2009 we incurred $491 million in costs related to the Liberty Transaction, which is comprised of a $337 million premium paid to LEI shareholders, $111 million in net losses for the partial settlement and fair value adjustments related to the equity collars and non employee stock options and stock appreciation rights and $43 million of charges for transaction related costs. Other, net. The significant components of "Other, net" were as follows: 2010 2009 Change (Dollars in Millions) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries $ 90 $ 51 $ 39 Net foreign currency transaction gain 11 62 (51 ) Loss from impairment of investments (45 ) 45 Fair value adjustment loss on non employee stock options (11 ) (11 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt (16 ) (34 ) 18 Net gain from sale of investments 6 6 Other (11 ) (11 ) Total $ 69 $ 34 $ 35 In 2010, Other, net increased due primarily to increased equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries due to our investment in GSN, the recognition of a charge for the other than temporary impairment of investments in 2009, and reduced losses on the early extinguishment of debt in 2010, partially offset by lower foreign currency transaction gain related to net U.S. dollar denominated liabilities held by Sky Brazil and fair value adjustment loss on non employee stock options in connection with the Liberty Transaction completed in 2009. Income tax expense. The increase of income tax expense to $1,202 million in 2010 from $827 million in 2009 is primarily due to an increase in income before taxes, partially offset by tax benefits associated with the release of valuation allowances in certain foreign subsidiaries, multi state income tax planning and recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. The increase was also offset by higher tax expense in the prior year primarily attributable to the non deductibility of the Liberty Transaction charge for tax purposes. Noncontrolling interests in net earnings of subsidiaries. We recognized noncontrolling interest in net earnings of subsidiaries of $114 million in 43 Table of Contents DIRECTV 2010 and $65 million in 2009 at Sky Brazil. Noncontrolling interest in net earnings of subsidiaries in 2010 increased due to higher net income at Sky Brazil and a net tax benefit attributable to the noncontrolling interest resulting from the release of a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance. Earnings Per Share. Class A common stock earnings per share (DIRECTV Group common stock for the period January 1, 2009 through November 19, 2009) and weighted shares outstanding were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2010 2009 (Shares in Millions) Basic earnings attributable to DIRECTV Class A common stockholders per common share $ 2.31 $ 0.96 Diluted earnings attributable to DIRECTV Class A common stockholders per common share 2.30 0.95 Weighted average number of Class A common shares outstanding Basic 870 982 Diluted 876 989 The increases in basic and diluted earnings per share for Class A common stock were due to higher net income attributable to DIRECTV, the charge recorded for the Liberty Transaction in 2009 and a reduction in weighted shares outstanding resulting from our share repurchase program and the effect of the Liberty Transaction, partially offset by the $160 million inducement in 2010 paid in connection with the Malone Transaction. DIRECTV U.S. Segment The following table provides operating results and a summary of key subscriber data for the DIRECTV U.S. segment: Change 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Subscriber Amounts) Revenues $ 20,268 $ 18,671 $ 1,597 8.6 % Operating costs and expenses Costs of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense Broadcast programming and other 8,699 8,027 672 8.4 % Subscriber service expenses 1,340 1,268 72 5.7 % Broadcast operations expenses 273 274 (1 ) (0.4 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense Subscriber acquisition costs 2,631 2,478 153 6.2 % Upgrade and retention costs 1,106 1,045 61 5.8 % General and administrative expenses 1,003 894 109 12.2 % Depreciation and amortization expense 1,926 2,275 (349 ) (15.3 )% Total operating costs and expenses 16,978 16,261 717 4.4 % Operating profit $ 3,290 $ 2,410 $ 880 36.5 % Other data: Operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 5,216 $ 4,685 $ 531 11.3 % Total number of subscribers (000s) 19,223 18,560 663 3.6 % ARPU $ 89.71 $ 85.48 $ 4.23 4.9 % Average monthly subscriber churn % 1.53 % 1.53 % 0.0 % Gross subscriber additions (000s) 4,124 4,273 (149 ) (3.5 )% Subscriber disconnections (000s) 3,461 3,334 127 3.8 % Net subscriber additions (000s) 663 939 (276 ) (29.4 )% Average subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber (SAC) $ 796 $ 712 $ 84 11.8 % Subscribers. In 2010, gross subscriber additions decreased primarily due to the impact of the transition to digital broadcast in 2009 and lower additions from our regional telco partners as a result of a more challenging 44 Table of Contents DIRECTV competitive environment. Net subscriber additions decreased from 2009 due to the decrease in gross additions and higher subscriber disconnections associated with the larger subscriber base. Average monthly subscriber churn remained unchanged from 1.53% in 2009. Revenues. Our revenues increased as a result of higher ARPU and the larger subscriber base. The increase in ARPU resulted primarily from price increases on programming packages, higher HD and DVR service fees. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization. The improvement of operating profit before depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the gross profit generated from the higher revenues, partially offset by higher subscriber acquisition and upgrade and retention costs and higher general and administrative expenses. Broadcast programming and other costs increased due to the larger number of subscribers in 2010 and annual program supplier rate increases. Subscriber service expenses increased primarily due to a larger subscriber base in 2010 and costs associated with service quality improvement initiatives. Subscriber acquisition costs increased from 2009 primarily due to higher subscriber demand for advanced products as well as increased dealer commissions. SAC per subscriber, which includes the cost of capitalized set top receivers, increased primarily due to higher subscriber demand for advanced products and increased dealer commissions compared to 2009. Under our lease program, we capitalized $651 million of set top receivers in 2010 and $564 million in 2009 for new subscriber acquisitions. Upgrade and retention costs increased in 2010 due to increased marketing costs and costs related to advanced product upgrades. Under our lease program we capitalized $316 million of set top receivers in 2010 and $419 million in 2009 for subscriber upgrades. The decrease in the capitalized amount of set top receivers is due to a decrease in the cost of advanced products. General and administrative expenses increased in 2010 primarily due to increased labor and benefit costs related to higher incentive compensation and increased headcount as well as higher bad debt expense associated with higher revenue. Operating profit. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization and lower depreciation and amortization expense in 2010 as a result of decreased subscriber equipment capitalization and completion of the amortization of subscriber related and orbital slot intangible assets. DIRECTV Latin America Segment The following table provides operating results and a summary of key subscriber data for the DIRECTV Latin America segment: Change 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Subscriber Amounts) Revenues $ 3,597 $ 2,878 $ 719 25.0 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization 1,164 697 467 67.0 % Operating profit 623 331 292 88.2 % Other data: ARPU $ 57.95 $ 57.12 $ 0.83 1.5 % Average monthly subscriber churn % 1.77 % 1.75 % 1.1 % Total number of subscribers (000s) (1) 5,808 4,588 1,220 26.6 % Gross subscriber additions (000s) 2,318 1,575 743 47.2 % Net subscriber additions (000s) 1,220 692 528 76.3 % (1)DIRECTV Latin America subscriber data exclude subscribers of the Sky Mexico platform. Net subscriber additions and churn exclude the effect of the migration of approximately 3,000 subscribers to Sky Mexico and the migration of approximately 16,000 subscribers from a local pay television service provider to Sky Brazil in 2009. Gross subscriber additions increased in 2010 principally due to continued strong demand for advanced products and prepaid services, the effect of the FIFA World Cup soccer tournament as well as targeted customer promotions aimed at the middle market segments. The increase in net subscriber additions was due to higher gross subscriber additions primarily in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador and Chile. 45 Table of Contents DIRECTV Revenues increased in 2010 primarily due to strong subscriber growth. ARPU increased mainly due to price increases and higher fees for HD and DVR services, partially offset by the effect of the devaluation in Venezuela and the increased penetration of the middle market segment. The higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization was primarily from the increased gross profit generated from the higher revenues, coupled with lower general and administrative expenses primarily due to a decrease of $191 million in the charges related to the exchange of Venezuelan currency. This was partially offset by an increase in subscriber acquisition costs due to a higher number of gross subscriber additions. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from an increase in basic and advanced product receivers capitalized related to the higher gross subscriber additions attained over the last year. Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other Operating loss from Sports Networks, Elimination and Other decreased to $17 million in 2010 from $68 million in 2009. Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other primarily consisted of corporate operating costs until November 19, 2009 when we completed the Liberty Transaction and acquired the RSNs. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Consolidated Results of Operations We discuss changes for each of our segments in more detail below. Revenues. The following table presents our revenues by segment: Revenues by segment: Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 18,671 $ 17,310 $ 1,361 7.9 % DIRECTV Latin America 2,878 2,383 495 20.8 % Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other 16 16 NM Total Revenues $ 21,565 $ 19,693 $ 1,872 9.5 % The increase in our total revenues was due to subscriber growth and higher ARPU at DIRECTV U.S. and DIRECTV Latin America. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization. The following table presents our operating profit (loss) before depreciation and amortization by segment: Operating profit (loss) before depreciation and amortization by segment: Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 4,685 $ 4,391 $ 294 6.7 % DIRECTV Latin America 697 690 7 1.0 % Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other (69 ) (66 ) (3 ) 4.5 % Total operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 5,313 $ 5,015 $ 298 5.9 % The increase in total operating profit before depreciation and amortization was due to higher gross profit from the increase in revenues, partially offset by higher subscriber acquisition, upgrade and retention and general and administrative costs at both DIRECTV U.S. and DIRECTV Latin America. 46  Table of Contents DIRECTV Operating profit. The following table presents our operating profit (loss) by segment: Operating profit (loss) by segment: Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 2,410 $ 2,330 $ 80 3.4 % DIRECTV Latin America 331 426 (95 ) (22.3 )% Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other (68 ) (61 ) (7 ) 11.5 % Total operating profit $ 2,673 $ 2,695 $ (22 ) (0.8 )% The decrease in our operating profit was primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization from the DIRECTV U.S. and DIRECTV Latin America set top receiver lease programs, more than offsetting our increase in operating profit before depreciation and amortization. Interest income. The decrease in interest income to $41 million in 2009 from $81 million in 2008 was due to lower interest rates and lower average cash balances due mostly to the use of cash to fund our share repurchase program. Interest expense. The increase in interest expense to $423 million in 2009 from $360 million in 2008 was due to an increase in the average debt balance compared to 2008, partially offset by decreased interest rates. We capitalized $18 million of interest costs in both 2009 and 2008. Liberty transaction and related gains (charges). In 2009 we incurred $491 million in costs related to the Liberty Transaction, which is comprised of a $337 premium paid to LEI shareholders, $111 million in net losses for the partial settlement and fair value adjustments related to the equity collars and non employee stock options and stock appreciation rights and $43 million of charges for transaction related costs. Other, net. The significant components of "Other, net" were as follows: 2009 2008 Change (Dollars in Millions) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries $ 51 $ 55 $ (4 ) Net foreign currency transaction gain 62 62 Loss from impairment of investments (45 ) (45 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt (34 ) (34 ) Net gain (loss) from sale of investments 1 (1 ) Other (1 ) 1 Total $ 34 $ 55 $ (21 ) In 2009, Other, net decreased due primarily to the recognition of a charge for the other than temporary impairment of investments, a loss on the early extinguishment of our 8.375% senior notes and decreased earnings from our unconsolidated subsidiaries, partially offset by a foreign currency transaction gain related to net U.S. dollar denominated liabilities held by Sky Brazil. Income tax expense. The increase in the effective tax rate to 45% in 2009 from 35% in 2008 is primarily attributable to the non recoverability of Liberty Transaction related charges. Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes. During 2008, we recorded a net $6 million adjustment as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations in the federal jurisdiction offset by the write off of foreign incentive income tax benefits related to previously divested businesses. Noncontrolling interests in net earnings of subsidiaries. We recognized noncontrolling interest in net earnings of subsidiaries of $65 million in 2009 and $92 million in 2008 at Sky Brazil. Noncontrolling interest in net earnings of subsidiaries in 2009 decreased due to lower net income at Sky Brazil. Earnings Per Share. Class A common stock earnings per share (DIRECTV Group common stock for the period January 1, 2008 through 47 Table of Contents DIRECTV November 19, 2009) and weighted shares outstanding were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2009 2008 (Shares in Millions) Basic earnings attributable to DIRECTV Class A common stockholders per common share $ 0.96 $ 1.37 Diluted earnings attributable to DIRECTV Class A common stockholders per common share 0.95 1.37 Weighted average number of Class A common shares outstanding Basic 982 1,110 Diluted 989 1,114 The decreases in basic and diluted earnings per share for Class A common stock were due to lower net income attributable to DIRECTV, which was primarily due to the charge recorded for the Liberty Transaction in 2009, partially offset by the reduction in weighted shares outstanding resulting from our share repurchase program and the effect of the Liberty Transaction. DIRECTV U.S. Segment The following table provides operating results and a summary of key subscriber data for the DIRECTV U.S. segment: Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Subscriber Amounts) Revenues $ 18,671 $ 17,310 $ 1,361 7.9 % Operating costs and expenses Costs of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense Broadcast programming and other 8,027 7,424 603 8.1 % Subscriber service expenses 1,268 1,139 129 11.3 % Broadcast operations expenses 274 265 9 3.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense Subscriber acquisition costs 2,478 2,191 287 13.1 % Upgrade and retention costs 1,045 1,027 18 1.8 % General and administrative expenses 894 873 21 2.4 % Depreciation and amortization expense 2,275 2,061 214 10.4 % Total operating costs and expenses 16,261 14,980 1,281 8.6 % Operating profit $ 2,410 $ 2,330 $ 80 3.4 % Other data: Operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 4,685 $ 4,391 $ 294 6.7 % Total number of subscribers (000s) (1) 18,560 17,621 939 5.3 % ARPU $ 85.48 $ 83.90 $ 1.58 1.9 % Average monthly subscriber churn % 1.53 % 1.47 % 4.1 % Gross subscriber additions (000s) 4,273 3,904 369 9.5 % Subscriber disconnections (000s) 3,334 3,043 291 9.6 % Net subscriber additions (000s) 939 861 78 9.1 % Average subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber (SAC) $ 712 $ 715 $ (3 ) (0.4 )% (1)As discussed above in "Key Terminology," during 2008, we had a one time downward adjustment to our subscriber count of approximately 71,000 subscribers related to commercial equivalent viewing units. This adjustment did 48 Table of Contents DIRECTV not affect our revenue, operating profit, cash flows, net subscriber additions or average monthly subscriber churn. Subscribers. In 2009, gross subscriber additions increased primarily due to more aggressive promotions, marketing of the AT&T/DIRECTV bundle which began in February 2009, higher demand for advanced services and the impact of the transition to digital programming by broadcasters in the first half of 2009. Net subscriber additions increased from 2008 primarily due to the increase in gross additions, partially offset by higher subscriber disconnections due to a higher average monthly churn rate on a larger subscriber base. Average monthly subscriber churn increased primarily due to stricter upgrade and retention policies for existing customers as well as more aggressive competitor promotions combined with a weaker economy. Revenues. DIRECTV U.S. revenues increased as a result of the larger subscriber base and higher ARPU. The increase in ARPU resulted primarily from price increases on programming packages, higher HD and DVR product penetration, partially offset by more competitive customer promotions, the elimination of satellite lease revenue and lower premium movie package buy rates. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization. The improvement of operating profit before depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the gross profit generated from the higher revenues, partially offset by higher subscriber acquisition costs principally related to the increase in gross subscriber additions. Broadcast programming and other costs increased due to the larger number of subscribers in 2009 and annual program supplier rate increases. Subscriber service expenses increased primarily due to a larger subscriber base in 2009 and costs associated with service quality improvement initiatives. Subscriber acquisition costs increased primarily due to an increase in gross subscriber additions compared to 2008 and increased marketing and advertising costs. SAC per subscriber, which includes the cost of capitalized set top receivers, decreased primarily due to lower set top receiver costs and greater savings related to the increased usage of refurbished set top receivers through our lease program. Upgrade and retention costs increased in 2009 primarily due to the larger subscriber base, partially offset by decreased installation costs and decreased spending on other programs due to stricter spending policies. General and administrative expenses increased in 2009 primarily due to increased labor and benefit expense from the increase in headcount within our owned and operated home service provider installation business, partially offset by a $14 million charge in 2008 for the write off of accounts receivable for equipment and other costs incurred to effect the orderly transition of services from one of our home service providers that ceased operations. Operating profit. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense in 2009 resulting from the capitalization of set top receivers under the lease program. DIRECTV Latin America Segment The following table provides operating results and a summary of key subscriber data for the DIRECTV Latin America segment: Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Subscriber Amounts) Revenues $ 2,878 $ 2,383 $ 495 20.8 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization 697 690 7 1.0 % Operating profit 331 426 (95 ) (22.3 )% Other data: ARPU $ 57.12 $ 55.07 $ 2.05 3.7 % Average monthly subscriber churn % (1) 1.75 % 1.78 % (1.7 )% Total number of subscribers (000s) (2) 4,588 3,883 705 18.2 % Gross subscriber additions (000s) 1,575 1,393 182 13.1 % Net subscriber additions (000s) 692 623 69 11.1 % (1)In the year ended December 31, 2008, DIRECTV Latin America had a subscriber adjustment totaling 78,000 subscribers in Sky Brazil as a result of the inconsistent application of churn policies in previous 49 Table of Contents DIRECTV periods and the completion of the Sky Brazil and DIRECTV Brazil business integration. (2)DIRECTV Latin America subscriber data excludes subscribers of the Sky Mexico platform. We migrated approximately 3,000 subscribers from DIRECTV Latin America to Sky Mexico during 2009 and migrated approximately 19,000 subscribers from DIRECTV Latin America to Sky Mexico during 2008. Additionally, we migrated approximately 16,000 subscribers from a local pay television service provider in Latin America to Sky Brazil during 2009. Net subscriber additions as well as churn exclude the effect of these migrations. The increase in net subscriber additions was due to strong subscriber demand across the region, particularly in Colombia, Brazil and Puerto Rico, increased demand for DVR, HD and pre paid services, as well as targeted customer promotions. The decrease in average monthly subscriber churn was primarily due to two downward subscriber adjustments in 2008 totaling 78,000 subscribers. Excluding these subscriber adjustments, churn would have increased 17 basis points principally due to the growth of DTVLAs prepaid business. Revenues increased in 2009 primarily due to strong subscriber and ARPU growth. ARPU increased mainly due to price increases in Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina, as well as higher fees for HD and DVR services, partially offset by foreign currency devaluations, particularly in Brazil and Argentina. The higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization is primarily due to the gross profit generated from the higher revenues, partially offset by higher general and administrative expense due primarily to $213 million in currency related transaction fees in Venezuela, an increase in subscriber acquisition costs mostly due to an increase in gross subscriber additions and higher subscriber service costs primarily related to customer service improvement initiatives and the larger subscriber base. The lower operating profit was primarily due to the increase in operating profit before depreciation and amortization, offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to an increase in basic and advance product receivers leased over the last year. Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other Operating loss from Sports Networks, Elimination and Other increased to $68 million in 2009 from $61 million in 2008. Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other primarily consisted of corporate operating costs until November 19, 2009 when we completed the Liberty Transaction and acquired the RSNs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents and the cash flow that we generate from our operations. Additionally, from 2008 to 2010 we completed multiple financing transactions that have resulted in approximately $10.5 billion of net cash proceeds. We have also experienced significant growth in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow. We expect that net cash provided by operating activities will continue to grow and believe that our existing cash balances and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund our existing business plan. Additionally, in February 2011, DIRECTV U.S. entered into a new $2 billion revolving credit facility, which is available until 2016. We may borrow under this facility to fund share repurchases or to fund strategic investment opportunities should they arise. At December 31, 2010, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.5 billion compared with $2.6 billion at December 31, 2009. As a measure of liquidity, the current ratio (ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 0.96 at December 31, 2010 and 0.89 at December 31, 2009. Working capital improved by $449 million to a $197 million deficit at December 31, 2010 from a deficit of $646 million at December 31, 2009. The improvement during the period was mostly due to the decrease in our current debt balance due to the repayment of debt and the related equity collars as part of the Liberty Transaction. 50 Table of Contents DIRECTV Summary Cash Flow Information Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in Millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,206 $ 4,431 $ 3,910 Net cash used in investing activities (3,099 ) (2,194 ) (2,388 ) Net cash used in financing activities (3,210 ) (1,637 ) (600 ) Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,206 $ 4,431 $ 3,910 Less: Cash paid for property, equipment and satellites (2,416 ) (2,071 ) (2,229 ) Free cash flow $ 2,790 $ 2,360 $ 1,681 Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities The increases in net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to our higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization, which resulted from the higher gross profit generated from an increase in revenues. Cash paid for income taxes was $705 million in 2010, $484 million in 2009 and $706 million in 2008. The increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2010 resulted mainly from increased income from continuing operations and prior year tax credits taken in 2009. Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities During 2008 and 2009, we experienced a reduction in set top receiver costs and benefited from the use of refurbished set top receivers from the DIRECTV U.S. lease program, which resulted in a reduction in capital expenditures for property and equipment in 2008 and 2009. From 2009 to 2010, capital expenditures for set top receivers at DIRECTV U.S. remained relatively consistent. During 2008, 2009 and 2010, DIRECTV U.S. was in the process of constructing three satellites. Two of those satellites have been completed and placed into service. We expect to place the third satellite in service in the second half of 2013. Capital expenditures in Latin America for set top receivers provided to subscribers increased during 2008, 2009 and 2010. Part of our business strategy in Latin America is to increase advanced product and multi box installations; therefore, our capital expenditures in Latin America are expected to continue to increase. Additionally, in 2010, we paid $617 million for investments in companies, net of cash acquired, primarily for the purchase of Globos approximate 19% interest in Sky Brazil. We paid $37 million in 2009 and $204 million in 2008 for investments, net of cash acquired, in various other companies and $97 million, net of cash acquired, as part of the Liberty Transaction in 2009. These transactions are described in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Our cash spending on investment in companies is discretionary and we may fund strategic investment opportunities should they arise in the future. Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities Under stock repurchase plans approved by our Board of Directors, we completed the repurchase of our Class A common stock as follows: $5,111 million in 2010, $1,696 million during 2009 and $3,174 million during 2008. In the first quarter of 2011, we announced a new repurchase program authorization of $6 billion. We may make purchases under this program in the open market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing, nature and amount of such transactions will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and the program may be suspended, discontinued or accelerated at any time. The sources of funds for the purchases under the remaining authorization are our existing cash on hand, cash from operations and potential additional borrowings. During 2010, we had $5,978 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. We also repaid $2,323 million of our long term debt, and paid approximately $1,537 million to settle the debt and related equity collars assumed as part of the Liberty Transaction. During 2009, we had $1,990 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. We also repaid $1,018 million of our long term debt, and paid approximately $751 million to settle a portion of the debt and related equity collars assumed as part of the Liberty Transaction. In 2008, we had 51 Table of Contents DIRECTV $2,490 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and borrowings under DIRECTV U.S. senior secured credit facility. We also repaid $53 million of our long term debt during 2008. We anticipate additional borrowings in the future in order to achieve our target of outstanding long term debt of 2.5 times DIRECTV U.S. operating profit before depreciation and amortization. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to an increase in net cash provided by operating activities described above, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures. The increase in capital expenditures resulted primarily from an increase in subscriber leased equipment, satellite and other infrastructure at DTVLA. Debt At December 31, 2010, we had $10,510 million in total outstanding borrowings, bearing a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%. Our outstanding borrowings primarily consist of notes payable issued by DIRECTV U.S. as more fully described in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Part II of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. Our notes payable and short term borrowings mature as follows: $38 million in 2011, $1,000 million in 2014, $2,200 million in 2015 and $7,300 million thereafter. Revolving Credit Facility In February 2011, DIRECTV U.S. senior secured credit facility was terminated and replaced by a new 5 year, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. We pay a commitment fee of .30% per year for the unused commitment under the revolving credit facility, and borrowings will bear interest at an annual rate of (i) the London interbank offer rate (LIBOR) (or for Euro advances the EURIBOR rate) plus 1.50% or at our option (ii) the higher of the prime rate plus 0.50% or the Fed Funds Rate plus 1.00%. The commitment fee and the annual interest rate may be increased or decreased under certain conditions, which include changes in DIRECTV U.S. long term, unsecured debt ratings. The revolving credit facility is unsecured and has been fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by substantially all of DIRECTV U.S. current and certain of its future domestic subsidiaries on a senior unsecured basis. Covenants and Restrictions. The revolving credit facility requires DIRECTV U.S. to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a specified ratio of indebtedness to adjusted net income. The revolving credit facility also includes covenants that restrict DIRECTV U.S. ability to, among other things, (i) incur additional subsidiary indebtedness, (ii) incur liens, (iii) enter into certain transactions with affiliates, (iv) merge or consolidate with another entity, (v) sell, assign, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, and (vi) change its lines of business. Additionally, the senior notes contain restrictive covenants that are similar. Should DIRECTV U.S. fail to comply with these covenants, all or a portion of its borrowings under the senior notes could become immediately payable and its revolving credit facility could be terminated. As of February 7, 2011, the closing date of the revolving credit facility, DIRECTV U.S. was in compliance with all such covenants. The senior notes and revolving credit facility also provide that the borrowings may be required to be prepaid if certain change in control events occur. Contingencies National Football League Strike or Lockout. DIRECTV U.S. has a contract with the National Football League for the exclusive rights to distribute the NFL Sunday Ticket Package to DIRECTV U.S. subscribers. The NFLs collective bargaining agreement with its players expires before the beginning of the 2011 2012 NFL season. If there is a players strike or an owners lockout and no games are played or a reduced schedule is played, DIRECTV U.S. would still be obligated to make certain contractual payments to the NFL for such season. DIRECTV U.S. subscriber revenues would decrease if NFL games are not played or a full season is lost and cash flows from operating activities would decrease from lower revenues as well as our continuing obligation to make certain contractual payments to the NFL. DIRECTV U.S. will be able to partially offset these payments through provisions such as credits in the following year, reimbursements for games not played and its rights to an extra season if the entire season is cancelled, but in the near term a strike or lockout could have a material 52 Table of Contents DIRECTV adverse effect on our cash flows from operating activities primarily due to payments we may have to make to the NFL, including minimum contractual obligations, an optional advance payment that may be requested by the NFL and the loss of subscriber revenue, as well as possibly resulting in reduced subscriber additions and higher churn. Venezuela devaluation and exchange controls. In January 2010, the Venezuelan government announced the creation of a dual exchange rate system, including an exchange rate of 4.3 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar for most of the activities of our Venezuelan operations compared to an exchange rate of 2.15 Venezuelan bolivars fuerte prior to the announcement. As a result of this devaluation, we recorded a $6 million charge to net income in the year ended December 31, 2010 related to the adjustment of net bolivars fuerte denominated monetary assets to the new official exchange rate. We began reporting the operating results of our Venezuelan subsidiary in the first quarter of 2010 using the devalued rate of 4.3 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar. In December 2010, the Venezuelan government announced the elimination of the dual exchange rate system, eliminating the 2.6 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar preferential rate which was available for certain activities. Companies operating in Venezuela are required to obtain Venezuelan government approval to exchange Venezuelan bolivars fuerte into U.S. dollars at the official rate. We have not been able to consistently exchange Venezuelan bolivars fuerte into U.S. dollars at the official rate and as a result, we have relied on a parallel exchange process to settle U.S. dollar obligations and to repatriate accumulated cash balances prior to its close. The rates implied by transactions in the parallel market, which was closed in May 2010, were significantly higher than the official rate (6 to 7 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar). As a result, we recorded a $22 million charge in 2010, a $213 million charge in 2009 and a $29 million charge in 2008 in "General and administrative expenses" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in connection with the exchange of accumulated Venezuelan cash balances to U.S. dollars using the parallel exchange process. As a result of the closing of the parallel exchange process in May 2010, we have been unable to repatriate excess cash balances and as a result, we have realized lower charges for the repatriation of cash in 2010 and our Venezuelan subsidiary had accumulated Venezuelan bolivars fuerte denominated cash of $169 million at December 31, 2010, as compared to $33 million at December 31, 2009 using the official exchange rate. In June 2010, the Venezuelan government established the SITME, an alternative to the official process for exchanging foreign currency. Venezuelan entities can purchase U.S. dollar denominated securities through the SITME; however, trading volume is limited to $50,000 per day with a maximum equivalent of $350,000 in a calendar month, subject to certain limitations. The SITME has established a weighted average implicit exchange rate of approximately 5.3 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar. As a result of these recent developments, our ability to pay U.S. dollar denominated obligations and repatriate cash generated in Venezuela in excess of local operating requirements is limited, resulting in an increase in the cash balance at our Venezuelan subsidiary. We expect to continue our practice of repatriating cash generated in Venezuela in excess of local operating requirements. At such time that exchange controls are eased, accumulated cash balances may ultimately be repatriated at less than their currently reported value, as the official exchange rate has not changed despite continuing high inflation in Venezuela. These conditions are also expected to affect growth in our Venezuelan business which is dependent on our ability to purchase set top boxes and other components using U.S. dollars. Using the official 4.3 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2010, our Venezuelan subsidiary had net Venezuelan bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets of $85 million in excess of Venezuelan bolivar fuerte denominated monetary liabilities, including cash of $169 million as of December 31, 2010. Income taxes. During 2010, we entered into an agreement with a former owner to settle certain tax contingencies. As a result of this settlement we recorded a benefit of $39 million in "Income tax expense" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2010. Globo. As discussed in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, Globo has the right to exchange its remaining Sky Brazil shares for cash or our common shares. If Globo exercises this right, we have the option to elect to 53 Table of Contents DIRECTV pay the consideration in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of both. Other. Several factors may affect our ability to fund our operations and commitments that we discuss in "Contractual Obligations", "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements" and "Contingencies" below. In addition, our future cash flows may be reduced if we experience, among other things, significantly higher subscriber additions than planned, increased subscriber churn or upgrade and retention costs, higher than planned capital expenditures for satellites and broadcast equipment, or satellite anomalies or signal theft. Additionally, DIRECTV U.S. ability to borrow under its revolving credit facility is contingent upon DIRECTV U.S. meeting a financial and other covenants associated with its facility as more fully described above. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010, including the future periods in which payments are expected. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 referenced in the table. Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Dollars in Millions) Long term debt obligations (Note 9) (a) $ 16,788 $ 613 $ 1,154 $ 2,053 $ 12,968 Purchase obligations (Note 19) (b) 9,001 2,029 3,780 2,182 1,010 Operating lease obligations (Note 19) (c) 434 77 123 82 152 Capital lease obligations (Note 11) 877 95 183 164 435 Other long term liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under GAAP (Note 19) (d) 136 136 Total $ 27,236 $ 2,950 $ 5,240 $ 4,481 $ 14,565 (a)Long term debt obligations include interest calculated based on the rates in effect at December 31, 2010, however, the obligations do not reflect potential prepayments required under its indentures. (b)Purchase obligations consist primarily of broadcast programming commitments, regional professional team rights agreements, service contract commitments and satellite launch contracts. Broadcast programming commitments include guaranteed minimum contractual commitments that are typically based on a flat fee or a minimum number of required subscribers subscribing to the related programming. Actual payments may exceed the minimum payment requirements if the actual number of subscribers subscribing to the related programming exceeds the minimum amounts. Service contract commitments include minimum commitments for the purchase of services that have been outsourced to third parties, such as billing services, telemetry, tracking and control services and broadcast center services. In most cases, actual payments, which are typically based on volume, usually exceed these minimum amounts. 54 Table of Contents DIRECTV (c)Certain of the operating leases contain escalation clauses and renewal or purchase options, which we do not consider in the amounts disclosed. (d)Payments due by period for other long term liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under GAAP do not include payments that could be made related to our net unrecognized tax benefits liability, which amounted to $362 million as of December 31, 2010. The timing and amount of any future payments is not reasonably estimable, as such payments are dependent on the completion and resolution of examinations with tax authorities. We do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations within the next twelve months. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2010, we were contingently liable under standby letters of credit and bonds in the aggregate amount of $85 million primarily related to insurance deductibles. CONTINGENCIES For a discussion of "Contingencies", see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS For a discussion of "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions," see Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported for future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represents what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Income Taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining provisions for income taxes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, tax benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets at each reporting date and where applicable, record a valuation allowance to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized in the future. Our assessment includes an analysis of whether deferred tax assets will be realized in the ordinary course of operations based on the available positive and negative evidence, including the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and forecasted income from operating activities. The underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment. In the event that actual income from operating activities differs from forecasted amounts, or if we change our estimates of forecasted income from operating activities, we could record additional charges or reduce allowances in order to adjust the carrying value of deferred tax assets to their realizable amount. Such adjustments could be material to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, the recognition of a tax benefit for tax positions involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We provide for taxes for uncertain tax positions where assessments have not been received. We believe such tax reserves are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, we adjust these amounts only when more information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. Future events such as changes in the facts or law, judicial decisions regarding the application of existing law or a favorable audit outcome will result in changes to the amounts provided. 55 Table of Contents DIRECTV Contingent Matters. Determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingent matter, including but not limited to legal and tax issues, and the amount of such accrual, if any, requires a significant amount of management judgment and estimation. We develop our judgments and estimates in consultation with outside counsel based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter, we could record a charge in a future period that would be material to our consolidated financial statements. Depreciable Lives of Leased Set Top Receivers. We currently lease most set top receivers provided to new and existing subscribers and therefore capitalize the cost of those set top receivers. We depreciate capitalized set top receivers at DIRECTV U.S. over a three year estimated useful life, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Changes in the estimated useful lives of set top receivers capitalized could result in significant changes to the amounts recorded as depreciation expense. We regularly evaluate the estimated useful life of our set top receivers and it is possible that we may change the useful life of set top receivers at DIRECTV U.S. in the near term. If we had changed the depreciable life of DIRECTV U.S. set top receivers as of January 1, 2010 to four years, annual depreciation for 2010 would have decreased by over $300 million. Valuation of Long Lived Assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We consider the carrying value of a long lived asset impaired when the anticipated undiscounted future cash flow from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset. We determine fair value primarily using the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved, and other valuation techniques. We determine losses on long lived assets to be disposed of in a similar manner, except that we reduce the fair value for the cost of disposal. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances change that would more likely than not result in an impairment loss. We completed our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2010, and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives. As of December 31, 2010, the fair value of each reporting unit and our intangible assets with indefinite lives significantly exceed their carrying values. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. The goodwill evaluation requires the estimation of the fair value of reporting units where we record goodwill. We determine fair values primarily using estimated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved, when appropriate. Estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgment about future operating results, and can vary significantly from one evaluation to the next. Risk adjusted discount rates are not fixed and are subject to change over time. As a result, changes in estimated future cash flows and or changes in discount rates could result in a write down of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For a discussion of accounting changes and new accounting pronouncements see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. *** 56 Table of Contents DIRECTV  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses referred to below include forward looking statements of market risk which assume for analytical purposes that certain adverse market conditions may occur. Actual future market conditions may differ materially from such assumptions and the amounts noted below are the result of analyses used for the purpose of assessing possible risks and the mitigation thereof. Accordingly, you should not consider the forward looking statements as our projections of future events or losses. General Our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and changes in the market value of our equity investments. We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet our risk management objectives, and do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Risk We generally conduct our business in U.S. dollars with some business conducted in a variety of foreign currencies and therefore we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Accordingly, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, commitments and anticipated foreign currency transactions. The gains and losses on derivative foreign exchange contracts offset changes in value of the related exposures. As of December 31, 2010, we had no significant foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding. The impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in exchange rates on our net assets would be a loss of $121 million, net of taxes, at December 31, 2010, a significant portion of which would be recorded in "Foreign currency translation activity during the period" in our Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity. Interest Rate Risk From time to time, we may be subject to fluctuating interest rates for variable rate borrowings, which may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. We had outstanding debt of $10,510 million at December 31, 2010, which mostly consisted of DIRECTV U.S. fixed rate borrowings. *** 57  Table of Contents DIRECTV
