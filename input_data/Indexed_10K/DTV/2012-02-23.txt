ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSE OF THE "SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This Annual Report on Form 10 K may contain certain statements that we believe are, or may be considered to be, "forward looking statements" within the meaning of various provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward looking statements generally can be identified by use of statements that include phrases such as we "believe," "expect," "estimate," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "project" or other similar references to future periods. Examples of forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make related to our business strategy and regarding our outlook for 2012 financial results, liquidity and capital resources. Forward looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include economic, business, competitive, national or global political, market and regulatory conditions and other risks, each of which is described in more detail in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report. Any forward looking statement made by us in this Annual Report on Form 10 K speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may occur and it is not possible for us to predict them all. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. CONTENTS The following is a discussion of our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in Millions) Other Data: Operating profit before depreciation and amortization (1) Operating profit $ 4,629 $ 3,896 $ 2,673 Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 2,349 2,482 2,640 Operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 6,978 $ 6,378 $ 5,313 Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin 25.6 % 26.5 % 24.6 % Cash flow information Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,185 $ 5,206 $ 4,431 Net cash used in investing activities (3,022 ) (3,099 ) (2,194 ) Net cash used in financing activities (2,792 ) (3,210 ) (1,637 ) Free cash flow (2) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,185 $ 5,206 $ 4,431 Less: Cash paid for property and equipment (2,924 ) (2,303 ) (2,012 ) Less: Cash paid for satellites (246 ) (113 ) (59 ) Free cash flow $ 2,015 $ 2,790 $ 2,360 (1)Operating profit before depreciation and amortization, which is a financial measure that is not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, can be calculated by adding amounts under the caption "Depreciation and amortization expense" to "Operating profit." This measure should be used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures and is not presented as an alternative measure of operating results, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our management and our Board of Directors use operating profit before depreciation and amortization to evaluate the operating performance of our company and our business segments and to allocate resources and capital to business segments. This metric is also used as a measure of performance for incentive compensation purposes and to measure income generated from operations that could be used to fund capital expenditures, service debt or pay taxes. Depreciation and amortization expense primarily represents an allocation to current expense of the cost of historical capital expenditures and for acquired intangible assets resulting from prior business acquisitions. To compensate for the exclusion of depreciation and amortization expense from operating profit, our management and our Board of Directors separately measure and budget for capital expenditures and business acquisitions. 33 Table of Contents DIRECTV  SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION (continued) We believe this measure is useful to investors, along with GAAP measures (such as revenues, operating profit and net income), to compare our operating performance to other communications, entertainment and media service providers. We believe that investors use current and projected operating profit before depreciation and amortization and similar measures to estimate our current or prospective enterprise value and make investment decisions. This metric provides investors with a means to compare operating results exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. Our management believes this is useful given the significant variation in depreciation and amortization expense that can result from the timing of capital expenditures, the capitalization of intangible assets, potential variations in expected useful lives when compared to other companies and periodic changes to estimated useful lives. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin is calculated by dividing Operating profit before depreciation and amortization by Revenues. (2)Free cash flow, which is a financial measure that is not determined in accordance with GAAP, can be calculated by deducting amounts under the captions "Cash paid for property and equipment" and "Cash paid for satellites" from "Net cash provided by operating activities" from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This financial measure should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures and is not presented as an alternative measure of cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our management and our Board of Directors use free cash flow to evaluate the cash generated by our current subscriber base, net of capital expenditures, for the purpose of allocating resources to activities such as adding new subscribers, retaining and upgrading existing subscribers, for additional capital expenditures and other capital investments or transactions and as a measure of performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe this measure is useful to investors, along with other GAAP measures (such as cash flows from operating and investing activities), to compare our operating performance to other communications, entertainment and media companies. We believe that investors also use current and projected free cash flow to determine the ability of revenues from our current and projected subscriber base to fund required and discretionary spending and to help determine our financial value. 34 Table of Contents DIRECTV  SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION (concluded)  Selected Segment Data Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. Revenues $ 21,872 $ 20,268 $ 18,671 % of total revenues 80.3 % 84.1 % 86.6 % Operating profit $ 3,702 $ 3,290 $ 2,410 Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 1,587 1,926 2,275 Operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 5,289 $ 5,216 $ 4,685 Operating profit margin 16.9 % 16.2 % 12.9 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin 24.2 % 25.7 % 25.1 % Segment assets $ 11,796 $ 11,400 $ 12,408 Capital expenditures 1,736 1,557 1,485 DIRECTV Latin America Revenues $ 5,096 $ 3,597 $ 2,878 % of total revenues 18.7 % 14.9 % 13.3 % Operating profit $ 916 $ 623 $ 331 Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 747 541 366 Operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 1,663 $ 1,164 $ 697 Operating profit margin 18.0 % 17.3 % 11.5 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin 32.6 % 32.4 % 24.2 % Segment assets $ 5,264 $ 4,696 $ 3,772 Capital expenditures 1,428 857 584 Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other Revenues $ 258 $ 237 $ 16 % of total revenues 0.9 % 1.0 % 0.1 % Operating profit (loss) $ 11 $ (17 ) $ (68 ) Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 15 15 (1 ) Operating profit (loss) before depreciation and amortization $ 26 $ (2 ) $ (69 ) Segment assets $ 1,363 $ 1,813 $ 2,080 Capital expenditures 6 2 2 Total Revenues $ 27,226 $ 24,102 $ 21,565 Operating profit $ 4,629 $ 3,896 $ 2,673 Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 2,349 2,482 2,640 Operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 6,978 $ 6,378 $ 5,313 Operating profit margin 17.0 % 16.2 % 12.4 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin 25.6 % 26.5 % 24.6 % Total assets $ 18,423 $ 17,909 $ 18,260 Capital expenditures 3,170 2,416 2,071 35  Table of Contents DIRECTV SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFFECTING THE COMPARABILITY OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Change in Accounting Estimate Depreciable Lives of Leased Set Top Receivers We currently lease most set top receivers provided to new and existing subscribers and therefore capitalize the cost of those set top receivers. We depreciate capitalized set top receivers over the estimated useful life of the equipment. As a result of the completion of an extensive evaluation of the estimated useful life of the set top receivers, including consideration of historical write offs, improved efficiencies in our refurbishment program, improved set top receiver failure rates over time and managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence, we determined that the estimated useful life of HD set top receivers used in our DIRECTV U.S. business has increased to four years, from three years, as previously estimated. We will continue to depreciate standard definition set top receivers at DIRECTV U.S. over a three year estimated useful life. We are accounting for this change in the useful life of the HD set top receivers at DIRECTV U.S. as a change in an accounting estimate beginning July 1, 2011. This change had the effect of reducing depreciation and amortization expense and increasing both net income attributable to DIRECTV and earnings per share in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 as follows: (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Depreciation and amortization expense $ (141 ) Net income attributable to DIRECTV 86 Basic earnings attributable to DIRECTV Class A stockholders per common share $ 0.12 Diluted earnings attributable to DIRECTV Class A stockholders per common share $ 0.11 Divestitures In April 2011, we sold an equity method investment for $55 million in cash. We recognized a $37 million gain ($23 million after tax) on the sale in "Other, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In March 2011, we sold a 5% ownership interest in GSN for $60 million in cash, reducing our ownership interest to 60%. We recognized a $25 million gain, or $16 million after tax, on the sale in "Other, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which represents the difference between the selling price and the carrying amount of the portion of our equity method investment sold. For additional information regarding the GSN sale, refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Part II of this Annual Report. Malone Transaction In April 2010, we entered into an agreement with Dr. John C. Malone and his family, or the Malones, under which they exchanged 21.8 million shares of high vote DIRECTV Class B common stock, which were all of the outstanding DIRECTV Class B shares, for 26.5 million shares of DIRECTV Class A common stock, resulting in the reduction of the Malones voting interest in DIRECTV from approximately 24% to approximately 3% on June 16, 2010. We accounted for the exchange of DIRECTV Class B common stock into DIRECTV Class A common stock pursuant to accounting standards for induced conversions, whereby the $160 million in incremental DIRECTV Class A common stock issued to the former DIRECTV Class B stockholders has been deducted from earnings attributable to DIRECTV Class A stockholders for purposes of calculating earnings per share in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result of this transaction, diluted earnings per DIRECTV Class A common stock in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was reduced by $0.18 for the year ended December 31, 2010. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Part II of this Annual Report for additional information. Acquisitions Globo Transaction. In connection with our acquisition of Sky Brazil in 2006, Globo was granted the right, until January 2014, to require us to purchase all or a portion (but not less than half) of its 25.9% interest in Sky Brazil. In June 2010, Globo notified us that it was exercising its right to exchange 178.8 million shares representing approximately 19% of the ownership interests in Sky Brazil. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we paid cash for the approximate 19% ownership interest, which was recorded as a reduction to "Redeemable noncontrolling interest" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We and our subsidiaries now own approximately 93% of Sky Brazil and Globo retains the right to sell its remaining 36 Table of Contents DIRECTV 7% interest to us at fair value until January 2014 as discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Part II of this Annual Report. Liberty Transaction. On November 19, 2009, The DIRECTV Group, Inc., or DIRECTV Group, and Liberty Media Corporation, which we refer to as Liberty or Liberty Media, obtained stockholder approval of and closed a series of related transactions which we refer to collectively as the Liberty Transaction. As a result of the Liberty Transaction, DIRECTV Group and LEI became wholly owned subsidiaries of DIRECTV. LEI consisted of the following: Libertys 57% interest in DIRECTV Group, a 100% interest in three regional sports networks, a 65% interest in Game Show Network, LLC, approximately $120 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $2.1 billion of indebtedness comprised of a credit facility with a principal balance of $1,878 million, which we refer to as the Collar Loan, and a series of related equity collars. The assets, liabilities and results of operations of LEI have been consolidated beginning on the acquisition date, November 19, 2009. As a result of the Liberty Transaction we paid $97 million of cash which is net of cash acquired at LEI and the regional sports networks. We also recorded a $491 million charge to "Liberty transaction and related gains (charges)" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 related to a premium paid to LEI stockholders to complete the merger in the form of an equity interest that exceeded the fair value of net assets acquired by DIRECTV; general and administrative costs incurred to complete the transaction and net losses recorded for the partial settlement of the equity collars and stock options and stock appreciation rights held by Liberty employees subsequent to the acquisition date, and adjustments of the equity collars and stock options and stock appreciation rights. We recorded a $67 million net gain in "Liberty transaction and related gains (charges)" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the final settlement of the equity collars during 2010. During 2010, we repaid $1,537 million, including $1,202 million of remaining principal payments and $335 million to settle the equity collars. During 2009, we repaid a total of $751 million, including $676 million in principal payments and $75 million in payments to settle a portion of the equity collars. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. Financing Transactions In 2011, DIRECTV U.S. issued $4.0 billion of senior notes resulting in $3,990 million of proceeds, net of discount. Also in 2011, DIRECTV U.S. purchased and redeemed its then outstanding $1,002 million of 6.375% senior notes, resulting in a pre tax charge of $25 million, $16 million after tax, primarily for the premiums paid. The charge was recorded in "Other, net" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In 2010, DIRECTV U.S. issued $6.0 billion of senior notes resulting in $5,978 million of proceeds, net of discount, and repaid the $2,205 million of remaining principal on the Term Loans of its senior secured credit facility. The repayment of the Term Loans resulted in a 2010 pre tax charge recorded in "Other, net" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations of $16 million, $10 million after tax, resulting from the write off of deferred debt issuance and other transaction costs. In 2009, DIRECTV U.S. issued $2.0 billion of senior notes resulting in $1,990 million of proceeds, net of discount. Also in 2009, DIRECTV U.S. purchased and redeemed its then outstanding $910 million 8.375% senior notes, resulting in a 2009 pre tax charge of $34 million, $21 million after tax, of which $29 million resulted from a premium paid for the redemption and $5 million resulted from the write off of deferred debt issuance costs and other transaction costs. The charge was recorded in "Other, net" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Venezuela Exchange Controls In January 2010, the Venezuelan government announced the creation of a dual exchange rate system, including an exchange rate of 4.3 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar for most of the activities of our Venezuelan operations compared to an exchange rate of 2.15 Venezuelan bolivars fuerte prior to the announcement. As a result of this devaluation, we recorded a $6 million charge to net income in the year ended December 31, 2010 related to the adjustment of net bolivars fuerte denominated monetary assets to the new official exchange rate. We began reporting the operating results of our Venezuelan subsidiary in the first quarter of 2010 using the devalued rate of 4.3 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar. In December 2010, the Venezuelan government announced the elimination of the dual exchange rate system, eliminating the 2.6 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar preferential rate which was available for certain activities. 37 Table of Contents DIRECTV Companies operating in Venezuela are required to obtain Venezuelan government approval to exchange bolivars fuerte into U.S. dollars at the official rate. We have not been able to consistently exchange Venezuelan bolivars fuerte into U.S. dollars at the official rate and as a result, we have relied on a parallel exchange process to settle U.S. dollar obligations and to repatriate accumulated cash balances prior to its close. The rates implied by transactions in the parallel market, which was closed in May, 2010, were significantly higher than the official rate (6 to 7 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar). As a result, we recorded a $22 million charge in 2010 and a $213 million charge in 2009 in "General and administrative expenses" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in connection with the exchange of accumulated Venezuelan cash balances to U.S. dollars using the parallel exchange process. As a result of the closing of the parallel exchange process in May 2010, we have been unable to repatriate excess cash balances and we therefore realized no charges for the repatriation of cash in 2011. Our Venezuelan subsidiary had Venezuelan bolivar fuerte denominated cash of $401 million at December 31, 2011, as compared to $169 million at December 31, 2010, based on the official exchange rate. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for additional information. Other Than Temporary Impairment In 2009, we recognized a $45 million charge for the other than temporary impairment of certain of our investments in "Other, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Share Repurchase Program Since 2006 our Board of Directors approved multiple authorizations for the repurchase of our common stock. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $866 million remaining under the authorization given by the Board of Directors in 2011. In February 2012 our Board of Directors authorized up to an additional $6 billion for repurchases of our common stock. The following table sets forth information regarding shares repurchased and retired for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Total cost of repurchased and retired shares $ 5,455 $ 5,179 $ 1,696 Average price per share 45.78 38.20 23.79 Number of shares repurchased and retired 119 136 71 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK The United States and other countries in which we operate are continuing to undergo a period of economic uncertainty. As discussed in "Competition" in Item 1, in addition to cable and satellite system operators, we are experiencing increasing competition from telcos and other emerging digital media distribution providers. Please refer to "Risk Factors" in Item 1A for a further discussion of risks which may affect forecasted results of our business generally. DIRECTV U.S. DIRECTV U.S. faces key challenges related to weak macroeconomic conditions that continue to put pressure on the U.S. consumer, the rapid advance of technology that provides consumers with more options both in and out of the home and a maturing industry that is increasingly competitive. In addition, we face challenges as programming content providers seek increased rates for their content. We are pursuing strategic priorities for the DIRECTV U.S. business that we believe will result in an increase in revenue and operating profit before depreciation and amortization growth over the next three years: focusing on enhancing the overall customer experience, strategically managing the impact of rising programming costs to maintain strong margins and continuing to grow three key incremental revenue streams: DIRECTV Cinema, commercial and local advertising. Our revenue growth in DIRECTV U.S. has been generated by increases in the total number of subscribers and in ARPU. In 2012, we expect revenue to grow in the mid single digit percentage range driven primarily by ARPU growth. ARPU growth is expected to be generated mainly by price increases, as well as growth in advanced product services, pay per view, commercial and advertising sales. We also expect to support ARPU growth by limiting promotional offers. 38 Table of Contents DIRECTV In 2012, we expect operating profit before depreciation and amortization to grow in the mid single digit percent range. We intend to manage the impact to our margins from higher programming costs by productivity improvements from recent capital projects and by closely managing other costs across the organization, including subscriber services, broadcast operations costs and general and administrative expenses. We also expect aggregate subscriber acquisition costs to be lower in 2012 as a result of lower anticipated gross subscriber additions in 2012 as compared to 2011. We expect capital expenditures in 2012 to be relatively flat with 2011 levels as the lower capital expenditures associated with anticipated lower gross additions is expected to be offset by increased capital expenditures for DIRECTV U.S. satellites, D14 and D15. DIRECTV Latin America. In Latin America, pay TV penetration and relatively favorable macroeconomic and demographic trends continue to provide a substantial opportunity for growth. In 2012, we intend to profitably increase market share in the region. In particular, we will continue to strengthen our leadership position in the higher end markets with a focus on our superior HD and DVR products. In addition, we plan to further penetrate the rapidly growing middle market by continuing to offer attractive lower priced post paid packages and pre paid services throughout the region. In 2012, we expect subscriber and revenue growth of approximately 20% and operating profit before amortization and depreciation percentage growth in the mid to upper teens. We also expect capital expenditures to increase approximately 10% driven by subscriber growth, investments in upgrading DIRECTV Latin Americas infrastructure, including satellites, as well as strategic initiatives. DIRECTV Consolidated. We expect diluted earnings per common share to grow well over $4 per share in 2012 resulting from higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization coupled with a continued decline in weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from our share repurchase program, partially offset by increased interest and income tax expenses. At the consolidated DIRECTV level, we anticipate free cash flow, or cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to be relatively flat compared to 2011 as the anticipated growth in operating profit before depreciation and amortization is expected to be offset by higher cash paid for taxes and interest. We believe that cash paid for taxes will be higher in 2012 as a result of an increase in earnings before taxes coupled with an increase in our cash tax rate in the 30% range as a result of the reversal of accelerated depreciation benefits associated with the prior year economic stimulus programs. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Consolidated Results of Operations We discuss changes for each of our segments in more detail below. Revenues. The following table presents our revenues by segment: Revenues by segment: Change 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 21,872 $ 20,268 $ 1,604 7.9 % DIRECTV Latin America 5,096 3,597 1,499 41.7 % Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other 258 237 21 8.9 % Total Revenues $ 27,226 $ 24,102 $ 3,124 13.0 % The increase in our total revenues was due to subscriber growth and higher ARPU at our DIRECTV Latin America and DIRECTV U.S businesses. 39 Table of Contents DIRECTV Operating profit before depreciation and amortization. The following table presents our operating profit (loss) before depreciation and amortization by segment: Operating profit (loss) before depreciation and amortization by segment: Change 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 5,289 $ 5,216 $ 73 1.4 % DIRECTV Latin America 1,663 1,164 499 42.9 % Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other 26 (2 ) 28 NM* Total operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 6,978 $ 6,378 $ 600 9.4 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin 25.6 % 26.5 % *Percentage not meaningful. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to growth at our DIRECTV Latin America business. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to higher programming costs at our DIRECTV U.S. business. Operating profit. The following table presents our operating profit (loss) by segment: Operating profit (loss) by segment: Change 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 3,702 $ 3,290 $ 412 12.5 % DIRECTV Latin America 916 623 293 47.0 % Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other 11 (17 ) 28 NM Total operating profit $ 4,629 $ 3,896 $ 733 18.8 % Operating profit margin 17.0 % 16.2 % Operating profit and the operating profit margin increased from 2011 as compared to 2010 as the lower operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin discussed above was more than offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense at DIRECTV U.S. due to the change in the estimated depreciable lives of HD set top receivers at DIRECTV U.S., declining subscriber equipment capitalization and the end of the amortization of a subscriber related intangible asset, partially offset by increased depreciation at DIRECTV Latin America due to increased capitalization of subscriber equipment. Interest income. Interest income was $34 million in 2011 and $39 million in 2010. Interest expense. The increase in interest expense to $763 million in 2011 from $557 million in 2010 was due to an increase in the average debt balances compared to 2010, partially offset by a decrease in weighted average interest rates. We capitalized interest costs of $13 million in 2011 and $6 million in 2010. Liberty transaction and related gains (charges). In 2010, we recorded a $67 million net gain from the settlement of the equity collars and debt assumed as part of the Liberty Transaction. Other, net. The significant components of "Other, net" were as follows: 2011 2010 Change (Dollars in Millions) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries $ 109 $ 90 $ 19 Net foreign currency transaction (loss) gain (50 ) 11 (61 ) Fair value adjustment loss on non employee stock options (4 ) (11 ) 7 Loss on early extinguishment of debt (25 ) (16 ) (9 ) Net gain from sale of investments 63 6 57 Other (9 ) (11 ) 2 Total $ 84 $ 69 $ 15 The increase in Other, net in 2011 as compared to 2010 is primarily due to gains recognized on the sale of equity method investments and higher earnings in unconsolidated subsidiaries, partially offset by a net foreign currency transaction loss for 2011 compared to a net foreign currency transaction gain in 2010, primarily due to the depreciation of the Brazilian real compared to the U.S. dollar. Income tax expense. We recognized income tax expense of $1,348 million in 2011 and $1,202 million in 2010. The effective tax rate for 2011 was 33.8% compared to 34.2% for 2010. The lower effective tax rate was primarily attributable 40 Table of Contents DIRECTV to a benefit recorded for previously unrecognized foreign tax credits and a benefit recorded for domestic production activities deduction in 2011. Noncontrolling interests in net earnings of subsidiaries. We recognized noncontrolling interests in net earnings of subsidiaries of $27 million in 2011 and $114 million in 2010 at Sky Brazil. Noncontrolling interests in net earnings of subsidiaries in 2011 decreased due to the Globo Transaction in the fourth quarter of 2010 which increased our ownership percentage in Sky Brazil and a net tax benefit attributable to the noncontrolling interest resulting from the release of a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance in 2010. Earnings Per Share. Class A common stock earnings per share and weighted shares outstanding were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 (Shares in Millions) Basic earnings attributable to DIRECTV Class A common stockholders per common share $ 3.49 $ 2.31 Diluted earnings attributable to DIRECTV Class A common stockholders per common share 3.47 2.30 Weighted average number of Class A common shares outstanding Basic 747 870 Diluted 752 876 The increases in basic and diluted earnings per share for Class A common stock were due to higher net income attributable to DIRECTV, a reduction in weighted average shares outstanding resulting from our share repurchase program, and the $0.19 reduction to basic and $0.18 reduction to diluted earnings per Class A common share resulting from the Malone Transaction in 2010. DIRECTV U.S. Segment The following table provides operating results and a summary of key subscriber data for the DIRECTV U.S. segment: Change 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Subscriber Amounts) Revenues $ 21,872 $ 20,268 $ 1,604 7.9 % Operating costs and expenses Costs of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense Broadcast programming and other 9,799 8,699 1,100 12.6 % Subscriber service expenses 1,435 1,340 95 7.1 % Broadcast operations expenses 300 273 27 9.9 % Selling, general and administrative expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense Subscriber acquisition costs 2,794 2,631 163 6.2 % Upgrade and retention costs 1,209 1,106 103 9.3 % General and administrative expenses 1,046 1,003 43 4.3 % Depreciation and amortization expense 1,587 1,926 (339 ) (17.6 )% Total operating costs and expenses 18,170 16,978 1,192 7.0 % Operating profit $ 3,702 $ 3,290 $ 412 12.5 % Operating profit margin 16.9 % 16.2 % Other data: Operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 5,289 $ 5,216 $ 73 1.4 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin 24.2 % 25.7 % Total number of subscribers (in thousands) 19,885 19,223 662 3.4 % ARPU $ 93.27 $ 89.71 $ 3.56 4.0 % Average monthly subscriber churn % 1.56 % 1.53 % 2.0 % Gross subscriber additions (in thousands) 4,316 4,124 192 4.7 % Subscriber disconnections (in thousands) 3,654 3,461 193 5.6 % Net subscriber additions (in thousands) 662 663 (1 ) (0.2 )% Average subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber (SAC) $ 813 $ 796 $ 17 2.1 % Capitalized subscriber leased equipment: Subscriber leased equipment subscriber acquisitions $ 713 $ 651 $ 62 9.5 % Subscriber leased equipment upgrade and retention 315 316 (1 ) (0.3 )% Total subscriber leased equipment capitalized $ 1,028 $ 967 $ 61 6.3 % Depreciation expense subscriber leased equipment $ 903 $ 1,145 $ (242 ) (21.1 )% Subscribers. In 2011, net subscriber additions were relatively unchanged as higher gross additions mainly resulting from improved customer offers were offset 41 Table of Contents DIRECTV by an increase in the monthly churn rate, which resulted primarily from a more competitive environment. Revenues. Our revenues increased as a result of higher ARPU and the larger subscriber base. The increase in ARPU resulted primarily from price increases on programming packages, higher set top receiver lease fees, higher advanced service fees, higher premium channel buy rates and an increase in NFL SUNDAY TICKET revenues, partially offset by higher promotional offers to new and existing subscribers. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization was higher in 2011 as compared to 2010 as increased revenues were partially offset by higher broadcasting programming costs, increased subscriber acquisition costs and higher upgrade and retention costs. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010 as the revenue growth was more than offset by higher relative growth in broadcast programming and other costs. Broadcast programming and other costs increased primarily due to annual program supplier rate increases, higher costs resulting from our new NFL SUNDAY TICKET contract, which went into effect with the 2011 season and the larger number of subscribers. Subscriber service expenses increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to service quality improvement initiatives and the higher number of subscribers. Subscriber acquisition costs and SAC per subscriber, which includes the cost of capitalized set top receivers, increased primarily due to higher subscriber demand for advanced products, as well as higher gross additions and increased dealer commissions, partially offset by lower marketing costs. Upgrade and retention costs increased in 2011 due to a higher installation costs associated with higher advanced equipment upgrades. General and administrative expenses increased in 2011 primarily due to increased labor and benefit costs related to higher incentive compensation and increased headcount, as well as higher bad debt expense associated with higher revenue, partially offset by a decrease in property tax expenses. Operating profit. Operating profit and operating profit margin increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to lower depreciation and amortization expense in 2011 resulting from the change in HD set top receiver estimated depreciable life from three to four years, lower depreciation expense associated with a reduction in capitalized set top receivers over the last several years and the completion of the amortization of a subscriber related intangible asset, partially offset by lower operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin. DIRECTV Latin America Segment The following table provides operating results and a summary of key subscriber data for the DIRECTV Latin America segment: Change 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Subscriber Amounts) Revenues $ 5,096 $ 3,597 $ 1,499 41.7 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization 1,663 1,164 499 42.9 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin 32.6 % 32.4 % Operating profit 916 623 293 47.0 % Operating profit margin 18.0 % 17.3 % Other data: ARPU $ 62.64 $ 57.95 $ 4.69 8.1 % Average monthly total subscriber churn % 1.78 % 1.77 % 0.6 % Average monthly post paid subscriber churn % 1.42 % 1.47 % (3.4 )% Total number of subscribers (in thousands) (1) 7,871 5,808 2,063 35.5 % Gross subscriber additions (in thousands) 3,510 2,318 1,192 51.4 % Net subscriber additions (in thousands) 2,063 1,220 843 69.1 % (1)DIRECTV Latin America subscriber data exclude subscribers of the Sky Mexico platform. Subscribers. The increase in gross subscriber additions was primarily due to higher demand for our middle market products, primarily in Brazil, as well as increased gross subscriber additions in Argentina. Net subscriber additions increased in 2011 due to the higher gross subscriber additions and lower post paid churn in Venezuela and Brazil compared to 2010. Revenues. Revenues increased due to strong subscriber and ARPU growth across the region, particularly in Brazil. ARPU increased primarily due to price 42 Table of Contents DIRECTV increases and higher penetration of advanced products across the region, as well as favorable exchange rates in Brazil. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization increased in 2011 as compared to 2010, primarily due to the increased gross profit generated from the higher revenues, partially offset by higher subscriber acquisition costs due to the higher number of gross subscriber additions, higher general and administrative costs as well as higher upgrade and retention costs resulting from the increased demand for advanced products. Operating profit. Operating profit increased in 2011 as compared to 2010, primarily due to higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization, discussed above, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from an increase in basic and advanced product receivers capitalized due to the higher gross subscriber additions attained over the last year. Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other Operating profit from Sports Networks, Elimination and Other increased to $11 million in 2011 from a $17 million operating loss in 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Consolidated Results of Operations We discuss changes for each of our segments in more detail below. Revenues. The following table presents our revenues by segment: Revenues by segment: Change 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 20,268 $ 18,671 $ 1,597 8.6 % DIRECTV Latin America 3,597 2,878 719 25.0 % Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other 237 16 221 NM Total Revenues $ 24,102 $ 21,565 $ 2,537 11.8 % The increase in our total revenues was due to subscriber growth and higher ARPU at DIRECTV U.S., subscriber growth at DIRECTV Latin America, as well as the revenue generated by DIRECTV Sports Networks which we acquired in November 2009. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization. The following table presents our operating profit (loss) before depreciation and amortization by segment: Operating profit (loss) before depreciation and amortization by segment: Change 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 5,216 $ 4,685 $ 531 11.3 % DIRECTV Latin America 1,164 697 467 67.0 % Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other (2 ) (69 ) 67 NM Total operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 6,378 $ 5,313 $ 1,065 20.0 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin 26.5 % 24.6 % The increase in total operating profit before depreciation and amortization was due to higher gross profit from the increase in revenues, lower charges in 2010 for foreign currency transactions at DIRECTV Latin America, offset by higher subscriber acquisition costs and upgrade and retention costs at both DIRECTV U.S and DIRECTV Latin America and higher general and administrative expenses at DIRECTV U.S. 43  Table of Contents DIRECTV Operating profit. The following table presents our operating profit (loss) by segment: Operating profit (loss) by segment: Change 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in Millions) DIRECTV U.S. $ 3,290 $ 2,410 $ 880 36.5 % DIRECTV Latin America 623 331 292 88.2 % Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other (17 ) (68 ) 51 NM Total operating profit $ 3,896 $ 2,673 $ 1,223 45.8 % Operating profit margin 16.2 % 12.4 % The increase in our operating profit was primarily due to the changes in operating profit before depreciation and amortization discussed above and lower depreciation and amortization expense at DIRECTV U.S. due to the completion of amortization of intangible assets and declining subscriber equipment capitalization, partially offset by increased depreciation at DIRECTV Latin America due to increased subscriber equipment capitalization. Interest income. Interest income was $39 million in 2010 and $41 million in 2009. Interest expense. The increase in interest expense to $557 million in 2010 from $423 million in 2009 was due to an increase in the average debt balances compared to 2009, partially offset by decreased interest rates. We capitalized interest costs of $6 million in 2010 and $18 million in 2009. Liberty transaction and related gains (charges). In 2010, we recorded a $67 million net gain from the settlement of the equity collars and debt assumed as part of the Liberty Transaction. In 2009 we incurred $491 million in costs related to the Liberty Transaction, which is comprised of a $337 million premium paid to LEI stockholders, $111 million in net losses for the partial settlement and fair value adjustments related to the equity collars and non employee stock options and stock appreciation rights and $43 million of charges for transaction related costs. Other, net. The significant components of "Other, net" were as follows: 2010 2009 Change (Dollars in Millions) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries $ 90 $ 51 $ 39 Net foreign currency transaction gain 11 62 (51 ) Loss from impairment of investments (45 ) 45 Fair value adjustment loss on non employee stock options (11 ) (11 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt (16 ) (34 ) 18 Net gain from sale of investments 6 6 Other (11 ) (11 ) Total $ 69 $ 34 $ 35 In 2010, Other, net increased due primarily to increased equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries due to our investment in GSN, the recognition of a charge for the other than temporary impairment of investments in 2009, and reduced losses on the early extinguishment of debt in 2010, partially offset by lower foreign currency transaction gain related to net U.S. dollar denominated liabilities held by Sky Brazil and fair value adjustment loss on non employee stock options in connection with the Liberty Transaction completed in 2009. Income tax expense. The increase of income tax expense to $1,202 million in 2010 from $827 million in 2009 is primarily due to an increase in income before taxes, partially offset by tax benefits associated with the release of valuation allowances in certain foreign subsidiaries, multi state income tax planning and recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. The increase was also offset by higher tax expense in the prior year primarily attributable to the non deductibility of the Liberty Transaction charge for tax purposes. Noncontrolling interests in net earnings of subsidiaries. We recognized noncontrolling interest in net earnings of subsidiaries of $114 million in 2010 and $65 million in 2009 at Sky Brazil. Noncontrolling interest in net earnings of subsidiaries in 2010 increased due to higher net income at Sky Brazil and a net tax benefit attributable to the noncontrolling interest resulting from the release of a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance. 44 Table of Contents DIRECTV Earnings Per Share. Class A common stock earnings per share (DIRECTV Group common stock for the period January 1, 2009 through November 19, 2009) and weighted shares outstanding were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2010 2009 (Shares in Millions) Basic earnings attributable to DIRECTV Class A common stockholders per common share $ 2.31 $ 0.96 Diluted earnings attributable to DIRECTV Class A common stockholders per common share 2.30 0.95 Weighted average number of Class A common shares outstanding Basic 870 982 Diluted 876 989 The increases in basic and diluted earnings per share for Class A common stock were due to higher net income attributable to DIRECTV, the charge recorded for the Liberty Transaction in 2009 and a reduction in weighted shares outstanding resulting from our share repurchase program and the effect of the Liberty Transaction, partially offset by the $160 million inducement in 2010 paid in connection with the Malone Transaction. DIRECTV U.S. Segment The following table provides operating results and a summary of key subscriber data for the DIRECTV U.S. segment: Change 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Subscriber Amounts) Revenues $ 20,268 $ 18,671 $ 1,597 8.6 % Operating costs and expenses Costs of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense Broadcast programming and other 8,699 8,027 672 8.4 % Subscriber service expenses 1,340 1,268 72 5.7 % Broadcast operations expenses 273 274 (1 ) (0.4 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense Subscriber acquisition costs 2,631 2,478 153 6.2 % Upgrade and retention costs 1,106 1,045 61 5.8 % General and administrative expenses 1,003 894 109 12.2 % Depreciation and amortization expense $ 1,926 $ 2,275 $ (349 ) (15.3 )% Total operating costs and expenses 16,978 16,261 717 4.4 % Operating profit $ 3,290 $ 2,410 $ 880 36.5 % Operating profit margin 16.2 % 12.9 % Other data: Operating profit before depreciation and amortization $ 5,216 $ 4,685 $ 531 11.3 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin 25.7 % 25.1 % Total number of subscribers (in thousands) 19,223 18,560 663 3.6 % ARPU $ 89.71 $ 85.48 $ 4.23 4.9 % Average monthly subscriber churn % 1.53 % 1.53 % % Gross subscriber additions (in thousands) 4,124 4,273 (149 ) (3.5 )% Subscriber disconnections (in thousands) 3,461 3,334 127 3.8 % Net subscriber additions (in thousands) 663 939 (276 ) (29.4 )% Average subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber (SAC) $ 796 $ 712 $ 84 11.8 % Capitalized subscriber leased equipment: Subscriber leased equipment subscriber acquisitions $ 651 $ 564 $ 87 15.4 % Subscriber leased equipment upgrade and retention 316 419 (103 ) (24.6 )% Total subscriber leased equipment capitalized $ 967 $ 983 $ (16 ) (1.6 )% Depreciation expense subscriber leased equipment $ 1,145 $ 1,333 $ (188 ) (14.1 )% Subscribers. In 2010, gross subscriber additions decreased primarily due to the impact of the transition to digital broadcast in 2009 and lower additions from our 45 Table of Contents DIRECTV regional telco partners as a result of a more challenging competitive environment. Net subscriber additions decreased from 2009 due to the decrease in gross additions and higher subscriber disconnections associated with the larger subscriber base. Average monthly subscriber churn remained unchanged from 1.53% in 2009. Revenues. Our revenues increased as a result of higher ARPU and the larger subscriber base. The increase in ARPU resulted primarily from price increases on programming packages, higher HD and DVR service fees. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization. The improvement of operating profit before depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the gross profit generated from the higher revenues, partially offset by higher subscriber acquisition and upgrade and retention costs and higher general and administrative expenses. Broadcast programming and other costs increased due to the larger number of subscribers in 2010 and annual program supplier rate increases. Subscriber service expenses increased primarily due to a larger subscriber base in 2010 and costs associated with service quality improvement initiatives. Subscriber acquisition costs increased from 2009 primarily due to higher subscriber demand for advanced products as well as increased dealer commissions. SAC per subscriber, which includes the cost of capitalized set top receivers, increased primarily due to higher subscriber demand for advanced products and increased dealer commissions compared to 2009. Upgrade and retention costs increased in 2010 due to increased marketing costs and costs related to advanced product upgrades. The decrease in the capitalized amount of set top receivers is due to a decrease in the cost of advanced products. General and administrative expenses increased in 2010 primarily due to increased labor and benefit costs related to higher incentive compensation and increased headcount as well as higher bad debt expense associated with higher revenue. Operating profit. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization and lower depreciation and amortization expense in 2010 as a result of decreased subscriber equipment capitalization and completion of the amortization of subscriber related and orbital slot intangible assets. DIRECTV Latin America Segment The following table provides operating results and a summary of key subscriber data for the DIRECTV Latin America segment: Change 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Subscriber Amounts) Revenues $ 3,597 $ 2,878 $ 719 25.0 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization 1,164 697 467 67.0 % Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin 32.4 % 24.2 % Operating profit 623 331 292 88.2 % Operating profit margin 17.3 % 11.5 % Other data: ARPU $ 57.95 $ 57.12 $ 0.83 1.5 % Average monthly total subscriber churn % 1.77 % 1.75 % 1.1 % Average monthly post paid subscriber churn % 1.47 % 1.55 % (5.2 )% Total number of subscribers (in thousands) (1) 5,808 4,588 1,220 26.6 % Gross subscriber additions (in thousands) 2,318 1,575 743 47.2 % Net subscriber additions (in thousands) 1,220 692 528 76.3 % (1)DIRECTV Latin America subscriber data exclude subscribers of the Sky Mexico platform. Net subscriber additions and churn exclude the effect of the migration of approximately 3,000 subscribers to Sky Mexico and the migration of approximately 16,000 subscribers from a local pay television service provider to Sky Brazil in 2009. Gross subscriber additions increased in 2010 principally due to continued strong demand for advanced products and prepaid services, the effect of the FIFA World Cup soccer tournament as well as targeted customer promotions aimed at the middle market segments. The increase in net subscriber additions was due to higher gross subscriber additions primarily in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador and Chile. Revenues increased in 2010 primarily due to strong subscriber growth. ARPU increased mainly due to price increases and higher fees for HD and DVR services, 46 Table of Contents DIRECTV partially offset by the effect of the devaluation in Venezuela and the increased penetration of the middle market segment. The higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization was primarily from the increased gross profit generated from the higher revenues, coupled with lower general and administrative expenses primarily due to a decrease of $191 million in the charges related to the exchange of Venezuelan currency. This was partially offset by an increase in subscriber acquisition costs due to a higher number of gross subscriber additions. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from an increase in basic and advanced product receivers capitalized related to the higher gross subscriber additions attained over the last year. Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other Operating loss from Sports Networks, Elimination and Other decreased to $17 million in 2010 from $68 million in 2009. Sports Networks, Eliminations and Other primarily consisted of corporate operating costs until November 19, 2009 when we completed the Liberty Transaction and acquired the RSNs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents and the cash flow that we generate from our operations. We expect that net cash provided by operating activities will grow and believe that our existing cash balances and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund our existing business plan. Additionally, in February 2011, DIRECTV U.S. entered into a new $2 billion revolving credit facility, which is available until 2016. In January 2012, we borrowed $400 million under the revolving credit facility. We may borrow additional funds under this facility to fund share repurchases or to fund strategic investment opportunities should they arise. At December 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $873 million compared with $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010. As a measure of liquidity, the current ratio (ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 0.89 at December 31, 2011 and 0.96 at December 31, 2010. Working capital decreased by $305 million to a $502 million deficit at December 31, 2011 from a deficit of $197 million at December 31, 2010. The decrease during the year was mostly due to the decrease in our cash and cash equivalents resulting from our share repurchase program and an increase in cash paid for property, equipment and satellites, as well as an increase in accounts payable, primarily due to amounts payable to our programmers. These decreases in working capital were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and an increase in prepaid expenses. Summary Cash Flow Information Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in Millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,185 $ 5,206 $ 4,431 Net cash used in investing activities (3,022 ) (3,099 ) (2,194 ) Net cash used in financing activities (2,792 ) (3,210 ) (1,637 ) Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,185 $ 5,206 $ 4,431 Less: Cash paid for property, equipment and satellites (3,170 ) (2,416 ) (2,071 ) Free cash flow $ 2,015 $ 2,790 $ 2,360 Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 and 2010 were relatively flat as higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization was more than offset by increased cash paid for interest and taxes and the decrease in working capital discussed above. The increases in net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to our higher operating profit before depreciation and amortization, which resulted from the higher gross profit generated from an increase in revenues. Cash paid for income taxes was $1,042 million in 2011, $705 million in 2010 and $484 million in 2009. The increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2011 resulted mainly from increased income before income taxes as well as the utilization of tax credit carryforwards in 2010. The increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2010 resulted mainly from increased income from income before income taxes and prior year tax credits taken in 2009. Cash paid for interest was $687 million in 2011, $460 million in 2010 and $412 million in 47 Table of Contents DIRECTV 2009. The increase in cash paid for interest is due to the increase in our average debt outstanding. Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities From 2010 to 2011, capital expenditures for set top receivers at DIRECTV U.S. increased primarily due to an increase in gross subscriber additions. From 2009 to 2010, capital expenditures for set top receivers at DIRECTV U.S. remained relatively consistent. From 2009 to 2011, we have continued to control capital expenditures by being able to lower average costs to produce set top receivers and by refurbishing previously used set top receivers. During 2009, 2010 and 2011, DIRECTV U.S. was in the process of constructing three satellites. One of these satellites has been completed and placed into service. We expect to place the other two satellites in service in the 2014. Capital expenditures in Latin America for set top receivers provided to subscribers increased during 2009, 2010 and 2011. Part of our business strategy in Latin America is to increase advanced product and multi box installations; therefore, our capital expenditures in Latin America are expected to continue to increase. During 2011, DIRECTV Latin America entered into a contract to lease two satellites for PanAmericana, ISDLA 1 and 2, which are expected to be launched in 2014 and 2015. As a part of the lease agreement, we are required to make prepayments prior to the launch and commencement of the lease term. Payments related to the lease agreement totaled $104 million for 2011, and are included in "Cash paid for satellites" in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This transaction is described in Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Additionally, in 2010, we paid $617 million for investments in companies, net of cash acquired, primarily for the purchase of an approximate 19% interest in Sky Brazil held by Globo. We paid $11 million in 2011 and $37 million in 2009 for investments, net of cash acquired, in various other companies and $97 million, net of cash acquired, as part of the Liberty Transaction in 2009. These transactions are described in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Our cash spending on investment in companies is discretionary and we may fund strategic investment opportunities should they arise in the future. Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities Under stock repurchase plans approved by our Board of Directors, we completed the repurchase of our Class A common stock as follows: $5,496 million in 2011, $5,111 million in 2010, $1,696 million during 2009. In the first quarter of 2012, we announced a new repurchase program authorization of an additional $6 billion. We may make purchases under this program in the open market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing, nature and amount of such transactions will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and the program may be suspended, discontinued or accelerated at any time. The sources of funds for the purchases under the remaining authorization are our existing cash on hand, cash from operations and potential additional borrowings. During 2011, we had $3,990 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. We also repaid $1,000 million of our long term debt during 2011. During 2010, we had $5,978 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. We also repaid $2,323 million of our long term debt, and paid $1,537 million to settle the debt and related equity collars assumed as part of the Liberty Transaction. During 2009, we had $1,990 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. We also repaid $1,018 million of our long term debt, and paid $751 million to settle a portion of the debt and related equity collars assumed as part of the Liberty Transaction. We anticipate additional borrowings in the future in order to maintain our target of outstanding long term debt of 2.5 times our operating profit before depreciation and amortization of DIRECTV on a consolidated basis; however, we will evaluate our optimal leverage target on an ongoing basis. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to an an increase in capital expenditures and relatively flat net cash provided by operating activities described above. The increase in capital expenditures resulted primarily from an increase in subscriber leased equipment, satellite and other infrastructure primarily at DIRECTV Latin America. Debt At December 31, 2011, we had $13,464 million in total outstanding borrowings, bearing a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%. Our outstanding 48 Table of Contents DIRECTV borrowings consist of notes payable issued by DIRECTV U.S. as more fully described in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Part II of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. Our senior notes payable mature as follows: $1,000 million in 2014, $1,200 million in 2015, $3,750 million in 2016 and $7,550 million thereafter. All of our senior notes were issued by DIRECTV Holdings LLC and DIRECTV Financing Co., Inc., or the Co Issuers, and have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On November 14, 2011, we entered into a series of Supplemental Indentures whereby DIRECTV agreed to fully guarantee all of the senior notes, jointly and severally with substantially all of DIRECTV Holdings LLCs domestic subsidiaries. The Supplemental Indentures provide that DIRECTV unconditionally guarantees that the principal and interest on the respective senior notes will be paid in full when due and that the obligations of the Co Issuers to the holders of the outstanding senior notes will be performed. As a result of the guarantees, holders of the senior notes have the benefit of DIRECTVs interests in the assets and related earnings of our operations that are not held through DIRECTV Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries. Those operations are primarily our direct to home digital television services throughout Latin America which are held by DIRECTV Latin America Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries and DIRECTV Sports Networks LLC and its subsidiaries which are comprised primarily of three regional sports television networks based in Seattle, Washington; Denver, Colorado; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. However, the subsidiaries that own and operate the DIRECTV Latin America and DIRECTV Sports Networks operating segments have not guaranteed the senior notes. The guarantees are unsecured senior obligations of DIRECTV and rank equally in right of payment with all of DIRECTVs existing and future senior debt and rank senior in right of payment to all of DIRECTVs future subordinated debt, if any. The guarantees are effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured obligations, if any, of DIRECTV to the extent of the value of the assets securing the obligations. DIRECTV will not be subject to the covenants contained in each indenture of the senior notes and our guarantees will terminate and be released on the terms set forth in each of the senior notes. Revolving Credit Facility In February 2011, DIRECTV U.S. $500 million, six year senior secured credit facility was terminated and replaced with a new five year, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. We pay a commitment fee of 0.30% per year for the unused commitment under the revolving credit facility, and borrowings will bear interest at an annual rate of (i) the London interbank offer rate (LIBOR) (or for Euro advances the EURIBOR rate) plus 1.50% or, at our option (ii) the higher of the prime rate plus 0.50% or the Fed Funds Rate plus 1.00%. The commitment fee and the annual interest rate may be increased or decreased under certain conditions, which include changes in DIRECTV U.S. long term, unsecured debt ratings. The revolving credit facility has been fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by substantially all of DIRECTV U.S. domestic subsidiaries on a senior unsecured basis. In January 2012, we borrowed $400 million under our revolving credit facility. Covenants and Restrictions. The revolving credit facility requires DIRECTV U.S. to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a specified ratio of indebtedness to adjusted net income. The revolving credit facility also includes covenants that restrict DIRECTV U.S. ability to, among other things, (i) incur additional subsidiary indebtedness, (ii) incur liens, (iii) enter into certain transactions with affiliates, (iv) merge or consolidate with another entity, (v) sell, assign, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, and (vi) change its lines of business. Additionally, the senior notes contain restrictive covenants that are similar. Should DIRECTV U.S. fail to comply with these covenants, all or a portion of its borrowings under the senior notes could become immediately payable and its revolving credit facility could be terminated. As of December 31, 2011, DIRECTV U.S. management believes they are in compliance with all such covenants. The senior notes and revolving credit facility also provide that the borrowings may be required to be prepaid if certain change in control events occur. Contingencies Venezuela devaluation and exchange controls. In January 2010, the Venezuelan government announced the creation of a dual exchange rate system, including an exchange rate of 4.3 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar for most of the activities of our Venezuelan operations compared to an exchange rate of 2.15 Venezuelan bolivars fuerte prior to the announcement. As a result of this devaluation, we recorded a $6 million charge to net income in the year ended December 31, 2010 related to 49 Table of Contents DIRECTV the adjustment of net bolivars fuerte denominated monetary assets to the new official exchange rate. We began reporting the operating results of our Venezuelan subsidiary in the first quarter of 2010 using the devalued rate of 4.3 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar. In December 2010, the Venezuelan government announced the elimination of the dual exchange rate system, eliminating the 2.6 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar preferential rate which was available for certain activities. Companies operating in Venezuela are required to obtain Venezuelan government approval to exchange Venezuelan bolivars fuerte into U.S. dollars at the official rate. We have not been able to consistently exchange Venezuelan bolivars fuerte into U.S. dollars at the official rate and as a result, we have relied on a parallel exchange process to settle U.S. dollar obligations and to repatriate accumulated cash balances prior to its close. The rates implied by transactions in the parallel market, which was closed in May 2010, were significantly higher than the official rate (6 to 7 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar). As a result, we recorded a $22 million charge in 2010, and a $213 million charge in 2009 in "General and administrative expenses" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in connection with the exchange of accumulated Venezuelan cash balances to U.S. dollars using the parallel exchange process. As a result of the closing of the parallel exchange process in May 2010, we have been unable to repatriate excess cash balances and as a result, we have realized no charges for the repatriation of cash in 2011. Our ability to pay U.S. dollar denominated obligations and repatriate cash generated in Venezuela in excess of local operating requirements is limited, resulting in an increase in the cash balance at our Venezuelan subsidiary. At such time that exchange controls are eased, accumulated cash balances may ultimately be repatriated at less than their currently reported value, as the official exchange rate has not changed despite continuing high inflation in Venezuela. In addition, in the event of a significant devaluation of the bolivar fuerte, we may recognize a charge to earnings based on the amount of bolivar fuerte denominated net monetary assets (monetary assets net of monetary liabilities) held at the time of such devaluation. These conditions are also expected to affect growth in our Venezuelan business which is dependent on our ability to purchase set top boxes and other components using U.S. dollars. Using the official 4.3 bolivars fuerte per U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2011, our Venezuelan subsidiary had net Venezuelan bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets of $285 million, including cash of $401 million as of December 31, 2011. Income taxes. During 2010, we entered into an agreement with a former owner to settle certain tax contingencies. As a result of this settlement we recorded a benefit of $39 million in "Income tax expense" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2010. We engage in continuous discussions and negotiations with federal, state, and foreign taxing authorities and reevaluate our uncertain tax positions, and, while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter or tax position, we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to approximately $180 million during the next twelve months. Globo. As discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, Globo has the right to exchange its remaining Sky Brazil shares for cash or our common shares. If Globo exercises this right, we have the option to elect to pay the consideration in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of both. Other. Several factors may affect our ability to fund our operations and commitments that we discuss in "Contractual Obligations", "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements" and "Contingencies" below. In addition, our future cash flows may be reduced if we experience, among other things, significantly higher subscriber additions than planned, increased subscriber churn or upgrade and retention costs, higher than planned capital expenditures for satellites and broadcast equipment, or satellite anomalies or signal theft. Additionally, DIRECTV U.S. ability to borrow under its revolving credit facility is contingent upon DIRECTV U.S. meeting a financial and other covenants associated with its facility as more fully described above. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, including the future periods in which payments are expected. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 referenced in the table. The contractual obligations below do not include payments that could be made related to our net unrecognized tax benefits liability, which amounted to $394 million as of December 31, 2011. The timing and amount of any future payments is not reasonably estimable, as such payments are dependent on the completion and 50 Table of Contents DIRECTV resolution of examinations with tax authorities. We do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations within the next twelve months. Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Dollars in Millions) Long term debt obligations (Note 10) (a) $ 21,781 $ 704 $ 2,408 $ 6,100 $ 12,569 Purchase obligations (Note 20) (b) 8,258 2,409 3,509 1,154 1,186 Operating lease obligations (Note 20) (c) 846 73 143 137 493 Capital lease obligations (Notes 12 and 20) (d) 1,551 95 182 254 1,020 Total $ 32,436 $ 3,281 $ 6,242 $ 7,645 $ 15,268 (a)Long term debt obligations include interest calculated based on the rates in effect at December 31, 2011, however, the obligations do not reflect potential prepayments required under indentures. (b)Purchase obligations consist primarily of broadcast programming commitments, regional professional team rights agreements, service contract commitments and satellite construction and launch contracts. Broadcast programming commitments include guaranteed minimum contractual commitments that are typically based on a flat fee or a minimum number of required subscribers subscribing to the related programming. Actual payments may exceed the minimum payment requirements if the actual number of subscribers subscribing to the related programming exceeds the minimum amounts. Service contract commitments include minimum commitments for the purchase of services that have been outsourced to third parties, such as billing services, telemetry, tracking and control services and broadcast center services. In most cases, actual payments, which are typically based on volume, usually exceed these minimum amounts. (c)Certain of the operating leases contain variable escalation clauses and renewal or purchase options, which we do not consider in the amounts disclosed. (d)Capital lease obligations includes obligations related to the ISDLA 1 and ISDLA 2 satellites discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2011, we were contingently liable under standby letters of credit and bonds in the aggregate amount of $136 million, primarily related to a judicial deposit in Brazil for the ECAD matter discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report and insurance deductibles. CONTINGENCIES For a discussion of "Contingencies", see Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS For a discussion of "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions," see Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported for future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represents what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them, which are presented below. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Income Taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining provisions for income taxes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, tax benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. 51 Table of Contents DIRECTV We assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets at each reporting date and where applicable, record a valuation allowance to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized in the future. Our assessment includes an analysis of whether deferred tax assets will be realized in the ordinary course of operations based on the available positive and negative evidence, including the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and forecasted income from operating activities. The underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment. In the event that actual income from operating activities differs from forecasted amounts, or if we change our estimates of forecasted income from operating activities, we could record additional charges or reduce allowances in order to adjust the carrying value of deferred tax assets to their realizable amount. Such adjustments could be material to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, the recognition of a tax benefit for tax positions involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We provide for taxes for uncertain tax positions where assessments have not been received. We believe such tax reserves are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, we adjust these amounts only when more information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. Future events such as changes in the facts or law, judicial decisions regarding the application of existing law or a favorable audit outcome will result in changes to the amounts provided. Contingent Matters. Determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingent matter, including but not limited to legal and tax issues, and the amount of such accrual, if any, requires a significant amount of management judgment and estimation. We develop our judgments and estimates in consultation with outside counsel based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter, we could record a charge in a future period that would be material to our consolidated financial statements. Depreciable Lives of Leased Set Top Receivers. We currently lease most set top receivers provided to new and existing subscribers and therefore capitalize the cost of those set top receivers. We depreciate set top receivers at DIRECTV U.S. over a three to four year estimated useful life, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Changes in the estimated useful lives of set top receivers capitalized could result in significant changes to the amounts recorded as depreciation expense. If we extended the depreciable life of the set top receivers at DIRECTV U.S. by one year, it would result in an approximately $300 million reduction in annual depreciation expense. Valuation of Long Lived Assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We consider the carrying value of a long lived asset impaired when the anticipated undiscounted future cash flow from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset. We determine fair value primarily using the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved, and other valuation techniques. We determine losses on long lived assets to be disposed of in a similar manner, except that we reduce the fair value for the cost of disposal. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances change that would more likely than not result in an impairment loss. We completed our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2011, and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of each reporting unit and our intangible assets with indefinite lives significantly exceed their carrying values. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. The goodwill evaluation requires the estimation of the fair value of reporting units where we record goodwill. We determine fair values primarily using estimated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved, when appropriate. Estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgment about future operating results, and can vary significantly from one evaluation to the next. Risk adjusted discount rates are not fixed and are subject to change over time. As a result, changes in estimated future cash flows and or changes in discount rates 52 Table of Contents DIRECTV could result in a write down of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For a discussion of accounting changes and new accounting pronouncements see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, which we incorporate herein by reference. KEY TERMINOLOGY Revenues. We earn revenues mostly from monthly fees we charge subscribers for subscriptions to basic and premium channel programming, HD programming and access fees, pay per view programming, and seasonal and live sporting events. We also earn revenues from monthly fees that we charge subscribers with multiple non leased set top receivers (which we refer to as mirroring fees), monthly fees we charge subscribers for leased set top receivers, monthly fees we charge subscribers for DVR service, hardware revenues from subscribers who lease or purchase set top receivers from us, warranty service fees and advertising services. Revenues are reported net of customer credits and discounted promotions. Broadcast Programming and Other. These costs primarily include license fees for subscription service programming, pay per view programming, live sports and other events. Other costs include continuing service fees paid to third parties for active subscribers and warranty service costs. Subscriber Service Expenses. Subscriber service expenses include the costs of customer call centers, billing, remittance processing and certain home services expenses, such as in home repair costs. Broadcast Operations Expenses. These expenses include broadcast center operating costs, signal transmission expenses (including costs of collecting signals for our local channel offerings), and costs of monitoring, maintaining and insuring our satellites. Also included are engineering expenses associated with deterring theft of our signal. Subscriber Acquisition Costs. These costs include the cost of set top receivers and other equipment, commissions we pay to national retailers, independent satellite television retailers, dealers and telcos, and the cost of installation, advertising, marketing and customer call center expenses associated with the acquisition of new subscribers. Set top receivers leased to new subscribers are capitalized in "Property and equipment, net" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciated over their useful lives. In certain countries in Latin America, where our customer agreements provide for the lease of the entire DIRECTV or SKY System, we also capitalize the costs of the other customer premises equipment and related installation costs. The amount of set top receivers capitalized each period for subscriber acquisitions is included in "Cash paid for property and equipment" in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Upgrade and Retention Costs. Upgrade and retention costs are associated with upgrade efforts for existing subscribers that we believe will result in higher average monthly revenue per subscriber, or ARPU, and lower churn. Our upgrade efforts include subscriber equipment upgrade programs for DVR, HD and HD DVR receivers and local channels, our multiple set top receiver offers and similar initiatives. Retention costs also include the costs of installing and providing hardware under our movers program for subscribers relocating to a new residence. Set top receivers leased to existing subscribers under upgrade and retention programs are capitalized in "Property and equipment, net" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciated over their useful lives. The amount of set top receivers capitalized each period for upgrade and retention programs is included in "Cash paid for property and equipment" in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include departmental costs for legal, administrative services, finance, marketing and information technology. These costs also include expenses for bad debt and other operating expenses, such as legal settlements, and gains or losses from the sale or disposal of fixed assets. Average Monthly Revenue Per Subscriber. We calculate ARPU by dividing average monthly revenues for the period (total revenues during the period divided by the number of months in the period) by average subscribers for the period. We calculate average subscribers for the period by adding the number of subscribers as of the beginning of the period and for each quarter end in the current year or period and dividing by the sum of the number of quarters in the period plus one. Average Monthly Subscriber Churn. Average monthly subscriber churn represents the number of subscribers whose service is disconnected, expressed as a 53 Table of Contents DIRECTV percentage of the average total number of subscribers. We calculate average monthly subscriber churn by dividing the average monthly number of disconnected subscribers for the period (total subscribers disconnected, net of reconnects, during the period divided by the number of months in the period) by average subscribers for the period. Subscriber Count. The total number of subscribers represents the total number of subscribers actively subscribing to our service, including subscribers who have suspended their account for a particular season of the year because they are temporarily away from their primary residence and subscribers who are in the process of relocating and commercial equivalent viewing units. SAC. We calculate SAC, which represents total subscriber acquisition costs stated on a per subscriber basis, by dividing total subscriber acquisition costs for the period by the number of gross new subscribers acquired during the period. We calculate total subscriber acquisition costs for the period by adding together "Subscriber acquisition costs" expensed during the period and the amount of cash paid for equipment leased to new subscribers during the period. *** 54 Table of Contents DIRECTV  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses referred to below include forward looking statements of market risk which assume for analytical purposes that certain adverse market conditions may occur. Actual future market conditions may differ materially from such assumptions and the amounts noted below are the result of analyses used for the purpose of assessing possible risks and the mitigation thereof. Accordingly, you should not consider the forward looking statements as our projections of future events or losses. General Our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and changes in the market value of our equity investments. We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet our risk management objectives, and do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Risk We generally conduct our business in U.S. dollars with some business conducted in a variety of foreign currencies and therefore we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Accordingly, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, commitments and anticipated foreign currency transactions. The gains and losses on derivative foreign exchange contracts offset changes in value of the related exposures. As of December 31, 2011, we had no significant foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding. The impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in exchange rates on our net assets would be a loss of $150 million, net of taxes, at December 31, 2011, a significant portion of which would be recorded in "Foreign currency translation activity during the period" in our Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity (Deficit) and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest. Interest Rate Risk From time to time, we may be subject to fluctuating interest rates for variable rate borrowings, which may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. We had outstanding debt of $13,464 million at December 31, 2011, which mostly consisted of DIRECTV U.S. fixed rate borrowings. *** 55  Table of Contents DIRECTV
