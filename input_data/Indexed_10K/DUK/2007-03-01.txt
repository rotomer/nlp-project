Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. INTRODUCTION Managements Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 2006 Objectives. Duke Energys objectives for 2006, as outlined in the 2006 Charter, consisted of the following: Establish an industry leading electric power platform through successful execution of the merger with Cinergy; Deliver on the 2006 financial objectives and position Duke Energy for growth in 2007 and beyond; Complete the exit of the former DENA business and pursue strategic portfolio opportunities; Build a high performance culture focused on safety, diversity and inclusion, employee development, leadership and results; and Build credibility through leadership on key policy issues, transparent communications and excellent customer service. During 2006, management executed on its objectives primarily through strategically completed and pending acquisitions, as well as dispositions of certain businesses with higher risk profiles, such as the former DENA operations outside the Midwest and the Cinergy commercial marketing and trading businesses. During 2006, Duke Energy created a business model that would give both Duke Energys electric and gas businesses stand alone strength and additional scope and scale along with steady and stable earnings growth. On April 3, 2006, Duke Energy and Cinergy consummated the previously announced merger, which combined the Duke Energy and Cinergy regulated franchises as well as deregulated generation in the Midwestern United States. The merger with Cinergy increased the size and scope of Duke Energys electric utility operations. Duke Energy management expects to achieve numerous synergies, both immediately and over time, in all regions impacted by the merger. As a result of the additional size and scope of the electric utility operations discussed above, in June 2006, the Board of Directors of Duke Energy authorized management to pursue a plan to create two separate publicly traded companies by spinning off Duke Energys natural gas businesses to Duke Energy shareholders, which was completed on January 2, 2007. The new natural gas company, Spectra Energy, consists of Duke Energys Natural Gas Transmission business segment, including Union Gas, as well as Duke Energys 50 percent ownership interest in DEFS. The spin off of the natural gas business is expected to deliver long term value to shareholders as the two stand alone companies are expected to be able to more easily participate in growth opportunities in their own industries as well as the gas and power industry consolidations. In connection with the effort to reduce the risk profile of Duke Energy and to focus on businesses that can be expected to contribute steady, stable earnings growth, during 2006 Duke Energy finalized the sale of the former DENA power generation fleet outside of the Midwest to LS Power and the sale of the Cinergy commercial marketing and trading business to Fortis, a Benelux based financial services group (Fortis). Additionally, the Board of Directors of Duke Energy authorized management to explore the potential value of bringing in a joint venture partner at Crescent to expand the business and create a platform for increased growth. On September 7, 2006, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy closed an agreement to create the Crescent JV with MS Members. As a result of the Crescent transaction, Duke Energy no longer controls the Crescent JV and on September 7, 2006 deconsolidated its investment in Crescent and subsequently accounts for its investment in the Crescent JV utilizing the equity method of accounting. After completion of the spin off of the natural gas businesses, the primary businesses remaining in Duke Energy in 2007 are the U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas business segment, the Commercial Power business segment, the International Energy business segment and Duke Energys effective 50% interest in the Crescent JV, which management currently expects to continue to be a reportable business segment. Duke Energy announced an agreement with Southern Company to evaluate the potential construction of a new nuclear power plant at a site jointly owned in Cherokee County, South Carolina. Additionally, Duke Energy continues to evaluate other opportunities to re invest in the electric utility operations, by modernizing older coal fired plants in the Carolinas and exploring the replacement of an aging coal plant in Indiana with a coal gasification plant. Also, during the fourth quarter of 2006, Duke Energy closed on a transaction to acquire from Dynegy a 825 megawatt power plant located in Rockingham County, North Carolina. This peaking plant, which will primarily be used during times of high electricity demand, generally in the winter and summer months, will provide customers with competitively priced peaking capacity and helps to ensure Duke Energy can meet growing customer demands for electricity in the foreseeable future. Additionally, in 41 Table of Contents PART II December 2006 Duke Energy entered into an agreement to increase its ownership interest in the Catawba Nuclear Station for a purchase price of approximately $158 million. The purchase is subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions precedent and is expected to close prior to September 30, 2008. Effective with the third quarter 2006, the Board of Directors of Duke Energy approved a quarterly dividend increase of $0.01 per share, increasing the annual dividend to $1.28 per share. Additionally, during 2006 Duke Energy repurchased approximately 17.5 million shares of its common stock for approximately $500 million. In connection with the above mentioned plan to spin off Duke Energys natural gas businesses to Duke Energy shareholders, the share repurchase program was suspended. In October 2006, Duke Energys Board of Directors authorized the reactivation of the share repurchase plan for Duke Energy of up to $500 million of share repurchases subsequent to the spin off of the natural gas businesses on January 2, 2007. 2006 Financial Results. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Duke Energy reported earnings available for common stockholders of $1,863 million and basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.59 and $1.57, respectively, as compared to reported earnings available for common stockholders of $1,812 million and basic and diluted EPS of $1.94 and $1.88, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005. Earnings available for common stockholders for 2006 as compared to 2005 were fairly flat; however, basic and diluted EPS were negatively impacted by the issuance of approximately 313 million shares in April 2006 in connection with the Cinergy merger. The highlights for 2006 include the following: U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas experienced higher earnings in 2006 primarily as a result of the addition of the former Cinergy regulated utility operations in the Midwest. These higher results were partially offset by milder weather, the impact of rate reductions related to Cinergy merger approvals, and lower bulk power marketing results in the Carolinas. Natural Gas Transmissions results were flat from 2005 to 2006, but were affected by strong commodity prices related to processing activities and higher operating and maintenance expenses. Field Services experienced lower earnings in 2006 primarily as a result of the 2005 gains on the sale of the TEPPCO investments and the transfer of a 19.7 percent interest in DEFS to ConocoPhillips in July 2005, which resulted in the deconsolidation of the investment in DEFS. Results in 2006 were favorably affected by strong commodity prices. Commercial Power experienced higher earnings in 2006 primarily as a result of the addition of the former Cinergy non regulated generation operations in the Midwest, partially offset by the impacts of unfavorable purchase accounting charges as a result of recognizing the Cinergy assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values as of the date of merger. International Energy experienced lower earnings in 2006 primarily as a result of 2006 non cash charges related to a settlement related to the Citrus litigation, an impairment charge related to the investment in Campeche, and an impairment charge related to the sale of Bolivian assets. Crescent experienced higher earnings in 2006 primarily as a result of the gain recognized on the joint venture transaction in September 2006, which resulted in the deconsolidation of Duke Energys investment in the Crescent JV. Other experienced higher losses in 2006 primarily as a result of 2006 charges related to contract settlement negotiations, and costs to achieve the Cinergy merger and the spin off of the natural gas businesses. Income tax expense from continuing operations was lower in 2006 as a result of a decrease in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and a reduction in the effective tax rate. The reduction in the effective tax rate was primarily a result of favorable tax settlements on research and development costs and nuclear decommissioning costs, tax benefits related to the impairment of the investment in Bolivia, and tax credits recognized on synthetic fuel operations. During 2006, Duke Energy recognized net of tax losses of $156 million in discontinued operations, as compared to net of tax losses of $701 million in 2005. During 2006, Duke Energy completed the exit of the former DENA operations outside the Midwest region and recognized additional losses as a result of sales of certain contracts. Additionally, during 2006 Duke Energy exited the Cinergy commercial marketing and trading business. 2007 Objectives. As a result of the initiatives accomplished during 2006 and the spin off of the natural gas businesses on January 2, 2007, Duke Energy is positioned as a lower risk business with steady earnings growth potential. For 2007, management of Duke Energy is focused on the following objectives, as outlined in the 2007 Charter: Establish the identity and culture of the new Duke Energy, unifying its people, values, strategy, processes and systems; Optimize its operations by focusing on safety, simplicity, accountability, inclusion, customer satisfaction, cost management and employee development; 42 Table of Contents PART II Achieve public policy, regulatory and legislative outcomes that balance customers needs for reliable energy at competitive prices with shareholders expectation of superior returns; Invest in energy infrastructure that meets rising customer demands for reliable energy in an energy efficient and environmentally sound manner; and Achieve 2007 financial objectives and position Duke Energy to meet future growth targets. Duke Energys consolidated earnings during 2007 are anticipated to be reduced principally as a result of the spin off of the natural gas businesses on January 2, 2007. Excluding the impacts of the spin off of the natural gas businesses, earnings are anticipated to be favorably affected by the following factors: a full year of earnings from the Midwest operations acquired from Cinergy, realization of cost savings as the regulatory rate reductions shared with ratepayers will phase out in 2007, customer sales growth, capital reinvestments and regulatory initiatives. The majority of expected earnings in 2007 are anticipated to be contributed from U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, which consists of Duke Energys regulated businesses operating a net capacity of approximately 28,000 megawatts of generation. The regulated generation portfolio consists of a mix of coal, nuclear, natural gas and hydroelectric generation, with substantially all of the sales of electricity coming from coal and nuclear generation facilities. Commercial Power has net capacity of approximately 8,100 megawatts of unregulated generation, of which approximately 4,100 megawatts serves retail customers under the Rate Stabilization Plan in Ohio. Approximately 75% of International Energys net capacity of approximately 4,000 megawatts of installed generation capacity in Latin America consists of baseload hydroelectric capacity that carries a low level of dispatch risk; in addition, for 2007 over 90% of International Energys contractible capacity in Latin America is either currently contracted or receives a system capacity payment. Duke Energys total dividends and dividends per share in 2007 will be lower than in 2006 as a result of the spin off of the natural gas businesses on January 2, 2007. Future dividends are expected to grow in connection with any earnings growth. During the three year period from 2007 to 2009, Duke Energy anticipates annual capital expenditures of approximately $3.5 billion, for a total of approximately $10 billion. These expenditures are principally related to expansion plans, environmental spending related to Clean Air requirements, nuclear fuel, as well as maintenance costs. Current estimates are that Duke Energys regulated generation capacity will need to increase by approximately 6,400 megawatts over the next ten years, with the majority being in North and South Carolina and the remainder being in Indiana. Duke Energy is committed to adding base load capacity at a reasonable price while modernizing the current generation facilities by replacing older, less efficient plants with cleaner, more efficient plants. Significant expansion projects may include a new IGCC plant in Indiana, a new coal unit (or units) at Duke Energys existing Cliffside facility in North Carolina, new gas fired generation units and costs related to the evaluation of the potential construction of a new nuclear power plant in Cherokee County, South Carolina as well as normal additions due to system growth. Costs related to environmental spending are expected to decrease over the three year period as the upgrades to comply with the new environmental regulations are completed. Duke Energy does not anticipate any additional capital investment related to its investment in the Crescent JV. Duke Energy does not currently anticipate funding 2007 capital expenditures with the issuance of common equity, but rather through the use of available cash and cash equivalents as well as the issuance of incremental debt. As the majority of Duke Energys anticipated future capital expenditures are related to its regulated operations, a significant risk to Duke Energy is the ability to recover in a timely manner costs related to such expansion. In Indiana, Duke Energy has been given approval to recover its development costs for the new IGCC plant. In North and South Carolina, Duke Energy will pursue legislation to provide for construction work in progress recovery for the additional unit (or units) at the Cliffside facility as well as the proposed nuclear power plant. Additionally, Duke Energy is attempting to obtain assurance of recovery of development costs related to the proposed nuclear power plant. Duke Energy does not anticipate beginning construction of the proposed nuclear power plant without adequate assurance of cost recovery from the state legislators or regulators. In November 2006, Duke Energy received approval for nearly $260 million of future federal tax credits related to costs to be incurred for the modernization of the Cliffside facility as well as the IGCC plant in Indiana. In an effort to respond to concerns over climate change, the U.S. Congress recently discussed various proposals to reduce or cap carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Any legislation enacted as a result of these efforts could involve a market based cap and trade program. Duke Energy is also focusing on energy efficiency initiatives in an effort to reduce emissions. Duke Energys current regulatory initiatives primarily include obtaining the timely recovery of invested capital and pursuing a regulatory extension of the Rate Stabilization Plan in Ohio through 2010 as well as being a proponent of cost effective energy efficiency initiatives. In North Carolina, Duke Energy is required by June 1, 2007 to file a rate case or show that a price adjustment is not required. During 2006, Duke Energy filed for an increase in its base electric rates in Kentucky. In December 2006, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved an annual rate increase of $49 million to be effective January 1, 2007. 43 Table of Contents PART II New energy legislation has been introduced in the current South Carolina legislative session which includes expansion of the annual fuel clause mechanism to include recovery of costs of reagents (ammonia, limestone, etc.) that are consumed in the operation of Duke Energy Carolinas SO2 and NOx control technologies. The legislation also includes provisions to provide cost recovery assurance for upfront development costs associated with nuclear baseload generation, cost recovery assurance for construction costs associated with nuclear or coal baseload generation, and the ability to recover financing costs for new nuclear or coal baseload generation through annual riders. Similar legislation is being discussed in North Carolina and may be introduced in the 2007 legislative session. In summary, Duke Energy is coordinating its future capital expenditure requirements with regulatory initiatives in order to ensure adequate and timely cost recovery while continuing to provide low cost energy to its customers. Economic Factors for Duke Energys Business. Duke Energys business model provides diversification between stable, less cyclical businesses like U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, and the traditionally higher growth and more cyclical energy businesses like Commercial Power and International Energy. Additionally, Crescents portfolio strategy is diversified between residential, commercial and multi family development. All of Duke Energys businesses can be negatively affected by sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy, including low market prices of commodities, all of which are beyond Duke Energys control, and could impair Duke Energys ability to meet its goals for 2007 and beyond. Declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns would reduce overall electricity sales and lessen Duke Energys cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, thus, consumption of electricity. A portion of U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas business risk is mitigated by its regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of fuel costs under fuel adjustment clauses. If negative market conditions should persist over time and estimated cash flows over the lives of Duke Energys individual assets do not exceed the carrying value of those individual assets, asset impairments may occur in the future under existing accounting rules and diminish results of operations. A change in managements intent about the use of individual assets (held for use versus held for sale) or a change in fair value of assets held for sale could also result in impairments or losses. Duke Energys 2007 goals can also be substantially at risk due to the regulation of its businesses. Duke Energys businesses in the United States are subject to regulations on the federal and state level. Regulations, applicable to the electric power industry, have a significant impact on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate. Changes to regulations are ongoing and Duke Energy cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that any future changes will have on its business. Duke Energys earnings are impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices. Exposure to commodity prices generates higher earnings volatility in the unregulated businesses as there are timing differences as to when such costs are recovered in rates. To mitigate these risks, Duke Energy enters into derivative instruments to effectively hedge known exposures. With the 2006 sales of former DENAs assets outside the Midwestern United States, including substantially all the derivative portfolio, and Cinergys marketing and trading operation, Duke Energy expects a less volatile earnings pattern going forward. Additionally, Duke Energys investments and projects located outside of the United States expose Duke Energy to risks related to laws of other countries, taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of foreign governments. Changes in these factors are difficult to predict and may impact Duke Energys future results. Duke Energy also relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not met by cash flow from operations. An inability to access capital at competitive rates could adversely affect Duke Energys ability to implement its strategy. Market disruptions or a downgrade of Duke Energys credit rating may increase its cost of borrowing or adversely affect its ability to access one or more sources of liquidity. For further information related to managements assessment of Duke Energys risk factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Operating Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2006 as Compared to December 31, 2005. Consolidated operating revenues for 2006 decreased $1,113 million, compared to 2005. This change was driven by: A $5,530 million decrease due to the deconsolidation of DEFS, effective July 1, 2005, and A $274 million decrease at Crescent due primarily to the deconsolidation of Crescent, effective September 7, 2006 and softening in the residential real estate market. 44 Table of Contents PART II Partially offsetting these decreases in revenues were: An approximate $3,891 million increase due to the merger with Cinergy A $468 million increase at Natural Gas Transmission due primarily to Canadian assets (approximately $281 million), primarily higher processing revenues on the Empress System, favorable Canadian dollar foreign exchange impacts (approximately $157 million), and recovery of higher natural gas commodity costs (approximately $146 million), resulting from higher natural gas prices passed through to customers without a mark up at Union Gas, partially offset by lower gas usage due to unseasonably warmer weather (approximately $186 million) A $216 million increase at International Energy due primarily to higher revenues in Peru from increased ownership and resulting consolidation of Aguaytia (approximately $118 million), higher energy prices in El Salvador (approximately $40 million), favorable results in Brazil, primarily foreign exchange rate impacts (approximately $31 million) and higher electricity volumes and prices in Argentina (approximately $27 million), and An approximate $130 million increase in Other related to the prior year impact of mark to market losses, primarily unrealized, due to increased commodity prices as a result of the discontinuance of certain cash flow hedges entered into to hedge Field Services commodity price risk (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Risk Management and Hedging Activities, Credit Risk, and Financial Instruments) from February 22, 2005 to June 30, 2005. Effective with the deconsolidation of DEFS on July 1, 2005, mark to market changes related to these discontinued hedges are classified in Other income and expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Year Ended December 31, 2005 as Compared to December 31, 2004. Consolidated operating revenues for 2005 decreased $3,299 million, compared to 2004. This change was driven by: A $5,380 million decrease due to the deconsolidation of DEFS, effective July 1, 2005, and An approximate $130 million decrease resulting from mark to market losses, primarily unrealized, due to increased commodity prices as a result of the discontinuance of certain cash flow hedges entered into to hedge Field Services commodity price risk discussed above. Partially offsetting these decreases in revenues were: An approximate $850 million increase at Field Services, excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of DEFS, due primarily to higher average commodity prices, primarily NGL and natural gas in the first six months of 2005 A $704 million increase at Natural Gas Transmission due primarily to new Canadian assets (approximately $269 million), primarily the Empress System, favorable foreign exchange rates (approximately $153 million) as a result of the strengthening Canadian dollar (partially offset by currency impacts to expenses), higher natural gas prices that are passed through to customers (approximately $152 million), an increase related to U.S. business operations (approximately $60 million) driven by higher rates and contracted volumes and increased gas distribution revenues (approximately $36 million), resulting from higher gas usage in the power market A $363 million increase at U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas due primarily to increased sales to retail and wholesale customers as a result of warmer weather, more efficient performance of the generation fleet, and customer growth, coupled with an increase in fuel rates primarily as a result of higher coal costs in 2005 and increased market prices for wholesale power A $126 million increase at International Energy due primarily to favorable foreign exchange rate changes in Brazil, and higher energy prices and volumes, and A $58 million increase at Crescent due primarily to higher residential developed lot sales. For a more detailed discussion of operating revenues, see the segment discussions that follow. Consolidated Operating Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2006 as Compared to December 31, 2005. Consolidated operating expenses for 2006 decreased $923 million, compared to 2005. The change was primarily driven by: An approximate $5,090 million decrease due to the deconsolidation of DEFS, effective July 1, 2005 A $239 million decrease at Crescent due primarily to the deconsolidation of Crescent, effective September 7, 2006 and softening in the residential real estate market, and 45 Table of Contents PART II An approximate $120 million decrease associated with the prior year recognition of unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) as a result of the discontinuance of certain cash flow hedges entered into to hedge Field Services commodity price risk, which were previously accounted for as cash flow hedges (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Risk Management and Hedging Activities, Credit Risk, and Financial Instruments). Partially offsetting these decreases in expenses were: An approximate $3,430 million increase due to the merger with Cinergy A $447 million increase at Natural Gas Transmission due primarily to Canadian assets (approximately $189 million), primarily the Empress System, increased natural gas prices at Union Gas (approximately $146 million), resulting from high natural gas prices passed through to customers without a mark up at Union Gas, higher operating and maintenance, including pipeline integrity and project development expenses (approximately $133 million), Canadian dollar foreign exchange impacts (approximately $124 million), partially offset by lower gas purchase costs at Union Gas resulting primarily from unseasonably warmer weather (approximately $157 million) A $341 million increase at International Energy due primarily to higher costs in Peru (approximately $109 million), driven primarily by increased ownership and resulting consolidation of Aguaytia, a reserve related to a settlement made in conjunction with the Citrus litigation (approximately $100 million), higher fuel prices and increased consumption in El Salvador (approximately $38 million), unfavorable exchange rates, increased regulatory fees and higher purchased power costs in Brazil (approximately $34 million), an increase in Mexico due to an impairment of a note receivable from Campeche (approximately $33 million), and impairments in Bolivia (approximately $28 million) An $179 million increase in Other due primarily to costs to achieve the Cinergy merger and the anticipated spin off of Duke Energys natural gas businesses (approximately $128 million and $58 million, respectively), a reserve charge related to contract settlement negotiations (approximately $65 million), partially offset by decreases due to the continued wind down of the former DENA businesses (approximately $47 million), and An approximate $115 million increase at Duke Energy Carolinas driven primarily by increased fuel expenses, due primarily to higher coal costs ($188 million) and increased purchase power expense resulting primarily from less generation availability during 2006 as a result of outages at base load stations ($42 million), partially offset by lower regulatory amortization, due primarily to reduced amortization of compliance costs related to clean air legislation ($86 million), and decreased operating and maintenance expense, due primarily to a December 2005 ice storm. Year Ended December 31, 2005 as Compared to December 31, 2004. Consolidated operating expenses for 2005 decreased $3,025 million, compared to 2004. The change was primarily driven by: A $5,072 million decrease due to the deconsolidation of DEFS, effective July 1, 2005, and An approximate $100 million decrease in operating expenses at Commercial Power, mainly resulting from the sale of the Southeast Plants. Partially offsetting these decreases in expenses were: An approximate $675 million increase in operating expenses at Field Services driven primarily by higher average NGL and natural gas prices in the first six months of 2005 A $640 million increase at Natural Gas Transmission due primarily to new Canadian assets (approximately $272 million), primarily gas purchase costs associated with the Empress System, increased natural gas prices at Union Gas (approximately $152 million, which is offset in revenues), foreign exchange impacts (approximately $118 million) as discussed above (offset by currency impacts to revenues), and increased gas purchases for distribution (approximately $43 million) primarily due to higher gas usage in the power market A $346 million increase in operating expenses at U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas due primarily to increased fuel expenses, driven by higher coal costs and increased generation to meet customer demand, and increased operating and maintenance expenses due primarily to increased planned outage and maintenance at generating plants, planned maintenance to improve reliability of distribution and transmission equipment, and higher storm charges in 2005, driven primarily by an ice storm in December 2005 An approximate $120 million increase related to the recognition of unrealized losses in AOCI as a result of the discontinuance of certain cash flow hedges entered into to hedge Field Services commodity price risk, which were previously accounted for as cash flow hedges (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Risk Management and Hedging Activities, Credit Risk, and Financial Instruments) 46 Table of Contents PART II An approximate $75 million charge to increase liabilities associated with mutual insurance companies in 2005 A $74 million increase at International Energy due primarily to higher fuel prices, increased fuel volumes purchased, higher maintenance costs and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes in Brazil, offset by decreased power purchase obligations in Brazil, and A $64 million increase as a result of the 2004 correction of an immaterial accounting error in prior periods related to reserves at Bison. For a more detailed discussion of operating expenses, see the segment discussions that follow. Consolidated Gains on Sales of Investments in Commercial and Multi Family Real Estate Consolidated gains on sales of investments in commercial and multi family real estate were $201 million in 2006, $191 million in 2005, and $192 million in 2004. The gain in 2006 was driven primarily by pre tax gains from the sale of two office buildings at Potomac Yard in Washington, D.C. and a gain on a land sale at Lake Keowee in northwestern South Carolina. The gain in 2005 was driven primarily by pre tax gains from the sales of surplus legacy land, particularly a large sale in Lancaster, South Carolina, commercial land sales, including a large sale near Washington, D.C. and multi family project sales in North Carolina and Florida. The gain in 2004 was driven primarily by pre tax gains from commercial land and project sales in the Washington D.C. area and pre tax gains from the sales of surplus legacy land. Consolidated Gains (Losses) on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net Consolidated gains (losses) on sales of other assets and other, net was a gain of $276 million for 2006, a gain of $534 million for 2005, and a loss of $416 million for 2004. The gain in 2006 was due primarily to the pre tax gains resulting from the sale of an effective 50% interest in Crescent, creating a joint venture between Duke Energy and MSREF (approximately $250 million), and gains on settlements of customers transportation contracts at Natural Gas Transmission (approximately $28 million), partially offset by Commercial Powers losses on sales of emission allowances (approximately $29 million). The gain in 2005 was due primarily to the pre tax gain resulting from the DEFS disposition transaction (approximately $575 million), partially offset by net pre tax losses at Commercial Power, principally the termination of DENA structured power contracts in the Southeast region (approximately $75 million). The loss in 2004 was due primarily to pre tax losses on the sale of the Southeast Plants (approximately $360 million) at Commercial Power, and the termination and sale of DETM contracts ($65 million) in Other. Consolidated Operating Income Year Ended December 31, 2006 as Compared to December 31, 2005. For 2006, consolidated operating income decreased $438 million, compared to 2005. Decreased operating income was primarily related to an approximate $575 million gain in 2005 resulting from the DEFS disposition transaction, the impacts of the deconsolidation of DEFS, effective July 1, 2005, which amounted to approximately $440 million for 2005, an approximate $190 million of cost in 2006 to achieve the Cinergy merger and the anticipated spin off of Duke Energys natural gas businesses, and approximately $165 million of charges in 2006 related to settlements and contract negotiations. Partially offsetting these decreases were an approximately $461 million of operating income generated by legacy Cinergy in 2006 as a result of the merger, an approximate $250 million gain in 2006 on the sale of an effective 50% interest in Crescent and an approximate $250 million negative impact to operating income in 2005 related to the discontinuance of certain cash flow hedges entered into to hedge Field Services commodity price risk. Year Ended December 31, 2005 as Compared to December 31, 2004. For 2005, consolidated operating income increased $675 million, compared to 2004. Increased operating income was due primarily to the gain in 2005 resulting from the DEFS disposition transaction and the charge in 2004 associated with the sale of the Southeast Plants in 2005, partially offset by charges in 2005 related to the discontinuance of certain cash flow hedges entered into to hedge Field Services commodity price risk, charges in 2005 related to the termination of structured power contracts in the Southeast region and increased liabilities associated with mutual insurance companies. Other drivers to operating income are discussed above. For more detailed discussions, see the segment discussions that follow. Consolidated Other Income and Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2006 as Compared to December 31, 2005. For 2006, consolidated other income and expenses decreased $801 million, compared to 2005. The decrease was due primarily to the $1,245 million pre tax gains on sales of equity investments recorded in 2005, primarily associated with the sale of TEPPCO GP and Duke Energys limited partner interest in TEPPCO LP, partially offset by an increase of approximately $253 million in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates due primarily to the deconsolidation of DEFS starting July 1, 2005 and an increase of approximately $115 million of interest income resulting primarily from favorable income tax settlements in 2006. 47 Table of Contents PART II Year Ended December 31, 2005 as Compared to December 31, 2004. For 2005, consolidated other income and expenses increased $1,505 million, compared to 2004. The increase was due primarily to the $1,245 million pre tax gains associated with the sale of TEPPCO GP and Duke Energys limited partner interest in TEPPCO LP, equity income of $292 million for the investment in DEFS subsequent to the deconsolidation of DEFS, effective July 1, 2005, slightly offset by the realized and unrealized pre tax losses recognized in 2005 on certain derivative contracts hedging Field Services commodity price risk which were discontinued as cash flow hedges as a result of the deconsolidation of DEFS by Duke Energy. Effective with the deconsolidation of DEFS on July 1, 2005, mark to market changes related to the Field Services discontinued hedges are classified in Other income and expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, while from February 22, 2005 to June 30, 2005 these mark to market changes were classified in Non regulated electric, natural gas, natural gas liquids and other revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Consolidated Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, 2006 as Compared to December 31, 2005. For 2006, consolidated interest expense increased $187 million, compared to 2005. This increase is primarily attributable to the increase in long term debt as a result of the merger with Cinergy (an approximate $228 million impact), partially offset by reduced interest expense associated with DEFS, which was deconsolidated on July 1, 2005 (an approximate $82 million impact). Year Ended December 31, 2005 as Compared to December 31, 2004. For 2005, consolidated interest expense decreased $216 million, compared to 2004. This decrease was due primarily to Duke Energys debt reduction efforts in 2004 (an approximate $140 million impact) and the deconsolidation of DEFS effective July 1, 2005 (an approximate $80 million impact). Consolidated Minority Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, 2006 as Compared to December 31, 2005. For 2006, consolidated minority interest expense decreased $477 million, compared to 2005. This decrease primarily resulted from the 2005 gain associated with the sale of TEPPCO GP and the impact of deconsolidation of DEFS effective July 1, 2005. Year Ended December 31, 2005 as Compared to December 31, 2004. For 2005, consolidated minority interest expense increased $338 million, compared to 2004. This increase was driven primarily by increased earnings at DEFS in the first six months of 2005 as a result of the sale of TEPPCO GP and higher commodity prices, offset by the impact of the deconsolidation of DEFS effective July 1, 2005. Consolidated Income Tax Expense from Continuing Operations Year Ended December 31, 2006 as Compared to December 31, 2005. For 2006, consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations decreased $439 million, compared to 2005. This decrease primarily resulted from lower pre tax earnings, due primarily to the 2005 gains associated with the sale of TEPPCO GP and Duke Energys limited partner interest in TEPPCO LP as discussed above, offset by the 2006 gain on Crescent. The effective tax rate decreased in 2006 (29%) compared to 2005 (34%). The lower effective tax rate for year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005 was primarily due to favorable tax settlements on research and development costs and nuclear decommissioning costs, tax benefits related to the impairment of an investment in Bolivia, and reserves and tax credits recognized on synthetic fuel operations. Year Ended December 31, 2005 as Compared to December 31, 2004. For 2005, consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations increased $775 million, compared to 2004. The increase in income tax expense from continuing operations is primarily a result of $2,058 million in higher pre tax earnings, due primarily to the gains associated with the sale of TEPPCO GP, Duke Energys limited partner interest in TEPPCO LP and the DEFS disposition transaction (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions and Dispositions). Other than the increase from higher pre tax earnings, the increase in income tax expense from continuing operations is due to an increase in the effective tax rate, which was approximately 34% in 2005, as compared to approximately 29% in 2004. The increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the release of approximately $52 million of income tax reserves, resulting from the resolution of various outstanding income tax issues and changes in estimates in 2004 and a $20 million tax benefit in 2004 recognized in connection with the prior year formation of Duke Energy Americas, LLC, partially offset by the $45 million taxes recorded in 2004 on the repatriation of foreign earnings that was expected to occur in 2005 associated with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Consolidated (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax Consolidated (loss) income from discontinued operations was ($156) million for 2006, ($701) million for 2005, and $244 million for 2004. These amounts represent results of operations and gains (losses) on dispositions related primarily to former DENAs assets and 48 Table of Contents PART II contracts outside the Midwestern and Southeastern United States, which are included in Other, and Cinergy commercial marketing and trading operations, which are included in Commercial Power, (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale). The 2006 amount is primarily comprised of approximately $140 million of after tax losses associated with certain contract terminations or sales at former DENA, as a result of the 2005 decision to exit substantially all of former DENAs remaining assets and contracts outside the Midwestern United States and certain contractual positions related to the Midwestern assets, and the recognition of approximately $17 million of after tax losses associated with exiting the Cinergy commercial marketing and trading operations. The 2005 amount is primarily comprised of an approximate $550 million non cash, after tax charge (approximately $900 million pre tax) for the impairment of assets, and the discontinuance of hedge accounting and the discontinuance of the normal purchase/normal sale exception for certain positions, as a result of the decision to exit substantially all of former DENAs remaining assets and contracts outside the Midwestern United States and certain contractual positions related to the Midwestern assets. Additionally, during 2005, Duke Energy recognized after tax losses of approximately $250 million (approximately $400 million pre tax) as the result of selling certain gas transportation and structured contracts related to the former DENA operations. These charges were offset by the recognition of after tax gains of approximately $125 million (approximately $200 million pre tax) related to the recognition of deferred gains in AOCI related to discontinued cash flow hedges related to the former DENA operations. The 2004 amount is primarily comprised of a $273 million after tax gain resulting from the sale of International Energys Asia Pacific Business, and an approximate $117 million after tax gain on the sale of two partially constructed merchant power plants in the western United States offset by operating losses at the western and northeast merchant power plants. Consolidated Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle, net of tax and minority interest During 2005, Duke Energy recorded a net of tax and minority interest cumulative effect adjustment for a change in accounting principle of $4 million as a reduction in earnings. The change in accounting principle related to the implementation of FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, in which the timing or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of Duke Energy. Segment Results Management evaluates segment performance based on earnings before interest and taxes from continuing operations, after deducting minority interest expense related to those profits (EBIT). On a segment basis, EBIT excludes discontinued operations, represents all profits from continuing operations (both operating and non operating) before deducting interest and taxes, and is net of the minority interest expense related to those profits. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments are managed centrally by Duke Energy, so the gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurement, and interest and dividend income on those balances, are excluded from the segments EBIT. Management considers segment EBIT to be a good indicator of each segments operating performance from its continuing operations, as it represents the results of Duke Energys ownership interest in operations without regard to financing methods or capital structures. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Business Segments, for a discussion of Duke Energys new segment structure. As discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale during the third quarter of 2005, the Board of Directors of Duke Energy authorized and directed management to execute the sale or disposition of substantially all former DENAs remaining assets and contracts outside the Midwestern United States and certain contractual positions related to the Midwestern assets. As a result of this exit plan, the continuing operations of the former DENA segment (which primarily include the operations of the Midwestern generation assets, former DENAs remaining Southeastern operations related to assets which were disposed of in 2004, the remaining operations of DETM, and certain general and administrative costs) have been reclassified to Commercial Power, except for DETM, which is in Other. Previously, the continuing operations of the former DENA segment were included as a component of Other in 2005 and as a component of the former DENA segment in prior periods. 49 Table of Contents PART II Duke Energys segment EBIT may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate EBIT in the same manner. Segment EBIT is summarized in the following table, and detailed discussions follow.

Year Ended December 31, 2006 as Compared to December 31, 2005 Operating Revenues. The increase was driven primarily by: A $2,651 million increase in regulated revenues due to the acquisition of Cinergy A $203 million increase in fuel revenues driven by increased fuel rates for retail customers due primarily to increased coal costs. The delivered cost of coal in 2006 is approximately $11 per ton higher than the same period in 2005, representing an approximately 20% increase, and A $27 million increase related to demand from retail customers, due primarily to continued growth in the number of residential and general service customers in Duke Energy Carolinas service territory. The number of customers in 2006 increased by approximately 45,000 compared to 2005. Partially offsetting these increases were: A $91 million decrease in wholesale power sales, net of the impact of sharing of profits from wholesale power sales with industrial customers in North Carolina ($40 million). Sales volumes decreased by approximately 39% primarily due to production constraints caused by generation outages and pricing A $77 million decrease related to the sharing of anticipated merger savings by way of a rate decrement rider with regulated customers in North Carolina and South Carolina. As a requirement of the merger, Duke Energy Carolinas is required to share anticipated merger savings of approximately $118 million with North Carolina customers and approximately $40 million with South Carolina customers over a one year period, and A $32 million decrease in GWh sales to retail customers due to unfavorable weather conditions compared to the same period in 2005. Weather statistics in 2006 for heating degree days were approximately 9% below normal as compared to 2% above normal in 2005. Overall weather statistics for both heating and cooling periods in 2006 were unfavorable compared to the same periods in 2005. Operating Expenses. The increase was driven primarily by: A $2,245 million increase in regulated operating expenses due to the acquisition of Cinergy A $188 million increase in fuel expenses, due primarily to higher coal costs. Fossil generation fueled by coal accounted for slightly more than 50% of total generation for year to date December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the delivered cost of coal in 2006 is approximately $11 per ton higher than the same period in 2005 A $42 million increase in purchased power expense, due primarily to less generation availability during 2006 as a result of outages at base load stations, and A $24 million increase in depreciation expense, due to additional capital spending. Partially offsetting these increases were: An $86 million decrease in regulatory amortization, due to reduced amortization of compliance costs related to clean air legislation during 2006 as compared to the same period in 2005. Regulatory amortization expenses were approximately $225 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to approximately $311 million during the same period in 2005 A $39 million decrease in operating and maintenance expenses, due primarily to a December 2005 ice storm, and A $15 million decrease in donations related to sharing of profits from wholesale power sales with charitable, educational and economic development programs in North Carolina and South Carolina. For the year ended December 31, 2006, donations totaled $13 million, while for the same period in 2005, donations totaled $28 million. 51 Table of Contents PART II Other income and expenses. The increase in Other income and expenses resulted primarily from an increase in allowance for funds used during construction due mainly to the acquisition of the regulated operations of Cinergy. EBIT. The increase in EBIT resulted primarily from the acquisition of the regulated operations of Cinergy, lower regulatory amortization in North Carolina, increased demand from retail customers due to continued growth in the number of residential and general service customers and decreased operating and maintenance expense in the Carolinas. These changes were partially offset by lower wholesale power sales, net of sharing, rate reductions due to the merger, unfavorable weather conditions and increased purchased power expense in the Carolinas. Matters Impacting Future U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas Results U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas continues to increase its customer base, maintain low costs and deliver high quality customer service in the Carolinas and Midwest. The residential and general service sectors are expected to grow. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas will continue to provide strong cash flows from operations to Duke Energy. Changes in weather, wholesale power market prices, service area economy, generation availability and changes to the regulatory environment would impact future financial results for U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas. Rate reductions for merger savings will primarily cease in the second quarter of 2007. In addition, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas results will be affected by its flexibility to vary the amortization expenses associated with the North Carolina clean air legislation. U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas amortization expense related to this clean air legislation totals $863 million from inception, with $311 million recorded in 2005 and $225 million recorded in 2006. At least $185 million of amortization will be recognized in 2007 in order to recognize the minimum cumulative amortization of approximately $1.05 billion required by the end of 2007. Various regulatory activities will continue in 2007, including a North Carolina rate review and filings for certification for new generation and approval of various costs to be recovered in trackers. The outcomes of these matters will impact future earnings and cash flows for U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas. As a result of additional costs and synergies that are expected from the merger with Cinergy as well as the uncertainty related to the regulatory activities mentioned above, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas is unable to estimate reported segment EBIT for 2007 and beyond. However, segment EBIT for 2007 is expected to be higher than in 2006 primarily due to a full year of contributions from Cinergys regulated operations and the expectation for more normalized weather in U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas service territories. Year Ended December 31, 2005 as Compared to December 31, 2004 Operating Revenues. The increase was driven primarily by: A $137 million increase in fuel revenues, due primarily to increased GWh sales to retail and wholesale customers and increased fuel rates for retail customers due primarily to increased coal costs. Sales to retail customers increased by approximately 2%, while sales to wholesale customers increased by approximately 40% resulting in significantly more fuel revenue collections from those customers. The delivered cost of coal in 2005 is approximately $7 per ton higher than in 2004 A $109 million increase in wholesale power revenues, net of the impact of sharing of profits from wholesale power sales with industrial customers in North Carolina ($37 million), due primarily to increased sales volumes and higher market prices, approximately $42 million and $104 million, respectively. Wholesale GWh sales increased by approximately 40% due to strong demand driven by favorable weather, more efficient performance by the generation fleet in 2005 and alleviation of coal constraints that limited wholesale sales opportunities in 2004. Gross margin increased by $11,000 per GWh, an 80% increase, due to higher average market rates for power resulting primarily from energy supply disruptions and record natural gas prices in 2005 A $55 million increase in GWh sales to retail customers due to favorable weather conditions during the latter half of the year. Weather statistics in 2005 for cooling degree days were approximately 7% better than normal as compared to 1% below normal in 2004, and A $27 million increase related to demand from retail customers, due primarily to continued growth in the number of residential and general service customers in Franchised Electrics service territory. The number of customers in 2005 increased by approximately 43,000 compared to 2004. Operating Expenses. The increase was driven primarily by: A $176 million increase in fuel expenses, due primarily to higher coal costs and increased generation to meet the strong demand of retail and wholesale customers. Total generation increased by 4% compared to 2004 and generation fueled by coal accounted for more than 50 percent of total generation during both periods. The delivered cost of coal in 2005 is approximately $7 per ton higher than the same period in 2004 52 Table of Contents PART II A $134 million increase in operating and maintenance expenses, due primarily to increased planned outage and maintenance at generating plants, planned maintenance to improve the reliability of distribution and transmission equipment and employee wages and benefits A $29 million increase due to higher storm charges in 2005. The increase is primarily due to a December 2005 ice storm ($46 million), which resulted in outages for approximately 700,000 customers. This is partially offset by charges for Hurricane Ivan in September 2004 ($11 million) and a wind storm in March 2004 ($7 million), and A $14 million increase in donations related to sharing of profits from wholesale power sales with charitable, educational and economic development programs in North Carolina and South Carolina. For the year ended December 31, 2005, donations totaled $28 million, while for the same period in 2004, donations totaled $14 million. EBIT. The increase in EBIT resulted primarily from increased sales to wholesale customers, net of sharing, increased sales to retail customers due to favorable weather in 2005, and continued growth in the number of residential and general service customers in 2005. These changes were partially offset by increased operating and maintenance expenses, including storm costs. Natural Gas Transmission Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Variance2006 vs2005 2004 Variance2005 vs2004 (in millions, except where noted) Operating revenues $ 4,523 $ 4,055 $ 468 $ 3,351 $ 704 Operating expenses 3,162 2,715 447 2,075 640 Gains (losses) on sales of other assets and other, net 47 13 34 17 (4 ) Operating income 1,408 1,353 55 1,293 60 Other income and expenses, net 69 65 4 63 2 Minority interest expense 39 30 9 27 3 EBIT $ 1,438 $ 1,388 $ 50 $ 1,329 $ 59 Proportional throughput, TBtu(a) 3,248 3,410 (162 ) 3,332 78 (a) Trillion British thermal units. Revenues are not significantly impacted by pipeline throughput fluctuations since revenues are primarily composed of demand charges. Year Ended December 31, 2006 as Compared to December 31, 2005 Operating Revenues. The increase was driven primarily by: A $281 million increase due to Canadian assets purchased in August 2005, primarily higher processing revenues on the Empress System as a result of commodity prices A $157 million increase due to foreign exchange rates favorably impacting revenues from the Canadian operations as a result of the strengthening Canadian dollar (partially offset by currency impacts to expenses), A $146 million increase from recovery of higher natural gas commodity costs, resulting from higher natural gas prices passed through to customers without a mark up at Union Gas. This revenue increase is offset in expenses A $27 million increase in U.S. business operations driven by increased processing revenues associated with transportation, and A $26 million increase from completed and operational pipeline expansion projects in the U.S. Partially offsetting these increases was: A $186 million decrease in gas distribution revenues at Union Gas primarily resulting from lower gas usage due to warmer weather compared to 2005. Operating Expenses. The increase was driven primarily by: A $189 million increase in gas purchase cost associated with the Empress System A $146 million increase related to increased natural gas prices at Union Gas. This amount is offset in revenues. A $133 million increase primarily related to increased operating and maintenance expenses on pipeline and storage operations, including pipeline integrity and project development expenses, higher insurance premiums, and benefit costs, and A $124 million increase caused by foreign exchange impacts (offset by currency impacts to revenues, as discussed above). 53 Table of Contents PART II Partially offsetting these increases were: A $157 million decrease in gas purchase costs at Union Gas, primarily resulting from lower gas usage due to unseasonably warmer weather, and A $15 million decrease related to the resolution in 2006 of prior tax years ad valorem tax issues. Gains (Losses) on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net. The increase was driven primarily by a $28 million gain in 2006 on the settlement of a customers transportation contract, and a $5 million gain on the sale of Stone Mountain assets in 2006. Other Income and Expenses, net. The increase was driven primarily a pre tax SAB No. 51 gain of $15 million related to the Income Funds issuance of additional units of the Canadian income trust fund, partially offset by a construction fee received in 2005 from an affiliate as a result of the successful completion of the Gulfstream Natural Gas System, LLC (Gulfstream), 50% owned by Duke Energy, and Natural Gas Transmissions 50% share of operating and maintenance expenses in 2006 on the Southeast Supply Header project. EBIT. The increase in EBIT is due primarily to the increase in processing earnings (primarily Empress System), the gain on settlement of a customers transportation contract, U.S. business expansion, the gain on the Income Funds issuance of additional units of the Canadian income trust fund, a gain on a property insurance settlement and the strengthening Canadian currency, partially offset by increased operating and maintenance expenses, and lower Union results primarily due to weather. Matters Impacting Future Natural Gas Transmission Results In June 2006, the Board of Directors of Duke Energy authorized management to pursue a plan to create two separate publicly traded companies by spinning off Duke Energys natural gas businesses to Duke Energy shareholders. This transaction was effective January 2, 2007. The new natural gas company, Spectra Energy, principally consists of Duke Energys Natural Gas Transmission business segment and Duke Energys 50 percent ownership interest in DEFS. The historical results of the natural gas businesses are expected to be treated as discontinued operations at Duke Energy in future periods beginning with the first quarter of 2007. As a result of the spin off, Duke Energys future results of operations will not include the operations of Spectra Energy. Year Ended December 31, 2005 as Compared to December 31, 2004 Operating Revenues. The increase was driven primarily by: A $269 million increase due to new Canadian assets, primarily the Empress System A $153 million increase due to foreign exchange rates favorably impacting revenues from the Canadian operations as a result of the strengthening Canadian dollar (partially offset by currency impacts to expenses) A $152 million increase from recovery of higher natural gas commodity costs, resulting from higher natural gas prices that are passed through to customers without a mark up at Union Gas. This revenues increase is offset in expenses A $60 million increase for U.S. business operations driven by higher rates at Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, LLC and Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, LP (collectively, M & N Pipeline) and favorable commodity prices on natural gas processing activities A $36 million increase in gas distribution revenues, primarily due to higher gas usage in the power market, and A $20 million increase from completed and operational pipeline expansion projects in the U.S. Operating Expenses. The increase was driven primarily by: A $272 million increase due to new Canadian assets, primarily gas purchase costs associated with the Empress System A $152 million increase related to increased natural gas prices at Union Gas. This amount is offset in revenues A $118 million increase caused by foreign exchange impacts (offset by currency impacts to revenues, as discussed above) A $43 million increase in gas purchases for distribution, primarily due to higher gas usage in the power market, and A $23 million increase related to the 2004 resolution of ad valorem tax issues in various states. Other Income and Expenses, net. The increase was driven primarily by the successful completion of the Gulfstream Phase II project which went into service in February 2005 and increased volumes at Gulfstream, resulting in a $11 million increase in Gas Transmissions 50% equity earnings and a $5 million construction fee received from an affiliate. These increases were partially offset by a $16 million gain in 2004 on the sale of equity investments, primarily due to the resolution of contingencies related to prior year sales. EBIT. The increase in EBIT was due primarily to earnings from U.S. business expansion projects, improved U.S. operations and favorable foreign exchange rate impacts from the strengthening Canadian currency, partially offset by the 2004 resolution of ad valorem tax issues. 54 Table of Contents PART II Field Services Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Variance2006 vs2005 2004 Variance2005 vs2004 (in millions, except where noted) Operating revenues $ $ 5,530 $ (5,530 ) $ 10,044 $ (4,514 ) Operating expenses 5 5,215 (5,210 ) 9,489 (4,274 ) Gains (losses) on sales of other assets and other, net 577 (577 ) 2 575 Operating income (5 ) 892 (897 ) 557 335 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates(a) 574 292 282 292 Other income and expenses, net 1,259 (1,259 ) 37 1,222 Minority interest expense 497 (497 ) 227 270 EBIT $ 569 $ 1,946 $ (1,377 ) $ 367 $ 1,579 Natural gas gathered and processed/transported, TBtu/d(b) 6.8 6.8 6.8 NGL production, MBbl/d(c) 361 353 8 356 (3 ) Average natural gas price per MMBtu(d) $ 7.23 $ 8.59 $ (1.36 ) $ 6.14 $ 2.45 Average NGL price per gallon(e) $ 0.94 $ 0.85 $ 0.09 $ 0.68 $ 0.17 (a) Includes Duke Energys 50% equity in earnings of DEFS net income subsequent to the deconsolidation of DEFS effective July 1, 2005.

Average price based on NYMEX Henry Hub (e) Does not reflect results of commodity hedges In July 2005, Duke Energy completed the transfer of a 19.7% interest in DEFS to ConocoPhillips, Duke Energys co equity owner in DEFS, which reduced Duke Energys ownership interest in DEFS from 69.7% to 50% (the DEFS disposition transaction) and resulted in Duke Energy and ConocoPhillips becoming equal 50% owners in DEFS. As a result of the DEFS disposition transaction, Duke Energy deconsolidated its investment in DEFS and subsequently has accounted for DEFS as an investment utilizing the equity method of accounting (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions and Dispositions). Year Ended December 31, 2006 as Compared to December 31, 2005 Operating Revenues. The decrease was due to the DEFS disposition transaction and subsequent deconsolidation of DEFS. Operating Expenses. The decrease was due to the DEFS disposition transaction and subsequent deconsolidation of DEFS. Operating expenses for 2005 were also impacted by approximately $120 million of losses recognized due to the reclassification of pre tax unrealized losses in AOCI as a result of the discontinuance of certain cash flow hedges entered into to hedge Field Services commodity price risk, which were previously accounted for as cash flow hedges. Gains (losses) on sales of other assets and other, net. The decrease was due primarily to an approximate pre tax gain of $575 million on the DEFS disposition transaction in the prior year. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates. The increase is due to Duke Energys 50% of equity in earnings of DEFS net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 as compared to equity in earnings of DEFS net income for the six months ended December 31, 2005. DEFS earnings during the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 have continued to be favorably impacted by increased NGL and crude oil prices as compared to the prior period, as well as increased trading and marketing gains due primarily to changes in natural gas prices and the timing of derivative and inventory transactions. Other Income and Expenses, net. The decrease is due to the DEFS disposition transaction and subsequent deconsolidation of DEFS. In 2005, DEFS had a pre tax gain on the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, TEPPCO GP, the general partner of TEPPCO LP of $1.1 billion, and Duke Energy had a pre tax gain on the sale of its limited partner interest in TEPPCO LP of approximately $97 million. TEPPCO GP and Duke Energys limited partner interest in TEPPCO LP were each sold to Enterprise GP Holdings LP, an unrelated third party. Minority Interest Expense. The decrease was due to the DEFS disposition transaction and subsequent deconsolidation of DEFS. Minority interest expense for 2005 was due primarily to the gain on the sale of TEPPCO GP to Enterprise GP Holdings LP for approximately $1.1 billion, as discussed above. 55 Table of Contents PART II EBIT. The decrease in EBIT from 2006 to 2005 resulted primarily from the gain on sale of TEPPCO GP and Duke Energys limited partner interest in TEPPCO LP in 2005 and gain on the DEFS disposition transaction in 2005, which reduced Duke Energys ownership interest in DEFS from 69.7% to 50%. These decreases were partially offset by increased NGL and crude oil prices in 2006 as compared to the prior year. Matters Impacting Future Field Services Results In June 2006, the Board of Directors of Duke Energy authorized management to pursue a plan to create two separate publicly traded companies by spinning off Duke Energys natural gas businesses to Duke Energy shareholders. This transaction was effective January 2, 2007. The new natural gas company, Spectra Energy, principally consists of Duke Energys Natural Gas Transmission business segment, including Union Gas, and Duke Energys 50 percent ownership interest in DEFS. The historical results of the natural gas businesses are expected to be treated as discontinued operations at Duke Energy in future periods beginning with the first quarter of 2007. As a result of the spin off, Duke Energys future results of operations will not include the operations of Spectra Energy. Year Ended December 31, 2005 as Compared to December 31, 2004 Operating Revenues. The decrease was due to the DEFS disposition transaction and subsequent deconsolidation of DEFS. This decrease was partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $850 million during the six months ended June 30, 2005 versus the comparable period in the prior year which was primarily attributable to a $0.14 per gallon increase in average NGL prices and a $0.66 per MMBtu increase in average natural gas prices. Subsequent to June 2005, Duke Energys 50% of equity in earnings related to its investment in DEFS are included in Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates. Operating Expenses. The decrease was due to the DEFS disposition transaction and subsequent deconsolidation of DEFS. Subsequent to June 2005, the results of DEFS are included in Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates. This decrease was partially offset by: Increased operating expense of approximately $675 million during the six months ended June 30, 2005 versus the comparable period in the prior year which was primarily attributable to higher average costs of raw natural gas supply, due primarily to an increase in average NGL and natural gas prices, and An approximate $120 million increase due to the reclassification of pre tax unrealized losses in AOCI during the first quarter 2005 as a result of the discontinuance of certain cash flow hedges entered into to hedge Field Services commodity price risk, which were previously accounted for as cash flow hedges (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Risk Management and Hedging Activities, Credit Risk, and Financial Instruments). After the discontinuance of these hedges, changes in their fair value are being recognized in Other results, as management considers the discontinuance to be an event which disassociates the contracts from the Field Services results. Gains (losses) on sales of other assets and other, net. The increase was primarily due to an approximate pre tax gain of $575 million on the DEFS disposition transaction. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. The increase was driven by the equity in earnings of $292 million for Duke Energys investment in DEFS subsequent to the completion of the DEFS disposition transaction and related deconsolidation. DEFS earnings during the six months ended December 31, 2005 have continued to be favorably impacted by increased commodity prices. These increases were partially offset by higher operating costs and pipeline integrity work as well as lower volumes due in part to hurricane interruptions. Other Income and Expenses, net. The increase was driven primarily by an approximate $1.1 billion pre tax gain in 2005 on the sale of DEFS wholly owned subsidiary, TEPPCO GP, the general partner of TEPPCO LP, and the pre tax gain on the sale of Duke Energys limited partner interest in TEPPCO LP of approximately $100 million. TEPPCO GP and Duke Energys limited partner interest in TEPPCO LP were each sold to Enterprise GP Holdings LP, an unrelated third party. The gain was partially offset by a $33 million decrease in earnings from equity method investments, primarily as a result of the sale of TEPPCO GP and Duke Energys limited partner interest in TEPPCO LP in the first quarter of 2005. Minority Interest Expense. The increase was due primarily to the minority interest impact of the gain on the sale of TEPPCO GP to Enterprise GP Holdings LP for approximately $1.1 billion as well as increased earnings at DEFS during the six months ended June 30, 2005 due to commodity price increases. This increase was partially offset by the DEFS disposition transaction and the related deconsolidation of Duke Energys investment in DEFS effective July 1, 2005. EBIT. The increase was primarily driven by the gain on sale of TEPPCO GP and Duke Energys limited partner interest in TEPPCO LP, the gain as a result of the DEFS disposition transaction and favorable effects of commodity price increases, partially offset by the impact 56 Table of Contents PART II of Duke Energys decreased ownership percentage resulting from the completion of the DEFS disposition transaction. Also, during the first three months of 2005, Duke Energy discontinued certain cash flow hedges entered into to hedge Field Services commodity price risk (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Risk Management and Hedging Activities, Credit Risk, and Financial Instruments). As a result of the discontinuance of these cash flow hedges and hedge accounting treatment, approximately $120 million of pre tax unrealized losses in AOCI related to these contracts have been recognized by Field Services during the year ended December 31, 2005. Field Services future results are subject to volatility for factors such as commodity price changes. Supplemental Data Below is supplemental information for DEFS operating results subsequent to deconsolidation on July 1, 2005: (in millions) Twelve Months EndedDecember 31, 2006 Six Months EndedDecember 31, 2005 Operating revenues $ 12,335 $ 7,463 Operating expenses 11,063 6,814 Operating income 1,272 649 Other income and expenses, net 9 1 Interest expense, net 119 62 Income tax expense 23 4 Net income $ 1,139 $ 584 Commercial Power Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Variance2006 vs2005 2004 Variance2005 vs2004 (in millions, except where noted) Operating revenues $ 1,402 $ 148 $ 1,254 $ 179 $ (31 ) Operating expenses 1,395 200 1,195 302 (102 ) Gains (losses) on sales of other assets and other, net (23 ) (70 ) 47 (359 ) 289 Operating income (16 ) (122 ) 106 (482 ) 360 Other income and expenses, net 37 4 33 3 1 EBIT $ 21 $ (118 ) $ 139 $ (479 ) $ 361 Actual plant production, GWh(a) 17,640 1,759 15,881 3,343 (1,584 ) Net proportional megawatt capacity in operation 8,100 3,600 4,500 3,600 (a) Excludes discontinued operations During the third quarter of 2005, the Board of Directors of Duke Energy authorized and directed management to execute the sale or disposition of substantially all of former DENAs remaining assets and contracts outside the Midwestern United States and certain contractual positions related to the Midwestern assets. As a result of this exit plan, Commercial Power includes the operations of former DENAs Midwestern generation assets and remaining Southeastern operations related to the assets which were disposed of in 2004. The results of former DENAs discontinued operations, which are comprised of assets sold to LS Power, are presented in (Loss) Income From Discontinued Operations, net of tax, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and are discussed in consolidated Results of Operations section titled Consolidated (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax. Year Ended December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005 Operating Revenues. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Cinergy non regulated generation assets for which results, including the impacts of purchase accounting, are reflected from the date of acquisition and thereafter, but are not included in the same period in 2005 (approximately $1,240 million). Operating revenues associated with the former DENA Midwest plants were approximately $14 million higher in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to higher average prices and slightly higher volumes. Operating Expenses. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Cinergy non regulated generation assets for which results, including the impacts of purchase accounting, are reflected from the date of acquisition and thereafter, but are not included in the same period in 2005 (approximately $1,185 million). 57 Table of Contents PART II Gain (losses) on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net. The increase was driven primarily by an approximate $75 million pre tax charge in 2005 related to the termination of structured power contracts in the Southeastern Region and an approximate $6 million gain on the sale of the Pine Mountain synthetic fuel facility in 2006, partially offset by net losses of approximately $29 million on sales of emission allowances in 2006. Other Income and Expenses, net. The increase is driven primarily by equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates related to investments acquired in connection with the Cinergy merger in 2006. EBIT. The increase was due primarily by the approximate $75 million pre tax charge in 2005 related to the termination of structured power contracts in the Southeastern Region and the acquisition of Cinergy assets (approximately $69 million). Matters Impacting Future Commercial Power Results Commercial Powers current strategy is focused on maximizing the returns and cash flows from its current portfolio. Results for Commercial Power are sensitive to changes in power supply, power demand and fuel prices. Segment EBIT for 2007 is expected to be higher than in 2006 primarily due to the impacts of a full year of contributions from Cinergys Midwestern non regulated generation portfolio, impacts of purchase accounting from the Cinergy merger, and the recovery of under collected fuel costs in 2006. Future results for Commercial Power are subject to volatility due to the over or under collection of fuel costs since Commercial Power is not subject to regulatory accounting pursuant to SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In addition, the outcome of the remand hearing by the Ohio Supreme Court in regard to the Rate Stabilization Plan (RSP) with the PUCO could affect the current tariff structure of the RSP. Year Ended December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004 Operating Revenues. The decrease was driven primarily by the sale of the Southeast plants in 2004, including losses in 2005 associated with structured power contracts in the Southeast. Operating Expenses. The decrease was driven primarily by the sale of the Southeast plants in 2004 and lower operating expenses in the Midwest, including: $61 million decrease in operations and maintenance costs, including general and administrative expenses, and depreciation expenses, and $38 million decrease in fuel costs. Gains (losses) on sales of other assets and other, net. The 2005 loss was due primarily to an approximate $75 million pre tax charge related to the termination of structured power contracts in the Southeastern Region. The 2004 results include pre tax losses of approximately $360 million associated with the sale of the Southeast Plants. EBIT. EBIT loss decreased driven by the loss recognized in 2004 on the sale of the Southeast Plants and decreased operating costs and lower general and administrative expense, as outlined above. International Energy Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Variance2006 vs2005 2004 Variance2005 vs2004 (in millions, except where noted) Operating revenues $ 961 $ 745 $ 216 $ 619 $ 126 Operating expenses 877 536 341 462 74 Gains (losses) on sales of other assets and other, net (1 ) (1 ) (3 ) 3 Operating income 83 209 (126 ) 154 55 Other income and expenses, net 76 117 (41 ) 78 39 Minority interest expense 20 12 8 10 2 EBIT $ 139 $ 314 $ (175 ) $ 222 $ 92 Sales, GWh 20,424 18,213 2,211 17,776 437 Net proportional megawatt capacity in operation(a) 3,996 3,937 58 4,139 (202 ) (a) Excludes discontinued operations 58 Table of Contents PART II Year Ended December 31, 2006 as Compared to December 31, 2005 Operating Revenues. The increase was driven primarily by: A $118 million increase in Peru due to increased ownership and resulting consolidation of Aguaytia (See Note 2 in the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions and Dispositions) and an increase in Egenor due to higher sales volumes, offset by lower prices A $40 million increase in El Salvador due to higher energy prices A $31 million increase in Brazil due to the strengthening of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar and higher average energy prices, offset by lower volumes, and A $27 million increase in Argentina primarily due to higher electricity generation, prices and increased gas marketing sales. Operating Expenses. The increase was driven primarily by: A $109 million increase in Peru due to increased ownership and resulting consolidation of Aguaytia (See Note 2 in the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions and Dispositions) and increased purchased power and fuel costs in Egenor A $100 million increase due to a reserve established as a result of a settlement made in conjunction with the Citrus litigation (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies) A $38 million increase in El Salvador primarily due to higher fuel prices and increased fuel consumption A $34 million increase in Brazil due to the strengthening of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar, increased regulatory fees, and purchased power costs A $33 million increase in Mexico due to an impairment of a note receivable from Campeche, and A $28 million increase in Bolivia due primarily to impairment charges as a result of the sale of assets in Bolivia, which was completed in February 2007. Other Income and expenses, net. The decrease was primarily driven by a $26 million decrease in NMC due to lower MTBE margins and unplanned outages and a $12 million decrease as a result of consolidation of Aguaytia in 2006 (See Note 2 in the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions and Dispositions). EBIT. The decrease in EBIT was primarily due to a litigation provision, impairments in Mexico and Bolivia, lower margins at NMC, higher purchased power costs in Egenor, offset by favorable hydrology and pricing in Argentina. Matters Impacting Future International Energy Results International Energys current strategy is focused on selectively growing its Latin American power generation business while continuing to maximize the returns and cash flow from its current portfolio. Results for International Energy are sensitive to changes in hydrology, power supply, power demand and fuel prices. Regulatory matters can also impact International Energy results, as well as impacts from fluctuations in exchange rates, most notably the Brazilian Real. Certain of International Energys long term sales contracts and long term debt in Brazil contain inflation adjustment clauses. While this is favorable to revenue in periods of inflation in the long run, as International Energys contract prices are adjusted, there is an unfavorable impact on interest expense resulting from revaluation of International Energys outstanding local currency debt. In periods of deflation, revenue is negatively impacted and interest expense is positively impacted. International Energys Argentine operations are participating in a government sponsored project to construct and operate additional gas fired generation capacity in Argentina. International Energys future results of operations may be impacted by the Argentine governments ability to successfully carry out this project and provide an adequate return to entities participating in the project. Year Ended December 31, 2005 as Compared to December 31, 2004 Operating Revenues. The increase was driven primarily by: A $32 million increase in Brazil due to favorable exchange rates, higher average energy prices, partially offset by lower sales volumes A $31 million increase in El Salvador due to higher power prices and a favorable change in regulatory price bid methodology A $28 million increase in Argentina due primarily to higher power prices and hydroelectric generation A $14 million increase in Ecuador mainly due to higher volumes resulting from a lack of water for hydro competitors 59 Table of Contents PART II A $12 million increase in Guatemala due to higher power prices, and An $8 million increase in Peru due to favorable hydrological conditions and higher power prices. Operating Expenses. The increase was driven primarily by: A $29 million increase in El Salvador due primarily to higher fuel oil prices, increased fuel oil volumes purchased and increased transmission costs A $26 million increase in Ecuador due to higher maintenance, higher diesel fuel prices, increased diesel fuel volumes purchased and a prior year credit related to long term service contract termination A $15 million increase in Guatemala due to higher fuel prices and increased fuel volumes purchased, in addition to higher operations and maintenance costs A $14 million increase in Brazil due to unfavorable exchange rates and an increase in regulatory and transmission fees, partially offset by lower power purchase obligations, and A $14 million increase in Argentina due to higher power purchase volumes and prices. Partially offsetting these increases were; A $13 million decrease related to a 2004 charge for the disposition of the ownership share in Compania de Nitrogeno de Cantarell, S.A. de C.V. (Cantarell), a nitrogen production and delivery facility in the Bay of Campeche, Gulf of Mexico in 2004, and A $10 million decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily due to lower corporate overhead allocations and compliance costs. Other Income and Expenses, net. The increase was driven primarily by a $55 million increase in equity earnings from the NMC investment driven by higher product margins, offset by a $20 million equity investment impairment related to Campeche in 2005. EBIT. The increase was due primarily to favorable pricing and hydrological conditions in Peru and Argentina, favorable exchange rates in Brazil and higher equity earnings from NMC, absence of a charge associated with the disposition of the ownership share in Cantarell recorded in 2004, partially offset by an equity investment impairment related to Campeche in 2005.

As a result, Crescent segment data includes Crescent as a consolidated entity for periods prior to September 7, 2006 and as an equity investment for the periods subsequent to September 7, 2006. Year Ended December 31, 2006 as Compared to December 31, 2005 Operating Revenues. The decrease was driven primarily by the deconsolidation of Crescent effective September 7, 2006, as well as a $272 million decrease in residential developed lot sales, primarily due to decreased sales at the LandMar division in Florida. Operating Expenses. The decrease was driven primarily the deconsolidation of Crescent effective September 7, 2006, as well as a $187 million decrease in the cost of residential developed lot sales as noted above and a $16 million impairment charge in 2005 related to a residential community in South Carolina (Oldfield). 60 Table of Contents PART II Gains on Sales of Investments in Commercial and Multi Family Real Estate. The increase was driven primarily by an $81 million gain on the sale of two office buildings at Potomac Yard in Washington, D.C. along with a $52 million land sale at Lake Keowee in northwestern South Carolina in 2006, partially offset by a $41 million land sale at Catawba Ridge in South Carolina in 2005, a $15 million gain on a land sale in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2005 and a $19 million gain on a project sale in Jacksonville, Florida in 2005. Gains (Losses) on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net. The increase was due to an approximate $246 million pre tax gain resulting from the sale of an effective 50% interest in Crescent (see Note 2 in the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions and Dispositions). Other Income and Expenses, net. The decrease is primarily due to $45 million in income related to a distribution from an interest in a portfolio of commercial office buildings in the third quarter of 2005. EBIT. The increase was primarily due to the gain on sale of an ownership interest in Crescent, as noted above, as well as the sale of the Potomac Yard office buildings, partially offset by land and project sales in 2005 as discussed above. Matters Impacting Future Crescent Results In September 2006, Duke Energy closed an agreement to create a joint venture of Crescent and sold an effective 50% interest in Crescent to the MS Members. In conjunction with the formation of the Crescent JV, the joint venture, Crescent and Crescents subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement with third party lenders under which Crescent borrowed approximately $1.21 billion, net of transaction costs, of which $1.19 billion was immediately distributed to Duke Energy. Subsequent to the sale, Duke Energy deconsolidated its investment in the Crescent JV and has accounted for the investment under the equity method of accounting. The combination of Duke Energys reduction in ownership and the increased interest expense at Crescent JV as a result of the debt transaction, the impacts of which will be reflected in Duke Energys future equity earnings, will likely significantly impact the amount of equity earnings of the Crescent JV that Duke Energy will recognize in future periods. Since the Crescent JV will capitalize interest as a component of project costs, the impacts of the interest expense on Duke Energys equity earnings will be recognized as projects are sold by the Crescent JV. Year Ended December 31, 2005 as Compared to December 31, 2004 Operating Revenues. The increase was driven primarily by a $64 million increase in residential developed lot sales, due to increased sales at the Palmetto Bluff project in Bluffton, South Carolina and the LandMar affiliate in Northeastern and Central Florida. Operating Expenses. The increase was driven primarily by a $30 million increase in the cost of residential developed lot sales, due to increased developed lot sales at the projects noted above along with an $11 million increase in corporate administrative expense as a result of increased incentive compensation tied to increased operating results. The increases were offset by a $16 million impairment charge in 2005 related to the Oldfield residential project near Beaufort, South Carolina as compared to $50 million in impairment and bad debt charges in 2004 related to the Twin Creeks residential project in Austin, Texas and The Rim project in Payson, Arizona. Gains on Sales of Investments in Commercial and Multi Family Real Estate. The decrease was driven primarily by: A $37 million decrease in real estate land sales primarily due to the $45 million gain on the sale of the Alexandria tract in the Washington, D.C. area in 2004, and A $33 million decrease in commercial project sales primarily due to the $20 million gain on the sale of a commercial project in the Washington, D.C. area in 2004. Partially offsetting these decreases were; A $37 million increase in multi family sales primarily due to the $15 million gain on a land sale in Charlotte, North Carolina and a $19 million gain on a project sale in Jacksonville, Florida in 2005, and A $32 million increase in surplus land sales primarily due to a $42 million gain from a large land sale in Lancaster County, South Carolina in 2005. Other Income and Expenses, net. The increase was primarily due to $45 million in income related to a distribution from an interest in a portfolio of commercial office buildings in the third quarter of 2005. Minority Interest Expense. The increase in minority interest (benefit) expense is primarily due to increased earnings from the LandMar affiliate. EBIT. The increase was primarily due to income related to a distribution from an interest in a portfolio of commercial office buildings, a large land sale in Lancaster County, South Carolina, increased multi family and residential developed lot sales offset by a decrease in commercial land and project sales due primarily to the sale of a commercial project and the Alexandria tract in the Washington, D.C. area in 2004. 61 Table of Contents PART II Supplemental Data Below is supplemental information for Crescent operating results subsequent to deconsolidation on September 7, 2006: September 7through December 31,2006 (in millions) Operating revenues $ 179 Operating expenses $ 152 Operating income $ 27 Net income $ 30 Other Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Variance2006 vs2005 2004 Variance2005 vs2004 (in millions) Operating revenues $ 142 $ 72 $ 70 $ 191 $ (119 ) Operating expenses 735 556 179 388 168 Gains (losses) on sales of other assets and other, net 8 8 (76 ) 84 Operating income (585 ) (476 ) (109 ) (273 ) (203 ) Other income and expenses, net (5 ) (39 ) 34 41 (80 ) Minority interest expense (benefit) (9 ) 3 (12 ) (25 ) 28 EBIT $ (581 ) $ (518 ) $ (63 ) $ (207 ) $ (311 ) Year Ended December 31, 2006 as Compared to December 31, 2005 Operating Revenues. The increase was driven primarily by: An approximate $130 million increase as a result of the prior year impact of realized and unrealized mark to market losses on certain discontinued cash flow hedges originally entered into to hedge Field Services commodity price risk which were accounted for as Operating Revenues prior to the deconsolidation of DEFS, effective July 1, 2005. Partially offsetting this increase was: A $43 million decrease due to the sale of Duke Project Services Group, Inc. (DPSG) in February 2006, and A $21 million decrease due to a prior year mark to market gain related to former DENAs hedge discontinuance in the Southeast. Operating Expenses. The increase was driven primarily by: A $128 million increase due to costs to achieve in 2006 related to the Cinergy merger A $65 million increase due to a charge in 2006 related to contract settlement negotiations A $58 million increase due to costs to achieve in 2006 related to the spin off of Duke Energys natural gas businesses, and A $14 million increase in corporate governance and other costs due primarily to the merger with Cinergy in April 2006. Partially offsetting these increases were: A $47 million decrease due to the continued wind down of the former DENA businesses, and A $45 million decrease due to the sale of DPSG. Other Income and Expenses, net. The increase was driven primarily by an approximate $45 million favorable variance resulting from the realized and unrealized mark to market impacts associated with certain discontinued cash flow hedges originally entered into to hedge Field Services commodity price risk which are recorded in Other income and expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the deconsolidation of DEFS, effective July 1, 2005. EBIT. The decrease was due primarily to the increase in charges in 2006 associated with Cinergy merger and natural gas business spin off costs to achieve, and a charge for contract settlement negotiations. These decreases were partially offset by an increase due to realized and unrealized mark to market impacts of certain discontinued cash flow hedges originally entered into to hedge Field Services commodity price risk. 62 Table of Contents PART II Matters Impacting Future Other Results Future Other results may be subject to volatility as a result of losses insured by Bison and changes in liabilities associated with mutual insurance companies. Costs associated with achieving the spin off of the gas business and the Cinergy merger, and the wind down of DETM could also impact future earnings for Other. Year Ended December 31, 2005 as Compared to December 31, 2004 Operating Revenues. The decrease was driven primarily by: An approximate $130 million decrease as a result of the realized and unrealized mark to market impact of certain discontinued cash flow hedges originally entered into to hedge Field Services commodity price risk (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Risk Management and Hedging Activities, Credit Risk, and Financial Instruments), and An approximate $48 million decrease primarily due to the wind downs of DETM and former DENA businesses. Partially offsetting these decreases was: A $21 million mark to market gain in 2005 related to former DENAs hedge discontinuance in the Southeast. Operating Expenses. The increase was driven primarily by: An approximate $75 million charge to increase liabilities associated with mutual insurance companies in 2005 A $64 million increase as a result of the 2004 correction of an immaterial accounting error in prior periods related to reserves at Bison attributable to property losses at several Duke Energy subsidiaries, and A $26 million increase in corporate governance costs in 2005. Partially offsetting these increases was: A $35 million decrease primarily associated with the continued wind down of DETM. Gains (losses) on sales of other assets and other, net. The 2004 loss was due primarily to approximately $65 million ($39 million net of minority interest expense) of pre tax losses associated with the sale and terminations of DETM contracts. Other Income and Expenses, net. The decrease was driven primarily by an approximate $64 million decrease as a result of the realized and unrealized mark to market impact on discontinued hedges related to Field Services commodity price risk. (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Risk Management and Hedging Activities, Credit Risk, and Financial Instruments.) Minority Interest Expense. The change was due primarily to the continued wind down of DETM. EBIT. The decrease was due primarily to the realized and unrealized mark to market impact of certain discontinued cash flow hedges originally entered into to hedge Field Services commodity price risk, the reversal of insurance reserves at Bison in 2004 and the increase in liabilities associated with mutual insurance companies in 2005. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The application of accounting policies and estimates is an important process that continues to evolve as Duke Energys operations change and accounting guidance evolves. Duke Energy has identified a number of critical accounting policies and estimates that require the use of significant estimates and judgments. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other various assumptions that they believe are reasonable at the time of application. The estimates and judgments may change as time passes and more information about Duke Energys environment becomes available. If estimates and judgments are different than the actual amounts recorded, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to take into consideration the new information. Duke Energy discusses its critical accounting policies and estimates and other significant accounting policies with senior members of management and the audit committee, as appropriate. Duke Energys critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below. Regulatory Accounting Duke Energy accounts for certain of its regulated operations (primarily U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas and Natural Gas Transmission) under the provisions of SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. As a result, Duke Energy records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under GAAP for non regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for 63 Table of Contents PART II costs that either are not likely to or have yet to be incurred. Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes, recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state, provincial and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the asset write offs would be required to be recognized in operating income. Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of regulatory assets. Total regulatory assets were $4,072 million as of December 31, 2006 and $2,319 million as of December 31, 2005. Total regulatory liabilities were $3,058 million as of December 31, 2006 and $2,338 million as of December 31, 2005. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters.) Long Lived Asset Impairments and Assets Held For Sale Duke Energy evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets, excluding goodwill, when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. For long lived assets, impairment would exist when the carrying value exceeds the sum of estimates of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the asset is impaired, the assets carrying value is adjusted to its estimated fair value. When alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration, a probability weighted approach is used for developing estimates of future cash flows. Duke Energy uses the best information available to estimate fair value of its long lived assets and may use more than one source. Judgment is exercised to estimate the future cash flows, the useful lives of long lived assets and to determine managements intent to use the assets. The sum of undiscounted cash flows is primarily dependent on forecasted commodity prices for sales of power or natural gas costs of fuel over periods of time consistent with the useful lives of the assets or changes in the real estate market. Managements intent to use or dispose of assets is subject to re evaluation and can change over time. A change in Duke Energys plans regarding, or probability assessments of, holding or selling an asset could have a significant impact on the estimated future cash flows. Duke Energy considers various factors when determining if impairment tests are warranted, including but not limited to: Significant adverse changes in legal factors or in the business climate; A current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses, or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset; An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset; Significant adverse changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or in its physical condition or a change in business strategy; A significant change in the market value of an asset; and A current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life. Judgment is also involved in determining the timing of meeting the criteria for classification as an asset held for sale under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. (SFAS No. 144) During 2006 and 2005, Duke Energy recorded impairments on several of its long lived assets. (For discussion of these impairments, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Impairments, Severance and Other Charges.) Duke Energy may dispose of certain other assets in addition to the assets classified as held for sale at December 31, 2006. Accordingly, based in part on current market conditions in the merchant energy industry, it is reasonably possible that Duke Energys current estimate of fair value of its long lived assets being considered for sale at December 31, 2006 and its other long lived assets, could change and that change may impact the consolidated results of operations. In addition, Duke Energy could decide to dispose of additional assets in future periods, at prices that could be less than the book value of the assets. Duke Energy uses the criteria in SFAS No. 144 and EITF 03 13, Applying the Conditions in Paragraph 42 of FAS 144 in Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations, to determine whether components of Duke Energy that are being disposed of or are classified as held for sale are required to be reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. To qualify as a discontinued operation under SFAS No. 144, the component being disposed of must have clearly distinguishable operations and cash 64 Table of Contents PART II flows. Additionally, pursuant to EITF 03 13, Duke Energy must not have significant continuing involvement in the operations after the disposal (i.e. Duke Energy must not have the ability to influence the operating or financial policies of the disposed component) and cash flows of the assets sold must have been eliminated from Duke Energys ongoing operations (i.e. Duke Energy does not expect to generate significant direct cash flows from activities involving the disposed component after the disposal transaction is completed). Assuming both preceding conditions are met, the related results of operations for the current and prior periods, including any related impairments and gains or losses on sales, are reflected as (Loss) Income From Discontinued Operations, net of tax, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. If an asset held for sale does not meet the requirements for discontinued operations classification, any impairments and gains or losses on sales are recorded in continuing operations as Gains (Losses) on Sales of Other Assets, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Impairments for all other long lived assets, other than goodwill, are recorded as Impairments and other charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Impairment of Goodwill At December 31, 2006 and 2005, Duke Energy had goodwill balances of $8,175 million and $3,775 million, respectively. Duke Energy evaluates the impairment of goodwill under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). The majority of Duke Energys goodwill at December 31, 2006 relates to the acquisition of Cinergy in April 2006, whose assets are primarily included in the U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas and Commercial Power segments, and the acquisition of Westcoast Energy, Inc. (Westcoast) in March 2002, whose assets are primarily included within the Natural Gas Transmission segment. The remainder relates to International Energys Latin American operations. As of the acquisition date, Duke Energy allocates goodwill to a reporting unit, which Duke Energy defines as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. As required by SFAS No. 142, Duke Energy performs an annual goodwill impairment test and updates the test if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Key assumptions used in the analysis include, but are not limited to, the use of an appropriate discount rate, estimated future cash flows and estimated run rates of operation, maintenance, and general and administrative costs. In estimating cash flows, Duke Energy incorporates expected growth rates, regulatory stability and ability to renew contracts as well as other factors into its revenue and expense forecasts. As a result of the 2006 impairment test required by SFAS No. 142, Duke Energy did not record any impairment on its goodwill. Management continues to remain alert for any indicators that the fair value of a reporting unit could be below book value and will assess goodwill for impairment as appropriate. Revenue Recognition Unbilled and Estimated Revenues. Revenues on sales of electricity, primarily at U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, are recognized when the service is provided. Unbilled revenues are estimated by applying an average revenue/kilowatt hour for all customer classes to the number of estimated kilowatt hours delivered but not billed. Differences between actual and estimated unbilled revenues are immaterial and are a result of customer mix. Revenues on sales of natural gas, natural gas transportation, storage and distribution as well as sales of petroleum products, primarily at Natural Gas Transmission and Field Services (prior to deconsolidation on July 1, 2005), are recognized when either the service is provided or the product is delivered. Revenues related to these services provided or products delivered but not yet billed are estimated each month. These estimates are generally based on contract data, regulatory information, estimated distribution usage based on historical data adjusted for heating degree days, commodity prices and preliminary throughput and allocation measurements. Final bills for the current month are billed and collected in the following month. Differences between actual and estimated unbilled revenues are immaterial. Trading and Marketing Revenues. The recognition of income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for derivative activity is primarily dependent on whether the Accrual Model or MTM Model is applied. While the MTM Model is the default method of accounting for all derivatives, SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, (SFAS No. 133) allows for the use of the Accrual Model for derivatives designated as hedges and certain scope exceptions, including the normal purchase and normal sale exception. Duke Energy designates a derivative as a hedge or a normal purchase or normal sale contract in accordance with internal hedge guidelines and the requirements provided by SFAS No. 133. (For further information regarding the Accrual Model or MTM Model, see Risk Management Accounting below. For further information regarding the presentation of gains and losses or revenue and expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.) 65 Table of Contents PART II Risk Management Accounting Duke Energy uses two comprehensive accounting models for its risk management activities in reporting its consolidated financial position and results of operations: the MTM Model and the Accrual Model. As further discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the MTM Model is applied to trading and undesignated non trading derivative contracts, and the Accrual Model is applied to derivative contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, and normal purchases or sales, as well as to non derivative contracts used for commodity risk management purposes. For the three years ended December 31, 2006, the determination as to which model was appropriate was primarily based on accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the EITF. Under the MTM Model, an asset or liability is recognized at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the change in the fair value of that asset or liability is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the current period. While former DENA was the primary business segment that used this accounting model, the U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, Commercial Power and Field Services segments, as well as Other, have historically had certain transactions subject to this model. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, Duke Energy applied the MTM Model to its derivative contracts, unless subject to hedge accounting or the normal purchase and normal sale exemption (as described below). The MTM Model is applied within the context of an overall valuation framework. All new and existing transactions are valued using approved valuation techniques and market data, and discounted using a risk free based interest rate [i.e. London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or US Treasury Rate]. When available, quoted market prices are used to measure a contracts fair value. However, market quotations for certain energy contracts may not be available for illiquid periods or locations. If no active trading market exists for a commodity or for a contracts duration, holders of these contracts must calculate fair value using internally developed valuation techniques or models. Key components used in these valuation techniques include price curves, volatility, correlation, interest rates and tenor. While volatility and correlation are the most subjective components, the price curve is generally the most significant component affecting the ultimate fair value for a contract subject to the MTM Model. Prices for illiquid periods or locations are established by extrapolating prices for correlated products, locations or periods. These relationships are routinely re evaluated based on available market data, and changes in price relationships are reflected in price curves prospectively. Consideration may also be given to the analysis of market fundamentals when developing illiquid prices. A deviation in any of the components affecting fair value may significantly affect overall fair value. Valuation adjustments for performance and market risk, and administration costs are used to arrive at the fair value of the contract and the gain or loss ultimately recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. While Duke Energy uses common industry practices to develop its valuation techniques, changes in Duke Energys pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition. However, due to the nature and number of variables involved in estimating fair values, and the interrelationships among these variables, sensitivity analysis of the changes in any individual variable is not considered to be relevant or meaningful. Validation of a contracts calculated fair value is performed by an internal group independent of Duke Energys deal origination areas. This group performs pricing model validation, back testing and stress testing of valuation techniques, prices and other variables. Validation of a contracts fair value may be done by comparison to actual market activity and negotiation of collateral requirements with third parties. For certain derivative instruments, Duke Energy applies either hedge accounting or the normal purchase and normal sales exemption in accordance with SFAS No. 133. The use of hedge accounting and the normal purchase and normal sales exemption provide effectively for the use of the Accrual Model. Under this model, there is generally no recognition in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for changes in the fair value of a contract until the service is provided or the associated delivery period occurs (settlement). Hedge accounting treatment may be used when Duke Energy contracts to buy or sell a commodity such as natural gas at a fixed price for future delivery corresponding with anticipated physical sales or purchase of natural gas (cash flow hedge). In addition, hedge accounting treatment may be used when Duke Energy holds firm commitments or asset positions and enters into transactions that hedge the risk that the price of a commodity, such as natural gas or electricity, may change between the contracts inception and the physical delivery date of the commodity (fair value hedge). To the extent that the fair value of the hedge instrument offsets the transaction being hedged, there is no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operations prior to settlement of the hedge. However, as not all of Duke Energys hedges relate to the exact location being hedged, a certain degree of hedge ineffectiveness may be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The normal purchases and normal sales exception, as provided in SFAS No. 133 as amended and interpreted by Derivative Implementation Group Issue C15, Scope Exceptions: Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Exception for Option Type Contracts and Forward Contracts in Electricity, (DIG Issue No. C15) and amended by SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative 66 Table of Contents PART II Instruments and Hedging Activities, (SFAS No. 149) indicates that no recognition of the contracts fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is required until settlement of the contract (in Duke Energys case, the delivery of power). On a limited basis, Duke Energy applies the normal purchase and normal sales exception to certain contracts. To the extent that the hedge is perfectly effective, income statement recognition for the contract will be the same under either model. In addition to derivative contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, and normal purchases or sales, the Accrual Model also encompasses non derivative contracts used for commodity risk management purposes. For these non derivative contracts, there is no recognition in the Consolidated Statements of Operations until the service is provided or delivery occurs. As a result of the September 2005 decision to pursue the sale or other disposition of substantially all of former DENAs remaining assets and contracts outside the Midwestern United States, Duke Energy discontinued hedge accounting for forward natural gas and power contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges and disqualified other forward power contracts previously designated under the normal purchases normal sales exception effective September 2005. For additional information regarding risk management activities, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk include daily earnings at risk information related to commodity derivatives recorded using the MTM Model and an operating income sensitivity analysis related to hypothetical changes in certain commodity prices recorded using the Accrual Model. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits Duke Energy accounts for its defined benefit pension plans using SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, (SFAS No. 87) and SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. Under SFAS No. 87, pension income/expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods. Other post retirement benefits are accounted for using SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, (SFAS No. 106). (See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Employee Benefit Plans.) Funding requirements for defined benefit plans are determined by government regulations, not SFAS No. 87. Duke Energy made voluntary contributions of $124 million in 2006, zero in 2005 and $250 million in 2004 to its U.S. plan. Duke Energy anticipates making a contribution of approximately $150 million to the U.S. plan in 2007. Duke Energy made contributions to the Westcoast DB plans of approximately $44 million in 2006, $42 million in 2005 and $26 million in 2004. As a result of the spin off of the natural gas businesses, Duke Energy has no future obligations to make contributions to the Westcoast DB plans. Duke Energy made contributions to the Westcoast DC plans of approximately $4 million in 2006, $3 million in 2005 and $3 million in 2004. As a result of the spin off of the natural gas businesses, Duke Energy has no future obligations to make contributions to the Westcoast DC plans. The calculation of pension expense, other post retirement expense and Duke Energys pension and other post retirement liabilities require the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and reported liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Duke Energy believes that the most critical assumptions for pension and other post retirement benefits are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. Additionally, medical and prescription drug cost trend rate assumptions are critical for other post retirement benefits. The prescription drug trend rate assumption resulted from the effect of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act (Modernization Act). Duke Energy U.S. Plans Duke Energy and its subsidiaries (including legacy Cinergy businesses) maintain non contributory defined benefit retirement plans (U.S. Plans). The U.S. Plans cover most U.S. employees using a cash balance formula. Under a cash balance formula, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits that are based upon a percentage (which may vary with age and years of service) of current eligible earnings and current interest credits. Certain legacy Cinergy U.S. employees are covered under plans that use a final average earnings formula. Under a final average earnings formula, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to a percentage of their highest 3 year average earnings, plus a percentage of their highest 3 year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of participation (maximum of 35 years), plus a percentage of their highest 3 year average earnings times years of participation in excess of 35 years. Duke Energy also maintains non qualified, non contributory defined benefit retirement plans which cover certain U.S. executives. Duke Energy and most of its subsidiaries also provide some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non contributory basis. Employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement, as defined in the plans. 67 Table of Contents PART II Duke Energys U.S. Plans recognized pre tax pension cost of $80 million, pre tax non qualified pension cost of $11 million and pre tax other post retirement benefits cost of $76 million in 2006. In 2007, Duke Energys U.S. pension cost is expected to be approximately $5 million lower, non qualified pension cost is expected to be $1 million lower and other post retirement benefits cost is expected to be $16 million lower primarily as a result of the spin off of the natural gas businesses. For both pension and other post retirement plans, Duke Energy assumed that its U.S. plans assets would generate a long term rate of return of 8.5% as of September 30, 2006. The assets for Duke Energys U.S. pension and other post retirement plans are maintained by a master trust. The investment objective of the master trust is to achieve reasonable returns on trust assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants. The asset allocation target was set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile with respect to the trust. U.S. equities are held for their high expected return. Non U.S. equities, debt securities, and real estate are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are to be diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers or investments. Duke Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. The expected long term rate of return of 8.5% for the Duke Energy U.S. assets was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers. The weighted average returns expected by asset classes were 4.2% for U.S. equities, 1.8% for Non U.S. equities, 2.2% for fixed income securities, and 0.3% for real estate. If Duke Energy had used a long term rate of 8.25% in 2006, pre tax pension expense would have been higher by approximately $8 million and pre tax other post retirement expense would have been higher by approximately $1 million. If Duke Energy had used a long term rate of 8.75% pre tax pension expense would have been lower by approximately $8 million and pre tax other post retirement expense would have been lower by approximately $1 million. Duke Energy discounted its future U.S. pension and other post retirement obligations using a rate of 5.75% as of September 30, 2006. Duke Energy discounted its future U.S. pension and other post retirement obligations using rates of 5.50% as of September 30, 2005 for its non legacy Cinergy business pension plans and 6.00% as of April 1, 2006 for its legacy Cinergy business pension plans. For legacy Cinergy plans, the discount rate reflects remeasurement as of April 1, 2006 due to the merger between Duke Energy and Cinergy. Duke Energy determines the appropriate discount based on a AA bond yield curve. The yield is selected based on bonds with cash flows that match the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments under the plan. Lowering the discount rates by 0.25% would have decreased Duke Energys 2006 pre tax pension expense by approximately $2 million. Increasing the discount rates by 0.25% would have increased Duke Energys 2006 pre tax pension expense by approximately $2 million. Lowering the discount rates by 0.25% would have increased Duke Energys 2006 pre tax other post retirement expense by approximately $1 million. Increasing the discount rate by 0.25% would have decreased Duke Energys 2006 pre tax other post retirement expense by approximately $1 million. Duke Energys U.S. post retirement plan uses a medical care trend rate which reflects the near and long term expectation of increases in medical health care costs. Duke Energys U.S. post retirement plan uses a prescription drug trend rate which reflects the near and long term expectation of increases in prescription drug health care costs. As of September 30, 2006, the medical care trend rates were 8.50%, which grades to 4.75% by 2013. As of September 30, 2006, the prescription drug trend rate was 13.00%, which grades to 4.75% by 2022. If Duke Energy had used health care trend rates one percentage point higher, pre tax other post retirement expense would have been higher by $6 million. If Duke Energy had used health care trend rates one percentage point lower, pre tax other post retirement expense would have been lower by $5 million. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in Duke Energys pension and post retirement plans will impact Duke Energys future pension expense and liabilities. Management cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future. Westcoast Plans Westcoast and its subsidiaries maintain contributory and non contributory defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution (DC) retirement plans covering substantially all employees. The DB plans provide retirement benefits based on each plan participants years of service and final average earnings. Under the DC plans, company contributions are determined according to the terms of the plan and based on each plan participants age, years of service and current eligible earnings. Westcoast also provides health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a non contributory basis. Employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement, as defined in the plans. Effective December 31, 2003, a new plan was implemented for all non bargaining employees and the majority of bargaining employees. The new plan applied to employees retiring on and after January 1, 2006. The new plan is predominantly a defined contribution plan as compared to the existing defined benefit program. 68 Table of Contents PART II Westcoast recognized pre tax pension cost of $22 million, pre tax non qualified pension cost of $6 million and pre tax other post retirement benefits cost of $12 million in 2006. In 2007, As a result of the spin off of the natural gas businesses, Duke Energy will not incur any future pension costs associated with the Westcoast plan. The expected long term rate of return for the Westcoast plans assets was 7.25% as of September 30, 2006. The Westcoast plans assets for registered pension plans are maintained by a master trust. The investment objective of the master trust is to achieve reasonable returns on trust assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants. The asset allocation target was set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile with respect to the trust. Canadian equities are held for their high expected return. Non Canadian equities are held for their high expected return as well as diversification relative to Canadian equities and debt securities. Debt securities are also held for diversification. The expected long term rate of return of 7.25% and 7.50% as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, for the Westcoast assets was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers. The weighted average returns expected by asset classes were 2.5% for Canadian equities, 1.3% for U.S. equities, 1.4% for Europe, Australasia and Far East equities, and 2.0% for fixed income securities. For 2006, the expected long term rate of return used to calculate pension expense was 7.5%. Lowering the expected rate of return on assets by 0.25% (from 7.50% to 7.25%) would have increased Westcoasts 2006 pre tax pension expense by approximately $1 million. Increasing the expected rate of return by 0.25% (from 7.50% to 7.75%) would have decreased Westcoasts 2006 pre tax pension expense by approximately $1 million. The Westcoast other post retirement plan does not hold any assets. Westcoast discounted its future pension and other post retirement obligations using a rate of 5.00% as of September 30, 2006 and 2005. For Westcoast, the discount rate used to determine the pension and other post retirement obligations is prescribed as the yield on Canadian corporate AA bonds at the measurement date of September 30. The yield is selected based on bonds with cash flows that match the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments under the plan. For 2006, the discount rate used to calculate pension expense was 5.00%. Lowering the discount rate by 0.25% (from 5.00% to 4.75%) would have increased Duke Energys 2006 pre tax pension expense by approximately $2 million. Increasing the discount rate by 0.25% (from 5.00% to 5.25%) would have decreased Duke Energys 2006 pre tax pension expense by approximately $2 million. Lowering the discount rate by 0.25% (from 5.00% to 4.75%) would have increased Duke Energys 2006 pre tax other post retirement expense by approximately $1 million. Increasing the discount rate by 0.25% (from 5.00% to 5.25%) would have decreased Duke Energys 2006 pre tax other post retirement expense by approximately $1 million. The Westcoast post retirement plans use a medical care trend rate which reflects the near and long term expectation of increases in medical costs. As of September 30, 2006, the health care trend rates were 8.00%, which grades to 5.00% by 2009. If Westcoast had used a health care trend rate one percentage point higher, pre tax other post retirement expense would have been higher by $2 million. If Westcoast had used a health care trend rate one percentage point lower, pre tax other post retirement expense would have been lower by less than $1 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Known Trends and Uncertainties Duke Energy will rely primarily upon cash flows from operations, as well as its cash, cash equivalents and short term investments to fund its liquidity and capital requirements for 2007. The current cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and future cash generated from operations may be used by Duke Energy to continue with its February 2005 announced plan to periodically repurchase up to an aggregate of $2.5 billion of common stock over a three year period. In June 2006, the share repurchase plan was suspended. At the time of the suspension of the repurchase plan, Duke Energy had repurchased approximately 50 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.4 billion since inception of the repurchase plan. In October 2006, Duke Energys Board of Directors authorized the reactivation of the share repurchase plan for Duke Energy of up to $500 million of share repurchases after the spin off of the natural gas businesses. In addition, Duke Energys future cash flows will be negatively impacted by the spin off of the natural gas businesses effective January 2, 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2006, operating, investing and financing cash flows provided/(used) by the natural gas businesses, including distributions from Duke Energys 50% investment in DEFS, were approximately $1.7 billion, $(0.6) billion and $(0.2) billion, respectively. A material adverse change in operations or available financing may impact Duke Energys ability to fund its current liquidity and capital resource requirements. Duke Energy currently anticipates net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 to be lower than in 2006, primarily as a result of the following: Lower operating cash flows as a result of the spin off of the natural gas businesses, as discussed above; and, 69 Table of Contents PART II Lower operating cash flows due to the sale of an effective 50% interest in the Crescent JV in September 2006. These lower operating cash flows are expected to be partially offset by the following: Lower costs incurred related to the merger with Cinergy; and, Higher operating results of legacy Cinergy businesses as a result of ownership for the entire year 2007. Additionally, Duke Energy anticipates funding its defined benefit pension plans with approximately $150 million of cash during 2007, as compared to $172 million during 2006. Ultimate cash flows from operations are subject to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory constraints, economic trends, and market volatility (see Item 1A. Risk Factors for details). Duke Energy projects 2007 capital and investment expenditures of approximately $3.3 billion, primarily consisting of approximately: $2.8 billion at U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, including $0.4 billion of North Carolina Clean Air Expenditures $0.3 billion at Commercial Power $0.2 billion combined at International Energy and Other Duke Energy continues to focus on reducing risk and restructuring its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business sectors with an overall focus on positive net cash generation. Based on this goal, approximately 85 percent of total projected 2007 capital expenditures are allocated to the U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas segment. Total U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas projected 2007 capital and investment expenditures include approximately $1.5 billion for maintenance and upgrades of existing plants and infrastructure to serve load growth, approximately $0.7 billion of environmental expenditures, and approximately $0.6 billion of expansion capital. Duke Energys U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas business segment is evaluating the construction of several large, new electric generating plants in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Indiana. During this evaluation process, Duke Energy has begun to see significant increases in the estimated costs of these projects driven by strong domestic and international demand for the material, equipment, and labor necessary to construct these facilities. In October 2006, Duke Energy made a filing with the NCUC related to the Duke Energy Carolinas request for a CPCN for the Cliffside project. In this filing, Duke Energy stated that due to the rising costs described above, the cost of building the Cliffside units could be approximately $3 billion, excluding AFUDC. The costs described above are expected to continue to increase causing the overall cost of the Cliffside project to increase, until such time as the NCUC issues a CPCN and Duke Energy is able to enter into definitive agreements with necessary material and service providers. On February 28, 2007, the NCUC issued a notice of decision approving the construction of one unit at the Cliffside Steam Station. The NCUC stated that it will issue a full order in the near future. Duke Energy will review the NCUCs order, once issued, and determine whether to proceed with the Cliffside Project or consider other alternatives, including additional gas fired generation. Duke Energy is attempting to obtain approval for the upfront recovery of development costs related to a proposed nuclear power plant. Duke Energy does not anticipate beginning construction of the proposed nuclear power plant without adequate assurance of cost recovery from the state regulators. In November 2006, Duke Energy received approval for nearly $260 million of future federal tax credits related to costs to be incurred for the modernization of the Cliffside facility as well as the Integrated Gasification on Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant in Indiana. Duke Energy Indianas estimated costs associated with the potential construction of an IGCC plant in Indiana have also increased. Duke Energy Indianas publicly filed testimony with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission indicates that industry (EPRI) total capital requirement estimates for a facility of this type and size are now in the range of $1.6 billion to $2.1 billion (including escalation to 2011 and owners specific site costs). Duke Energy anticipates its debt to total capitalization ratio to be approximately 38% by the end of 2007, as compared to 43% at the end of 2006. This reduction is primarily due to the impacts of the spin off the natural gas businesses in 2007. Duke Energy does not expect its total debt balance (including outstanding commercial paper balances) to change significantly in 2007, excluding the impacts of approximately $8.6 billion of debt transferred to Spectra Energy as a result of the spin off of the natural gas businesses. Excluding the debt which was transferred in connection with the spin off of the natural gas businesses on January 2, 2007, Duke Energy has expected debt maturities of approximately $1.1 billion in 2007. Duke Energy expects to refinance approximately $0.5 billion of these maturities. Based upon anticipated 2007 cash flows from operations and capital expenditure and dividend payment plans, Duke Energy expects to increase outstanding commercial paper balances by approximately $0.6 billion during 2007. Current total available capacity under Duke Energys commercial paper facilities is sufficient to meet these additional requirements. Duke Energy monitors compliance with all debt covenants and restrictions, and does not currently believe that it will be in violation or breach of its debt covenants. However, circumstances could arise that may alter that view. If and when management had a belief that such potential breach could exist, appropriate action would be taken to mitigate any such issue. Duke Energy also maintains an active 70 Table of Contents PART II dialogue with the credit rating agencies, and believes that the current credit ratings are positioned for potential improvement evidenced by positive outlooks at Duke Energy and most of its subsidiaries. Operating Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,748 million in 2006 compared to $2,818 million in 2005, an increase of $930 million. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the following: The impacts of the merger with Cinergy, effective April 3, 2006, Collateral received by Duke Energy (approximately $540 million) in 2006 from Barclays, partially offset by The settlement of the payable to Barclays (approximately $600 million) in 2006, and An approximate $400 million decrease in 2006 due to the net settlement of the remaining DENA contracts. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,818 million in 2005 compared to $4,168 million in 2004, a decrease of $1,350 million. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the following: Approximately $750 million of additional net cash collateral posted by Duke Energy during 2005 attributable to increased crude oil prices, as well as increases to the forward market prices of power, An approximate $900 million increase in taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2005, and, The impacts of the deconsolidation of DEFS effective July 1, 2005. These decreases were offset by an increase in cash provided due to an approximate $234 million decrease in contributions to company sponsored pension plans in 2005. Investing Cash Flows Net cash used in investing activities was $1,328 million in 2006 compared to $126 million in 2005, an increase in cash used of $1,202 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $126 million in 2005 compared to $793 million in 2004, a decrease in cash used of $667 million. The primary use of cash related to investing activities is capital and investment expenditures, detailed by business segment in the following table. Capital and Investment Expenditures by Business Segment Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas(a) $ 2,381 $ 1,350 $ 1,126 Natural Gas Transmission 790 930 544 Field Services(b) 86 202 Commercial Power 209 2 7 International Energy 58 23 28 Crescent(c)(d) 507 599 568 Other 131 29 54 Total consolidated $ 4,076 $ 3,019 $ 2,529 (a) Amounts include capital expenditures associated with North Carolina clean air legislation of $403 million in 2006, $310 million in 2005 and $106 million in 2004 which are included in Capital Expenditures within Cash Flows from Investing Activities on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. (b) As a result of the deconsolidation of DEFS, effective July 1, 2005, Field Services amounts for 2005 only include DEFS capital and investment expenditures for periods prior to July 1, 2005. (c) Amounts include capital expenditures associated with residential real estate of $322 million for the period from January 1, 2006 through the date of deconsolidation (September 7, 2006), $355 million in 2005, and $322 million in 2004 which are included in Capital Expenditures for Residential Real Estate within Cash Flows from Operating Activities on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. (d) As a result of the deconsolidation of Crescent, effective September 7, 2006, Crescent amounts for 2006 only include Crescent capital and investment expenditures for periods prior to September 7, 2006. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily due to the following: Increased capital and investment expenditures of $1,090 million, excluding Crescents residential real estate investment, primarily as a result of capital expenditures at U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, primarily due to the acquisition of Cinergy in April 2006, the acquisition of the Rockingham facility in 2006 and increased expenditures associated with North Carolina clean air legislation; and, 71 Table of Contents PART II Increased purchases of short term investments of approximately $900 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, due primarily to the proceeds from the Crescent debt financing. These increases were partially offset by the following: An increase in proceeds received from asset sales in 2006 as compared to 2005. Asset sales activity in 2006 of approximately $2.9 billion primarily involved the disposal of the former DENA operations outside of the Midwestern United States, Cinergys commercial marketing and trading business operations, as well as the Crescent JV transaction. Asset sales activity in 2005 of approximately $2.4 billion primarily involved the disposition of the investments in TEPPCO as well as the DEFS disposition transaction. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2005 as compared to 2004 is primarily due to the following: An increase in proceeds from the sale of assets in 2005 as compared to 2004. Asset sales activity in 2005 of approximately $2.4 billion primarily involved the disposition of the investments in TEPPCO as well as the DEFS disposition transaction. Asset sales activity in 2004 of approximately $1.6 billion primarily involved the sales of the Asia Pacific Business, Southeast Plants and Moapa and Luna partially completed facilities; and, Decreased amounts of cash invested in short term investments in 2005 as compared to 2004. These decreases were partially offset by the following: Increased capital and investment expenditures, excluding Crescents residential real estate investments, of $460 million primarily as a result of the approximate $230 million acquisition of the Empress System at Natural Gas Transmission and an increase in expenditures associated with North Carolina clean air legislation. Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity Duke Energys consolidated capital structure as of December 31, 2006, including short term debt, was 43% debt, 55% common equity and 2% minority interests. The fixed charges coverage ratio, calculated using SEC guidelines, was 3.2 times for 2006, which includes a pre tax gain of approximately $250 million on the sale of an effective 50% interest in Crescent, 4.7 times for 2005, which includes a pre tax gain on the sale of TEPPCO GP and LP of approximately $0.9 billion, net of minority interest, and 2.3 times for 2004. Net cash used in financing activities was $1,961 million in 2006 compared to $2,717 million in 2005, a decrease of $756 million. The change was due primarily to the following: An approximate $1.1 billion increase in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in 2006, net of redemptions, due primarily to the approximate $1.2 billion of debt proceeds from the Crescent JV transaction, and An approximate $400 million decrease in share repurchases under Duke Energys share repurchase plan. These increases were partially offset by: An approximate $400 million increase in dividends paid due to the increase in the quarterly dividend paid per share combined with a larger number of shares outstanding, primarily attributable to the 313 million shares issued in connection with the Cinergy merger, and The repayment of approximately $400 million of notes payable and commercial paper in 2006 due primarily to proceeds received from asset sales. Net cash used in financing activities was $2,717 million in 2005 compared to $3,278 million in 2004, a decrease of $561 million. The change was due primarily to the following: Approximately $3.0 billion of lower redemptions, net of paydowns, of long term debt, commercial paper, notes payable, preferred and preference stock, and preferred stock of a subsidiary during 2005 as compared to 2004 as a result of an effort to reduce debt balances in 2004. This decrease was partially offset by: Approximately $2.6 billion of lower proceeds from common stock transactions during 2005, primarily driven by the settlement of the forward purchase contract component of Duke Energys Equity Units in May and November 2004 for total proceeds of $1.7 billion and the repurchase of 32.6 million shares of common stock for $933 million in 2005. With cash, cash equivalents and short term investments on hand at December 31, 2006 of approximately $2.5 billion and a more stable portfolio of businesses, Duke Energy has financial flexibility to buy back common stock, invest incrementally or pay down additional debt. Duke Energy is evaluating these options and will determine the best economic decision to meet the needs of shareholders and the long term financial strength of Duke Energy. 72 Table of Contents PART II Significant Financing Activities Year Ended 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006, Duke Energys consolidated credit capacity increased by approximately $842 million, primarily due to the merger with Cinergy. This increase was net of other reductions in credit capacity due to the terminations of an $800 million syndicated credit facility and $590 million of other bi lateral credit facilities. The terminations of these credit facilities primarily reflect Duke Energys reduced liquidity needs as a result of exiting the former DENA business. During the year ended December 31, 2006, Duke Energy increased the portion of outstanding commercial paper and pollution control bond balances classified as long term from $472 million to $929 million. This non current classification is due to the existence of long term credit facilities which back stop these balances along with Duke Energys intent to refinance such balances on a long term basis. During 2006, Duke Energy has repurchased approximately 17.5 million shares of its common stock for approximately $500 million. In November 2006, Union Gas issued 4.85% fixed rate debenture bonds denominated in 125 million Canadian dollars (approximately $108 million U.S. dollar equivalents as of the closing date) due in 2022. In October 2006, Duke Energy Carolinas issued $150 million in tax exempt floating rate bonds. The bonds are structured as variable rate demand bonds, subject to weekly remarketing and bear a final maturity of 2031. The initial interest rate was set at 3.72%. The bonds are supported by an irrevocable 3 year direct pay letter of credit and were issued through the North Carolina Capital Facilities Finance Agency to fund a portion of the environmental capital expenditures at the Marshall and Belews Creek Steam Stations. During October 2006, the $130 million bi lateral credit facility at Spectra Energy Capital was cancelled. In addition, the remaining $120 million bi lateral credit facility was cancelled in November 2006 and reissued at Duke Energy for the same amount with the same terms and conditions. In September 2006, prior to the completion of the partial sale of Crescent to the MS Members as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions and Dispositions, Crescent issued approximately $1.23 billion principal amount of debt. The net proceeds from the debt issuance of approximately $1.21 billion were recorded as a Financing Activity on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As a result of Duke Energys deconsolidation of Crescent effective September 7, 2006, Crescents outstanding debt balance of $1,298 million was removed from Duke Energys Consolidated Balance Sheets. In September 2006, Union Gas entered into a fixed rate financing agreement denominated in 165 million Canadian dollars (approximately $148 million in U.S. dollar equivalents as of the issuance date) due in 2036 with an interest rate of 5.46%. In September 2006, the Income Fund sold approximately 9 million previously unissued Trust Units at a price of 12.15 Canadian dollars per Trust Unit for total proceeds of 104 million Canadian dollars, net of commissions and expenses of other expenses of issuance. The sale of approximately 9 million Trust Units reduced Duke Energys ownership interest in the Income Fund to approximately 46% at December 31, 2006. As a result of the sale of additional Trust Units, Duke Energy recognized an approximate $15 million U.S. Dollar pre tax SAB No. 51 gain on the sale of subsidiary stock. The proceeds from the offering plus the draw down of approximately 39 million Canadian dollars on an available credit facility were used by the Income Fund to acquire a 100% interest in Westcoast Gas Services, Inc. Subsequent to this transaction, Duke Energy had an approximate 46% ownership interest in the Income Fund. In August 2006, Duke Energy Kentucky issued approximately $77 million principal amount of floating rate tax exempt notes due August 1, 2027. Proceeds from the issuance were used to refund a like amount of debt on September 1, 2006 then outstanding at Duke Energy Ohio. Approximately $27 million of the floating rate debt was swapped to a fixed rate concurrent with closing. In June 2006, Duke Energy Indiana issued $325 million principal amount of 6.05% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2016. Proceeds from the issuance were used to repay $325 million of 6.65% First Mortgage Bonds that matured on June 15, 2006. During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2006, Duke Energys $742 million of convertible debt became convertible into approximately 31.7 million shares of Duke Energy common stock due to the market price of Duke Energy common stock achieving a specified threshold during each respective quarter. Holders of the convertible debt were able to exercise their right to convert on or prior to each quarter end. During the second and third quarters, approximately $632 million of debt was converted into approximately 26.7 million shares of Duke Energy Common Stock. At December 31, 2006, the balance of the convertible debt is approximately $110 million. Significant Financing Activities Year Ended 2005. In connection with the up to $2.5 billion share repurchase program announced in February 2005, Duke Energy entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction. Duke Energy repurchased and retired 30 million shares of its common stock from an investment bank at the March 18, 2005 closing price of $27.46 per share (total of approximately $834 million, including approximately $10 million in commissions and other fees). The final settlement with the investment bank occurred on September 22, 2005 for approximately $25 million in cash. The final settlement price was the difference between the initial settlement price of $27.46 per share and the volume weighted average price per share of actual shares purchased by the investment bank of $28.42 per share. Duke Energy also entered into a separate open market purchase plan with the investment bank on March 18, 2005 to repurchase up to an additional 20 million shares of its common stock through December 27, 2005. As of May 9, 2005 (the date Duke 73 Table of Contents PART II and Cinergy announced a merger agreement), Duke Energy had already repurchased 2.6 million shares of its common stock through the separate open market purchase plan at a weighted average price of $28.97 per share. In May 2005, in connection with the anticipated merger with Cinergy, Duke Energy suspended additional repurchases under the open market purchase plan. For the year ended December 31, 2005 a total of 32.6 million shares of common stock were repurchased under both share repurchase programs for approximately $933 million. In December 2005, the Income Fund, a Canadian income trust fund, was created which sold approximately 40% ownership in the Canadian Midstream operations for proceeds, net of underwriting discount, of approximately $110 million. In January 2006, a subsequent greenshoe sale of additional ownership interests, pursuant to an overallotment option, in the Income Fund were sold for approximately $10 million. In November 2005, International Energy issued floating rate debt in Guatemala for $87 million (in USD) and in El Salvador for $75 million (in USD). These debt issuances have variable interest rate terms and mature in 2015. On September 21, 2005, Union Gas entered into a fixed rate financing agreement denominated in 200 million Canadian dollars (approximately $171 million in U.S. dollar equivalents as of the issuance date) due in 2016 with an interest rate of 4.64%. In August 2005, DEI issued project level debt in Peru, of which $75 million is denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately $34 million (in U.S. dollar equivalents as of the issuance date) is denominated in Peru Nuevos Soles. This debt has terms ranging from four to six years as well as variable or fixed interest rate terms, as applicable. On March 1, 2005, redemption notices were sent to the bondholders of the $100 million PanEnergy 8.625% bonds due in 2025. These bonds were redeemed on April 15, 2005 at a redemption price of 104.03 or approximately $104 million. During the first quarter of 2005, Duke Energy increased the portion of outstanding commercial paper balances classified as long term debt from $150 million to $300 million. This non current classification is due to the existence of long term credit facilities which back stop these commercial paper balances along with Duke Energys intent to refinance such balances on a long term basis. In December 2004, Duke Energy reached an agreement to sell its partially completed Grays Harbor power generation facility (Grays Harbor) to an affiliate of Invenergy LLC. In 2004, Duke Energy terminated its capital lease with the dedicated pipeline which would have transported natural gas to Grays Harbor. As a result of this termination, approximately $94 million was paid by Duke Energy in January 2005. Preferred and Preference Stock of Duke Energy. In December 2005, Duke Energy redeemed all Preferred and Preference stock without Sinking Fund Requirements for approximately $137 million and recognized an immaterial loss on the redemption. Available Credit Facilities and Restrictive Debt Covenants. Duke Energys credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and or termination of the agreements. As of December 31, 2006, Duke Energy was in compliance with those covenants. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or to the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses. (For information on Duke Energys credit facilities as of December 31, 2006, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt and Credit Facilities.) Credit Ratings. Duke Energy and certain subsidiaries each hold credit ratings by Standard & Poors (S&P) and Moodys Investors Service (Moodys). In addition, certain subsidiaries transferred to Spectra Energy hold credit ratings by DBRS (formerly Dominion Bond Rating Service). Actions taken by ratings agencies subsequent to January 2, 2007 related to businesses transferred to Spectra Energy are not reflected herein since such actions have no impact on the ongoing operations of Duke Energy post spin off. In May 2006, S&P changed the outlook of Duke Energy and all of its subsidiaries (with the exception of Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, LLC and Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, LP (collectively M&N Pipeline) and DETM from stable to positive reflecting Duke Energys announcement to sell Cinergys commercial trading and marketing operations. In April 2006, following the completion of Duke Energys merger with Cinergy, S&P removed Cinergy and its subsidiaries from credit watch negative where they had been placed in May 2005 following the Cinergy merger announcement. S&P lowered Cinergys Corporate Credit Rating (CCR) consistent with Duke Energys CCR as disclosed in the table below. As a result of Cinergys lower CCR, S&P lowered the senior unsecured credit rating of Cinergy Corp. reflecting the structural subordination of its debt. In addition, S&P reassessed its view of the structural subordination for the debt outstanding at Spectra Energy Capital, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana, and Duke Energy Kentucky and assigned the senior unsecured credit ratings at these entities equal to Duke Energys CCR. This resulted in the senior unsecured credit rating of Spectra Energy Capital being raised one ratings level to BBB and no changes to the senior unsecured 74 Table of Contents PART II ratings of Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana, and Duke Energy Kentucky as disclosed in the table below. At the same time, S&P assigned a senior unsecured credit rating to Duke Energy Carolinas equal to Duke Energys CCR and left the credit ratings of the Spectra Energy Capital subsidiaries (Texas Eastern Transmission, LP, Westcoast, Union Gas and M&N Pipeline) and DETM unchanged. At the completion of S&Ps April action, all the credit ratings were on stable outlook. S&P last affirmed its credit ratings for M&N Pipeline in July 2006 where they have remained unchanged with a stable outlook for the last several years. In April 2006, upon Duke Energys completion of the merger with Cinergy, Moodys upgraded the credit ratings of Duke Energy Carolinas (formerly rated as Duke Energy by Moodys prior to the merger), Spectra Energy Capital and Texas Eastern Transmission, LP one ratings level each and assigned an issuer rating to New Duke Energy. The credit ratings resulting from the April action are as disclosed in the table below, except for businesses transferred to Spectra Energy entities as discussed above. The credit ratings of Spectra Energy Capital and Texas Eastern Transmission, LP were Baa2 and Baa1 respectively following Moodys April action. Moodys concluded their April action placing New Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas on positive outlook and Spectra Energy Capital and Texas Eastern Transmission, LP on stable outlook. Moodys also confirmed all of Cinergy and its subsidiaries credit ratings and changed the outlook to positive with the exception of Duke Energy Indiana, which was left on stable outlook. Moodys noted in their April action the substantial reduction in business and operating risk of Duke Energy Carolinas from the distribution of its ownership in Spectra Energy Capital to a new holding company (New Duke Energy) and the substantial reduction in business and operating risk of Spectra Energy Capital through the restructuring of its ownership in DEFS and the divestiture of the former DENA merchant generation assets and trading book. Moodys also noted the upgrade at Texas Eastern Transmission, LP in parallel to its parent Spectra Energy Capital. In August 2005, Moodys concluded a review of M&N Pipeline and downgraded the credit ratings one ratings level to A2 concluding this action with a stable outlook. Moodys action was primarily as a result of their concerns over the downward revisions in the reserve estimates for the Sable Offshore Energy Project (SOEI) and reduced production by SOEI producers. In August 2006, Moodys revised the outlook for Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, LLC to negative, noting the potential for a somewhat weaker shipper profile resulting from a recently announced expansion project on the U.S. portion of the pipeline. The most recent rating action by DBRS occurred in June 2006 when DBRS confirmed the stable trend of Westcoast, Union Gas and M&N Pipeline following Duke Energys announcement of the separation of the electric and gas businesses. Each of the credit ratings assigned by DBRS to these entities has remained unchanged for the last several years with a stable trend. The following table summarizes the February 1, 2007 credit ratings from the agencies retained by Duke Energy, its principal funding subsidiaries and Duke Energys trading and marketing subsidiary DETM. Credit Ratings Summary as of February 1, 2007 Standard andPoors MoodysInvestor Service Duke Energy(a) BBB Baa2 Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC(b) BBB A3 Cinergy(b) BBB Baa2 Duke Energy Ohio, Inc.(b) BBB Baa1 Duke Energy Indiana, Inc.(b) BBB Baa1 Duke Energy Kentucky, Inc.(b) BBB Baa1 Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC(c) BBB Not applicable (a) Represents corporate credit rating and issuer rating for S&P and Moodys respectively (b) Represents senior unsecured credit rating (c) Represents corporate credit rating These entities credit ratings are dependent upon, among other factors, the ability to generate sufficient cash to fund capital and investment expenditures, while maintaining the strength of their current balance sheets. These credit ratings could be negatively impacted if as a result of market conditions or other factors, these entities are unable to maintain their current balance sheet strength, or if earnings and cash flow outlook materially deteriorates. During the third quarter of 2005, the Board of Directors of Duke Energy authorized and directed management to execute the sale or disposition of substantially all of former DENAs remaining assets and contracts outside the Midwestern United States. On November 18, 2005, Duke Energy announced it signed an agreement to transfer substantially all of the former DENA portfolio of derivatives contracts to Barclays. Under the agreement, Barclays acquired substantially all of former DENAs outstanding gas and power derivatives contracts 75 Table of Contents PART II which essentially eliminated Duke Energys credit, collateral, market and legal risk associated with former DENAs derivative trading positions effective on the date of signing. Substantially all of the underlying contracts have been transferred to Barclays. Duke Energy operated a commercial marketing and trading business that was acquired as part of the merger with Cinergy in April 2006. In June 2006, Duke Energy announced it had reached an agreement to sell Cinergys commercial marketing and trading business, as well as associated contracts. The sale closed in October 2006 and, upon closing, the buyer assumed the credit, collateral, market and legal risk associated with the trading positions acquired. A reduction in the credit rating of Duke Energy to below investment grade as of December 31, 2006 would have resulted in Duke Energy posting additional collateral of up to approximately $377 million, including impacts of Cinergy and excluding any collateral requirements associated with the spin off of the natural gas businesses in January 2007. The majority of this collateral is related to outstanding surety bonds. Duke Energy would fund any additional collateral requirements through a combination of cash on hand and the use of credit facilities. Additionally, if credit ratings for Duke Energy or its affiliates fall below investment grade there is likely to be a negative impact on its working capital and terms of trade that is not possible to fully quantify, in addition to the posting of additional collateral and segregation of cash described above. Clauses. Duke Energy may be required to repay certain debt should the credit ratings of Duke Energy Carolinas fall to a certain level at S&P or Moodys. As of December 31, 2006, Duke Energy had $13 million of senior unsecured notes which mature serially through 2012 that may be required to be repaid if Duke Energy Carolinas senior unsecured debt ratings fall below BBB at S&P or Baa3 at Moodys, and $23 million of senior unsecured notes which mature serially through 2016 that may be required to be repaid if Duke Energy Carolinas senior unsecured debt ratings fall below BBB at S&P or Baa2 at Moodys. Other Financing Matters. As of December 31, 2006, Duke Energy and its subsidiaries had effective SEC shelf registrations for up to $2,467 million in gross proceeds from debt and other securities, which include approximately $925 million of effective registrations at legacy Cinergy. Additionally, as of December 31, 2006, Duke Energy had 935 million Canadian dollars (approximately U.S. $807 million) available under Canadian shelf registrations for issuances in the Canadian market. Of the 935 million Canadian dollars available under Canadian shelf registrations, 500 million expires in May 2008 and 435 million expires in August 2008. Amounts available under U.S. and Canadian shelf registrations of approximately $592 million and 935 million Canadian dollars, respectively, relate to businesses included in the spin off of the natural gas businesses on January 2, 2007 and, accordingly, are not available to Duke Energy subsequent to the consummation of the spin off. Duke Energy expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends. There is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements, and financial condition. Duke Energy has paid quarterly cash dividends for 81 consecutive years. Dividends on common and preferred stocks in 2007 are expected to be paid on March 15, June 18, September 17 and December 17, subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. Prior to June 2004, Duke Energys Investor Direct Choice Plan allowed investors to reinvest dividends in common stock and to purchase common stock directly from Duke Energy. In June 2004, Duke Energy changed the method of dividend reinvestment to open market purchases. There were no issuances of common stock under the plan in either 2006 or 2005. Issuances of common stock under the plan were $36 million in 2004. Duke Energy also sponsors an employee savings plan that covers substantially all U.S. employees. In April 2004, Duke Energy stopped issuing shares under the plan and the plan began making open market purchases with cash provided by Duke Energy. There were no issuances of common stock under the plan in 2006 or 2005. Issuances of common stock under the plan were $51 million in 2004. Duke Energy also issues shares of its common stock to meet other employee benefit requirements. Issuances of common stock to meet other employee benefit requirements were approximately $126 million in 2006, approximately $39 million for 2005 and approximately $12 million for 2004. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Duke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include financial and performance guarantees, stand by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. These arrangements are largely entered into by Duke Energy, Spectra Energy Capital and Cinergy. (See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Guarantees and Indemnifications, for further details of the guarantee arrangements.) 76 Table of Contents PART II Most of the guarantee arrangements entered into by Duke Energy enhance the credit standing of certain subsidiaries, non consolidated entities or less than wholly owned entities, enabling them to conduct business. As such, these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility of Duke Energy, Spectra Energy Capital or Cinergy having to honor its contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events. Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of Duke Energys operations. Thus, if Duke Energy discontinued issuing these guarantee arrangements, there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In contemplation of the spin off of the natural gas businesses on January 2, 2007, certain guarantees that were previously issued by Spectra Energy Capital were transferred to Duke Energy prior to the consummation of the spin off. This resulted in Duke Energy recording an immaterial liability for certain guarantees that were previously grandfathered under the provisions of FIN 45 and, therefore, were not recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Guarantees issued by Spectra Energy Capital or Natural Gas Transmission on or prior to December 31, 2006 remained with Spectra Energy Capital subsequent to the spin off, except for certain guarantees that are in the process of being assigned to Duke Energy. During this assignment period, Duke Energy has indemnified Spectra Energy Capital against any losses incurred under these guarantee obligations. Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky have an agreement to sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections. Cinergy formed Cinergy Receivables to purchase, on a revolving basis, nearly all of the retail accounts receivable and related collections of Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky. Cinergy does not consolidate Cinergy Receivables since it meets the requirements to be accounted for as a qualifying special purpose entity (SPE). Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky each retain an interest in the receivables transferred to Cinergy Receivables. The transfers of receivables are accounted for as sales, pursuant to SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. For a more detailed discussion of our sales of accounts receivable, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Variable Interest Entities. Cinergy holds interests in variable interest entities (VIEs), consolidated and unconsolidated, as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. For further information, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Duke Energy does not have any other material off balance sheet financing entities or structures, except for normal operating lease arrangements and guarantee arrangements. (For additional information on these commitments, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Guarantees and Indemnifications.) Contractual Obligations Duke Energy enters into contracts that require payment of cash at certain specified periods, based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices. The following table summarizes Duke Energys contractual cash obligations for each of the periods presented. The table below excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long term debt, as well as future obligations of businesses included in the spin off of Spectra Energy on January 2, 2007. It is expected that the majority of current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets will be paid in cash in 2007. 77 Table of Contents PART II Contractual Obligations as of December 31, 2006 Payments Due By Period Total Less than 1 year (2007) 2 3 Years (2008 & 2009) 4 5 Years (2010 & 2011) More than 5 Years (Beyond 2012) (in millions) Long term debt(a) $ 17,879 $ 1,695 $ 3,504 $ 1,749 $ 10,931 Capital leases(a) 113 15 36 25 37 Operating leases(b) 522 86 150 101 185 Purchase Obligations:(g) Firm capacity payments(c) 51 18 18 15 Energy commodity contracts(d) 5,189 1,872 1,901 918 498 Other purchase obligations(e) 2,065 912 778 39 336 Other long term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets(f) 4,724 425 816 908 2,575 Total contractual cash obligations $ 30,543 $ 5,023 $ 7,203 $ 3,755 $ 14,562 (a) See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt and Credit Facilities. Amount includes interest payments over life of debt or capital lease. (b) See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies. (c) Includes firm capacity payments that provide Duke Energy with uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission capacity, refining capacity and the option to convert natural gas to electricity at third party owned facilities (tolling arrangements) in some power locations throughout North America. Also includes firm capacity payments under electric power agreements entered into to meet U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas native load requirements. (d) Includes contractual obligations to purchase physical quantities of electricity, coal and nuclear fuel. Amount includes certain normal purchases, energy derivatives and hedges per SFAS No. 133. For contracts where the price paid is based on an index, the amount is based on forward market prices at December 31, 2006. For certain of these amounts, Duke Energy may settle on a net cash basis since Duke Energy has entered into payment netting agreements with counterparties that permit Duke Energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. (e) Includes U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas obligation to purchase an additional ownership interest in the Catawba Nuclear Station (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Joint Ownership of Generating and Transmission Facilities), as well as contracts for software, telephone, data and consulting or advisory services. Amount also includes contractual obligations for engineering, procurement and construction costs for nuclear plant refurbishments, environmental projects on fossil facilities, pipeline and real estate projects, and major maintenance of certain merchant plants. Amount excludes certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand, and the timing of the purchase can not be determined. (f) Includes expected retirement plan contributions for 2007 (see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Employee Benefit Plans), certain estimated executive benefits, and contributions to the NDTF (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligations). The amount of cash flows to be paid to settle the asset retirement obligations is not known with certainty as Duke Energy may use internal resources or external resources to perform retirement activities. As a result, cash obligations for asset retirement activities are excluded. Asset retirement obligations recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets total $2,301 million and the fair value of the NDTF, which will be used to help fund these obligations, is $1,775 million at December 31, 2006. Amount excludes reserves for litigation, environmental remediation, asbestos related injuries and damages claims and self insurance claims (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies) because Duke Energy is uncertain as to the timing of when cash payments will be required. Additionally, amount excludes annual insurance premiums that are necessary to operate the business, including nuclear insurance (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies), funding of other post employment benefits (see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Employee Benefit Plans) and regulatory credits (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters) because the amount and timing of the cash payments are uncertain. Also amount excludes Deferred Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets since cash payments for income taxes are determined based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year. Liabilities Associated with Assets Held for Sale (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale) are also excluded as Duke Energy expects these liabilities will be assumed by the buyer upon sale of the assets. (g) Purchase obligations reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been excluded from the above table. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Risk and Accounting Policies Duke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, credit exposure, interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board receives periodic updates from the Treasurer and other members of management, on market risk positions, corporate exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management activities. The Treasurer is responsible for the overall governance of managing credit risk and commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits. See Critical Accounting Policies Risk Management Accounting and Revenue Recognition Trading and Marketing Revenues for further discussion of the accounting for derivative contracts. Disclosures about market risks related to businesses transferred to Spectra Energy in January 2007 are not reflected herein since such exposures have no impact on the ongoing operations of Duke Energy post spin off. 78 Table of Contents PART II Commodity Price Risk Duke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy related assets. Price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy employs established policies and procedures to manage its risks associated with these market fluctuations using various commodity derivatives, including swaps, futures, forwards and options. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Risk Management and Hedging Activities, Credit Risk, and Financial Instruments.) Validation of a contracts fair value is performed by an internal group independent of Duke Energys deal origination areas. While Duke Energy uses common industry practices to develop its valuation techniques, changes in Duke Energys pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition. Hedging Strategies. Duke Energy closely monitors the risks associated with these commodity price changes on its future operations and, where appropriate, uses various commodity instruments such as electricity, coal and natural gas forward contracts to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. Duke Energys primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the output and production of assets. To the extent that instruments accounted for as hedges are effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged, there is no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operations until delivery or settlement occurs. Accordingly, assumptions and valuation techniques for these contracts have no impact on reported earnings prior to settlement. Several factors influence the effectiveness of a hedge contract, including the use of contracts with different commodities or unmatched terms and counterparty credit risk. Hedge effectiveness is monitored regularly and measured each month. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Risk Management and Hedging Activities, Credit Risk, and Financial Instruments.) In addition to the hedge contracts described above and recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Duke Energy enters into other contracts that qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception described in paragraph 10 of SFAS No. 133, DIG Issue No. C15 and SFAS No. 149. For contracts qualifying for the scope exception, no recognition of the contracts fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is required until settlement of the contract unless the contract is designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge. On a limited basis, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas and Commercial Power apply the normal purchase and normal sales exception to certain contracts. Recognition for the contracts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations will be the same regardless of whether the contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges or as normal purchases and sales, unless designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge, assuming no hedge ineffectiveness. Income recognition and realization related to normal purchases and normal sales contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of power. However, Duke Energys decisions in 2004 to sell former DENA Southeast Plants, reduce former DENAs interest in partially completed plants and sale or disposition of substantially all of former DENAs remaining physical and commercial assets outside of the Midwestern United States and certain contractual positions related to the Midwestern assets (see Normal Purchases and Normal Sales below) required the reassessment of all associated derivatives, including normal purchases and normal sales. This required a change from the application of the Accrual Model to the MTM Model for these contracts and resulted in recording substantial unrealized losses that had not previously been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Generation Portfolio Risks. Duke Energy is primarily exposed to market price fluctuations of wholesale power and natural gas prices in the U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas and Commercial Power segments. Duke Energy optimizes the value of its bulk power marketing and non regulated generation portfolios. The portfolios include generation assets (power and capacity), fuel, and emission allowances. Modeled forecasts of future generation output, fuel requirements, and emission allowance requirements are based on forward power, fuel and emission allowance markets. The component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on this model in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio, where such market transparency exists. The generation portfolio not utilized to serve native load or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations. Based on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, it was estimated that a ten percent price change per mega watt hour in wholesale power prices would have a corresponding effect on Duke Energys pre tax income of approximately $30 million in 2007 and $20 million in 2006, respectively. Based on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2006, it was estimated that a ten percent price change per MMBtu in natural gas prices would have a corresponding effect on Duke Energys pre tax income of approximately $15 million in 2007. 79 Table of Contents PART II Normal Purchases and Normal Sales. During the third quarter of 2005, Duke Energys Board of Directors authorized and directed management to execute the sale or disposition of substantially all of former DENAs remaining assets and contracts outside the Midwestern United States, approximately 6,100 megawatts of power generation, and certain contractual positions related to the Midwestern assets (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale). As a result of this decision, Duke Energy recognized a pre tax loss of approximately $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2005 for the disqualification of its power and gas forward sales contracts previously designated under the normal purchases normal sales exception. This loss is partially offset by the recognition of a pre tax gain of approximately $1.2 billion for the discontinuance of hedge accounting for natural gas and power cash flow hedges. Duke Energy has retained the Midwestern generation assets in the Commercial Power segment, representing approximately 3,600 megawatts of power generation (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions and Dispositions for further details on the completed Cinergy merger). Trading and Undesignated Contracts. The risk in the trading portfolio is measured and monitored on a daily basis utilizing a Value at Risk (VaR) model to determine the potential one day favorable or unfavorable VaR calculation. Duke Energys VaR amounts for commodity derivatives recorded using the MTM Model are not material as a result of management decisions to dispose of certain businesses with higher risk profiles, including the former DENA operations outside the Midwestern United States and the Cinergy commercial marketing and trading businesses. In connection with the effort to reduce the risk profile, during 2006 Duke Energy finalized the sale of the former DENA power generation fleet outside of the Midwest to LS Power and sold the Cinergy commercial marketing and trading business to Fortis. Subsequent to the sales of both trading businesses, Duke Energy no longer uses VaR as a trading portfolio measure. Other Commodity Risks. Duke Energy, through Commercial Power, owns coal based synthetic fuel production facilities which convert coal feedstock into synthetic fuel for sale to third parties. The synthetic fuel produced at these facilities qualifies for tax credits (through 2007) in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 29/45K if certain requirements are satisfied. The Internal Revenue Code provides for a phase out of synthetic fuel tax credits if the average annual wellhead oil prices increase above certain levels. If Commercial Power were to operate its synthetic fuel facilities based on December 31, 2006 prices throughout the entire forthcoming year, yet crude oil prices were to rise such that the tax credit is completely phased out, projected net income in 2007 would be negatively impacted by approximately $100 million. Duke Energy is unlikely to experience a loss of this magnitude because the exposure to synthetic fuel tax credit phase out is monitored and Duke Energy may choose to reduce or cease synthetic fuel production depending on the expectation of any potential tax credit phase out. Duke Energy may also reduce its exposure to crude prices through the execution of derivative transactions. The objective of these activities is to reduce potential losses incurred if the reference price in a year exceeds a level triggering a phase out of synthetic fuel tax credits. Pre tax income for 2007 or 2006 was also not expected to be materially impacted as of December 31, 2006 or 2005 for exposures to other commodities price changes. These hypothetical calculations consider existing hedge positions and estimated production levels, but do not consider other potential effects that might result from such changes in commodity prices. Duke Energys exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including contract size, length, market liquidity, location and unique or specific contract terms. Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss that Duke Energy would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. To reduce credit exposure, Duke Energy seeks to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit Duke Energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Duke Energy attempts to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable Duke Energy to obtain collateral or to terminate or reset the terms of transactions after specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit related events. Duke Energy may, at times, use credit derivatives or other structures and techniques to provide for third party credit enhancement of Duke Energys counterparties obligations. Duke Energys principal customers for power and natural gas marketing and transportation services are industrial end users, marketers, local distribution companies and utilities located throughout the U.S., Canada and Latin America. Duke Energy has concentrations of receivables from natural gas and electric utilities and their affiliates, as well as industrial customers and marketers throughout these regions. These concentrations of customers may affect Duke Energys overall credit risk in that risk factors can negatively impact the credit quality of the entire sector. Where exposed to credit risk, Duke Energy analyzes the counterparties financial condition prior to entering into an agreement, establishes credit limits and monitors the appropriateness of those limits on an ongoing basis. 80 Table of Contents PART II The following table represents Duke Energys distribution of unsecured credit exposures at December 31, 2006, including Spectra Energy businesses. These credit exposures are aggregated by ultimate parent company, include on and off balance sheet exposures, are presented net of collateral, and take into account contractual netting rights. Distribution of Enterprise Credit Exposures As of December 31, 2006 % of Total Investment Grade Externally Rated 75 % Non Investment Grade Externally Rated 7 Investment Grade Internally Rated 8 Non Investment Grade Internally Rated 10 Total 100 % Externally Rated represents enterprise relationships that have published ratings from at least one major credit rating agency. Internally Rated represents those relationships which have no rating by a major credit rating agency. For those relationships, Duke Energy utilizes appropriate risk rating methodologies and credit scoring models to develop an internal risk rating which is intended to map to an external rating equivalent. The total of the unsecured credit exposure included in the table above represents approximately 59% of the gross fair value of Duke Energys Receivables and Unrealized Gains on Mark to Market and Hedging Transactions on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006. Duke Energy had no net exposure to any one customer that represented greater than 10% of the gross fair value of trade accounts receivable and unrealized gains on mark to market and hedging transactions at December 31, 2006. Excluding the businesses transferred to Spectra Energy in January 2007, the split between investment grade and non investment grade would have been approximately 70% and 30%, respectively. Based on Duke Energys policies for managing credit risk, its exposures and its credit and other reserves, Duke Energy does not anticipate a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non performance by any counterparty. During 2006, Duke Energy finalized the sale of the former DENA portfolio of derivative contracts to Barclays and sold the Cinergy commercial marketing and trading business to Fortis, which eliminated Duke Energys credit, collateral, market and legal risk associated with these related trading positions. In 1999, the Industrial Development Corp of the City of Edinburg, Texas (IDC) issued approximately $100 million in bonds to purchase equipment for lease to Duke Hidalgo (Hidalgo), a subsidiary of Spectra Energy Capital. Spectra Energy Capital unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the lease payments of Hidalgo to IDC through 2028. In 2000, Hidalgo was sold to Calpine Corporation and Spectra Energy Capital remained obligated under the lease guaranty. In January 2006, Hidalgo and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection in connection with the previous bankruptcy filing by its parent, Calpine Corporation in December 2005. Gross, undiscounted exposure under the guarantee obligation as of December 31, 2006 is approximately $200 million, including principal and interest payments. Duke Energy does not believe a loss under the guarantee obligation is probable as of December 31, 2006, but continues to evaluate the situation. Therefore, no reserves have been recorded for any contingent loss as of December 31, 2006. No demands for payment have been made under the guarantee. If losses are incurred under the guarantee, Spectra Energy Capital has certain rights which should allow it to mitigate such loss. Subsequent to the spin off the natural gas businesses, this guarantee remained with Spectra Energy Capital. However, Duke Energy indemnified Spectra Energy Capital against any future losses that could arise from payments required under this guarantee. Duke Energys industry has historically operated under negotiated credit lines for physical delivery contracts. Duke Energy frequently uses master collateral agreements to mitigate certain credit exposures. The collateral agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. The threshold amount represents an unsecured credit limit, determined in accordance with the corporate credit policy. Collateral agreements also provide that the inability to post collateral is sufficient cause to terminate contracts and liquidate all positions. Duke Energy also obtains cash or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on its financial analysis of the customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. 81 Table of Contents PART II Collateral amounts held or posted may be fixed or may vary depending on the terms of the collateral agreement and the nature of the underlying exposure and cover normal purchases and normal sales, hedging contracts, and optimization contracts outstanding. Duke Energy may be required to return certain held collateral and post additional collateral should price movements adversely impact the value of open contracts or positions. In many cases, Duke Energys and its counterparties publicly disclosed credit ratings impact the amounts of additional collateral to be posted. If Duke Energy or its affiliates have a credit rating downgrade, it could result in reductions in Duke Energys unsecured thresholds granted by counterparties. Likewise, downgrades in credit ratings of counterparties could require counterparties to post additional collateral to Duke Energy and its affiliates. (See Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity for additional discussion of downgrades.) Interest Rate Risk Duke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper. Duke Energy manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate exposures to percentages of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. Duke Energy also enters into financial derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. (See Notes 1, 8, and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Risk Management and Hedging Activities, Credit Risk, and Financial Instruments, and Debt and Credit Facilities.) Based on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2006, it was estimated that if market interest rates average 1% higher (lower) in 2007 than in 2006, interest expense, net of offsetting impacts in interest income, would increase (decrease) by approximately $3 million, excluding interest rate risk related to businesses transferred to Spectra Energy in January 2007. Comparatively, based on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2005, had interest rates averaged 1% higher (lower) in 2006 than in 2005, it was estimated that interest expense, net of offsetting impacts in interest income, would have increased (decreased) by approximately $9 million. These amounts were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges, short term investments, cash and cash equivalents outstanding as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The decrease in interest rate sensitivity was primarily due to the exclusion of interest rate risk, principally subsidiary debt and swaps, related to businesses transferred to Spectra Energy. If interest rates changed significantly, management would likely take actions to manage its exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in Duke Energys financial structure. Equity Price Risk Duke Energy maintains trust funds, as required by the NRC and the NCUC, to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligations.) As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities, fixed rate, fixed income securities and cash and cash equivalents. Per NRC and NCUC requirements, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. Those investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. Accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas rates, and fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates do not affect Duke Energys consolidated results of operations. Earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered from U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas rates. Bison, Duke Energys wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary, maintains investments to fund various business risks and losses, such as workers compensation, property, business interruption and general liability. Those investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. Duke Energys costs of providing non contributory defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rate, the rate of increase in health care costs and contributions made to the plans. Foreign Currency Risk Duke Energy is exposed to foreign currency risk from investments in international affiliate businesses owned and operated in foreign countries and from certain commodity related transactions within domestic operations. To mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, contracts may be denominated in or indexed to the U.S. Dollar and or local inflation rates, or investments may be naturally hedged through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency. Duke Energy may also use foreign currency derivatives, where possible, to manage its risk related to foreign currency fluctuations. To monitor its currency exchange rate risks, Duke Energy uses sensitivity analysis, which measures the impact of devaluation of the foreign currencies to which it has exposure. 82 Table of Contents PART II In 2007, Duke Energys primary foreign currency rate exposures are expected to be the Brazilian Real and the Peruvian New Sol. A 10% devaluation in the currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 in all of Duke Energys exposure currencies would result in an estimated net pre tax loss on the translation of local currency earnings of approximately $7 million to Duke Energys Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2007. The Consolidated Balance Sheet would be negatively impacted by approximately $120 million currency translation through the cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI as of December 31, 2006 as a result of a 10% devaluation in the currency exchange rates. OTHER ISSUES Spin off of the Natural Gas Businesses. In June 2006, the Board of Directors of Duke Energy authorized management to pursue a plan to create two separate publicly traded companies by spinning off Duke Energys natural gas businesses to Duke Energy shareholders. The spin off was effective January 2, 2007. The new natural gas company, which is named Spectra Energy, principally consists of Duke Energys Natural Gas Transmission business segment, which includes Union Gas, and also includes Duke Energys 50% ownership interest in DEFS. Approximately $20 billion of assets, $13 billion of liabilities (which includes approximately $8.6 billion of debt issued by Spectra Energy Capital and its consolidated subsidiaries) and $7 billion of common stockholders equity were distributed from Duke Energy as of the date of the spin off. Assets and liabilities of entities included in the spin off of Spectra Energy were transferred from Duke Energy on a historical cost basis on the date of the spin off transaction. As a result of the spin off transaction, on January 2, 2007, in lieu of adjusting the conversion ratio of the convertible debt, Duke Energy issued approximately 2.4 million shares of Spectra Energy common stock to holders of Duke Energys convertible senior notes due 2023, consistent with the terms of the debt agreements. The issuance of Spectra Energy shares to the convertible debt holders is expected to result in a pretax charge in the range of $20 million to $30 million in Duke Energys 2007 consolidated statement of operations. The historical results of the natural gas businesses are expected to be treated as discontinued operations at Duke Energy in future periods beginning with the first quarter of 2007. The primary businesses remaining in Duke Energy post spin are the U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas business segment, the Commercial Power business segment, the International Energy business segment and Duke Energys effective 50% interest in the Crescent JV. The decision to spin off the natural gas business is expected to deliver long term value to shareholders. Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 was signed into law in August 2005. The legislation directs specified agencies to conduct a significant number of studies on various aspects of the energy industry and to implement other provisions through rulemakings. Among the key provisions, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 repeals the PUHCA of 1935, directs FERC to establish a self regulating electric reliability organization governed by an independent board with FERC oversight, extends the Price Anderson Act for 20 years (until 2025), provides loan guarantees, standby support and production tax credits for new nuclear reactors, gives FERC enhanced merger approval authority, provides FERC new backstop authority for the siting of certain electric transmission projects, streamlines the processes for approval and permitting of interstate pipelines, and reforms hydropower relicensing. FERCs enhanced merger authority will not apply to transactions pending with the FERC as of August 8, 2005, such as the Duke Energy and Cinergy merger, as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions and Dispositions. In late 2005 and early 2006, FERC initiated several rulemakings as directed by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Duke Energy is currently evaluating these proposals and does not anticipate that these rulemakings will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Global Climate Change. The greenhouse gas policy of the United States currently favors voluntary actions to reduce emissions and continued research and technology development over near term mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements. Although several bills have been introduced in Congress that would mandate greenhouse gas emission reductions, none have advanced through the legislature and presently there are no federal mandatory greenhouse gas reduction requirements. While it is possible that Congress will adopt some form of mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction legislation in the future, the timing and specific requirements of any such legislation are highly uncertain. Several Northeastern states and California are in the process of developing their own mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction programs; none of which will impact Duke Energys operations. Duke Energy supports the enactment of U.S. federal legislation that would require a gradual transition to a lower carbon intensive economy. Legislation preferably would be in the form of a federal level carbon tax or cap and trade based program. Duke Energy, believing that it is in the best interest of its investors and customers to do so, is actively participating in the evolution of federal policy on this important issue. Duke Energys proactive role in climate change policy debates in the United States does not change the uncertainty around such policy. Due to the speculative outlook regarding U.S. federal policy, Duke Energy cannot estimate the potential effect of future U.S. greenhouse gas policy on its future consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Duke Energy will assess and respond to the potential implications of U.S. greenhouse gas policy for its business operations if policy becomes sufficiently developed and certain to support a meaningful assessment. 83 Table of Contents PART II This disclosure related to the global climate change excludes developments in Canada due to the spin off of Duke Energys natural gas businesses on January 2, 2007. (For additional information on other issues related to Duke Energy, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies.) New Accounting Standards The following new accounting standards have been issued, but have not yet been adopted by Duke Energy as of December 31, 2006: SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140 (SFAS No. 155). In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, which amends SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities (SFAS No. 140). SFAS No. 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for at fair value at acquisition, at issuance, or when a previously recognized financial instrument is subject to a remeasurement (new basis) event, on an instrument by instrument basis, in cases in which a derivative would otherwise have to be bifurcated. SFAS No. 155 is effective for Duke Energy for all financial instruments acquired, issued, or subject to remeasurement after January 1, 2007, and for certain hybrid financial instruments that have been bifurcated prior to the effective date, for which the effect is to be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Duke Energy does not anticipate the adoption of SFAS No. 155 will have any material impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS No. 156). In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, which amends SFAS No. 140. SFAS No. 156 requires recognition of a servicing asset or liability when an entity enters into arrangements to service financial instruments in certain situations. Such servicing assets or servicing liabilities are required to be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. SFAS No. 156 also allows an entity to subsequently measure its servicing assets or servicing liabilities using either an amortization method or a fair value method. SFAS No. 156 is effective for Duke Energy as of January 1, 2007, and must be applied prospectively, except that where an entity elects to remeasure separately recognized existing arrangements and reclassify certain available for sale securities to trading securities, any effects must be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. Duke Energy does not anticipate the adoption of SFAS No. 156 will have any material impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. However, in some cases, the application of SFAS No. 157 may change Duke Energys current practice for measuring and disclosing fair values under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. For Duke Energy, SFAS No. 157 is effective as of January 1, 2008 and must be applied prospectively except in certain cases. Duke Energy is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 157, and cannot currently estimate the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. For Duke Energy, SFAS No. 159 is effective as of January 1, 2008 and will have no impact on amounts presented for periods prior to the effective date. Duke Energy cannot currently estimate the impact of SFAS No. 159 on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position and has not yet determined whether or not it will choose to measure items subject to SFAS No. 159 at fair value. FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which provides guidance on accounting for income tax positions about which Duke Energy has concluded there is a level of uncertainty with respect to the recognition in Duke Energys financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet. Tax positions are defined very broadly and include not only tax deductions and credits but also decisions not to file in a particular jurisdiction, as well as the taxability of transactions. Duke Energy will implement FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. The implementation is expected to result in a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning Retained Earnings on the Consolidated Statement of Common Stockholders Equity and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the first quarter 2007 in the range of $15 million to $30 million. Corresponding entries will impact a variety of balance sheet line items, including Deferred Income Taxes, Taxes Accrued, Other Liabilities, and Goodwill. Upon implementation of FIN 48, Duke Energy will reflect interest expense related to taxes as Interest Expense, in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, subsequent accounting for FIN 48 (after January 1, 2007) will involve an evaluation to determine if any changes have occurred that would impact the existing uncertain tax positions as well as 84 Table of Contents PART II determining whether any new tax positions are uncertain. Any impacts resulting from the evaluation of existing uncertain tax positions or from the recognition of new uncertain tax positions would impact income tax expense and interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, with offsetting impacts to the balance sheet line items described above. Because of the spin off of Spectra Energy in the first quarter of 2007, certain liabilities and deferred tax assets related to uncertain tax positions filed on Spectra Energy tax returns will be removed from Duke Energys balance sheet. Uncertain tax positions on consolidated or combined tax returns filed by Duke Energy which are indemnified by Spectra Energy will be recorded as receivables from Spectra Energy. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 123(R) 5, Amendment of FASB Staff Position FAS 123(R) 1 (FSP No. FAS 123(R) 5). In October 2006, the FASB staff issued FSP No. FAS 123(R) 5 to address whether a modification of an instrument in connection with an equity restructuring should be considered a modification for purposes of applying FSP No. FAS 123(R) 1, Classification and Measurement of Freestanding Financial Instruments Originally Issued in Exchange for Employee Services under FASB Statement No. 123(R) (FSP No. FAS 123(R) 1). In August 2005, the FASB staff issued FSP FAS 123(R) 1 to defer indefinitely the effective date of paragraphs A230 A232 of SFAS No. 123(R), and thereby require entities to apply the recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) throughout the life of an instrument, unless the instrument is modified when the holder is no longer an employee. The recognition and measurement of an instrument that is modified when the holder is no longer an employee should be determined by other applicable generally accepted accounting principles. FSP No. FAS 123(R) 5 addresses modifications of stock based awards made in connection with an equity restructuring and clarifies that for instruments that were originally issued as employee compensation and then modified, and that modification is made to the terms of the instrument solely to reflect an equity restructuring that occurs when the holders are no longer employees, no change in the recognition or the measurement (due to a change in classification) of those instruments will result if certain conditions are met. This FSP is effective for Duke Energy as of January 1, 2007. The impact to Duke Energy of applying FSP No. FAS 123(R) 5 in subsequent periods will be dependent upon the nature of any modifications to Duke Energys share based compensation awards. FSP No. AUG AIR 1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities, (FSP AUG AIR 1). In September 2006, the FASB Staff issued FSP No. AUG AIR 1. This FSP prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in annual and interim financial reporting periods, if no liability is required to be recorded for an asset retirement obligation based on a legal obligation for which the event obligating the entity has occurred. The FSP also requires disclosures regarding the method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities and the effects of implementing the FSP. The guidance in this FSP is effective for Duke Energy as of January 1, 2007 and will be applied and retrospectively for all financial statements presented. Duke Energy does not anticipate the adoption of FSP No. AUG AIR 1 will have any material impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. EITF Issue No. 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation) (EITF No. 06 3). In June 2006, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF No. 06 3 to address any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but are not limited to, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes. For taxes within the issues scope, the consensus requires that entities present such taxes on either a gross (i.e. included in revenues and costs) or net (i.e. exclude from revenues) basis according to their accounting policies, which should be disclosed. If such taxes are reported gross and are significant, entities should disclose the amounts of those taxes. Disclosures may be made on an aggregate basis. The consensus is effective for Duke Energy beginning January 1, 2007. Duke Energy does not anticipate the adoption of EITF No. 06 3 will have any material impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. EITF Issue No. 06 5, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance Determining the Amount That Could Be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85 4 (EITF No. 06 5). In June 2006, the EITF reached a consensus on the accounting for corporate owned and bank owned life insurance policies. EITF No. 06 5 requires that a policyholder consider the cash surrender value and any additional amounts to be received under the contractual terms of the policy in determining the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract. Amounts that are recoverable by the policyholder at the discretion of the insurance company must be excluded from the amount that could be realized. Fixed amounts that are recoverable by the policyholder in future periods in excess of one year from the surrender of the policy must be recognized at their present value. EITF No. 06 5 is effective for Duke Energy as of January 1, 2007 and must be applied as a change in accounting principle through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings or other components of equity as of January 1, 2007. Duke Energy does not anticipate the adoption of EITF No. 06 5 will have any material impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. EITF Issue No. 06 6, Debtors Accounting for a Modification (or Exchange) of Convertible Debt Instruments (EITF No. 06 6). In November 2006, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF No. 06 6. EITF No. 06 6 addresses how a modification of a debt instrument (or 85 Table of Contents PART II an exchange of debt instruments) that affects the terms of an embedded conversion option should be considered in the issuers analysis of whether debt extinguishment accounting should be applied, and further addresses the accounting for a modification of a debt instrument (or an exchange of debt instruments) that affects the terms of an embedded conversion option when extinguishment accounting is not applied. EITF No. 06 6 applies to modifications (or exchanges) occurring in interim or annual reporting periods beginning after November 29, 2006, regardless of when the instrument was originally issued. Early application is permitted for modifications (or exchanges) occurring in periods for which financial statements have not been issued. There were no modifications to, or exchanges of, any of Duke Energys debt instruments within the scope of EITF No. 06 6 in 2006. EITF No. 06 6 is effective for Duke Energy beginning January 1, 2007. The impact to Duke Energy of applying EITF No. 06 6 in subsequent periods will be dependent upon the nature of any modifications to, or exchanges of, any debt instruments within the scope of EITF No. 06 6.
