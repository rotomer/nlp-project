Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 20 Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The following table presents selected consolidated financial and operating data for the periods indicated. The following financial and operating data should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this report. Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 (in thousands, except per share) Income statement data: Net operating revenues(1) $ 1,650,753 $ 1,486,302 $ 1,445,351 $ 1,203,738 $ 758,403 Total operating expenses(2) 1,332,761 1,311,587 1,509,333 1,068,825 646,816 Operating income (loss) 317,992 174,715 (63,982 ) 134,913 111,587 Other income (loss) 4,644 (7,201 ) (1,895 ) 4,894 3,175 Debt expense(3) 72,438 116,637 110,797 84,003 29,082 Minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries (9,260 ) (5,942 ) (5,152 ) (7,163 ) (4,502 ) Income (loss) before income taxes, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 240,938 44,935 (181,826 ) 48,641 81,178 Income tax expense (benefit) 104,600 27,960 (34,570 ) 38,449 35,654 Income (loss) before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ 136,338 $ 16,975 $ (147,256 ) $ 10,192 $ 45,524 Net income (loss)(4) $ 137,315 $ 13,485 $ (147,256 ) $ (9,448 ) $ 45,524 Basic earnings (loss) per common share: Income (loss) before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ 1.63 $ 0.21 $ (1.81 ) $ 0.12 $ 0.59 Net income (loss)(4) $ 1.64 $ 0.17 $ (1.81 ) $ (0.12 ) $ 0.59 Diluted earnings (loss) per common share: Income (loss) before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ 1.51 $ 0.20 $ (1.81 ) $ 0.12 $ 0.57 Net income (loss)(4) $ 1.52 $ 0.16 $ (1.81 ) $ (0.12 ) $ 0.57 Ratio of earnings to fixed charges(5)(6) 3.63:1 1.32:1 See (6) 1.49:1 3.12:1 Balance sheet data: Working capital(7) $ 175,983 $ 148,348 $ (1,043,796 ) $ 388,064 $ 205,798 Total assets 1,662,683 1,596,632 2,056,718 1,911,619 1,279,261 Long term debt(8) 811,190 974,006 5,696 1,225,781 731,192 Shareholders equity 503,637 349,368 326,404 473,864 422,446 (1) Net operating revenues in 2001 include $22,000 of prior period services revenue relating to cash settlements and collections in excess of prior estimates. (2) Total operating expenses include expense offsets from recoveries of $35,220 in 2001 of accounts receivable reserved in 1999, impairments and valuation losses of $4,556 in 2000 and $139,805 in 1999, and merger related costs of $78,188 in 1998. 21 (3) Debt expense includes a write off of deferred financing costs of $1,192 in 2000 and $1,601 in 1999, and a loss on termination of interest rate swap agreements related to refinanced debt of $9,823 in 1998. (4) Extraordinary items include a gain of $977 ($0.01 per share) in 2001 relating to the write off of deferred financing costs and the associated accelerated swap liquidation gains resulting from debt refinancing, and losses associated with early extinguishment of debt of $3,490 ($0.04 per share) in 2000 and $12,744 ($0.16 per share) in 1998. In 1998 we adopted AICPA Statement of Position No. 98 5, Reporting on the Costs for Start up Activities, or SOP 98 5, which requires that pre opening and organization costs be expensed as incurred. As a result, unamortized deferred pre opening and organizational costs of $6,896 ($0.08 per share) were written off as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in 1998. (5) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is computed by dividing earnings by fixed charges. Earnings for this purpose is defined as pretax income from continuing operations adjusted by adding fixed charges other than interest capitalized during the period. Fixed charges is defined as the total of interest expense, amortization of financing costs, capitalized interest and the estimated interest component of rental expense on operating leases. (6) Due to our loss in 1999, the ratio coverage in 1999 was less than 1:1. We would have had to generate additional earnings of $182,535 to achieve a coverage of 1:1. (7) The working capital calculation as of December 31, 1999 includes long term debt that was potentially callable under covenant provisions of $1,425,610. (8) Long term debt as of December 31, 1999 excludes $1,425,610 that was potentially callable under covenant provisions. 22 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, and the risk factors set forth in this Form 10 K. These risks, among others, include those relating to possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private and indemnity patients and from ancillary services including the administration of pharmaceuticals, the ongoing payment suspension and review of the Companys Florida laboratory subsidiary by its Medicare carrier and the Department of Justice, the ongoing review by the Civil Division of the US Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Companys ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in our forward looking statements. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we have no current intention to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Prior to mid 1999, the company had an aggressive growth strategy of acquiring other dialysis businesses. This rapid growth through acquisitions had a significant impact on administrative functions and operating efficiencies. In October 1999, Kent Thiry was named our chairman and chief executive officer, and we initiated a turnaround plan focused on improving our financial and operational infrastructure. During 2000, we divested substantially all of our operations outside the continental United States, made significant improvements in our billing and collecting operations, reduced our debt and restructured our credit facilities. We achieved further improvements in operating systems and processes during 2001, and we will be making significant investments in new systems and processes in 2002. Results of operations Continental U.S. and non continental U.S. operating revenues and operating expenses were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (dollars in millions) Operating revenues: Continental U.S. $ 1,636 99 % $ 1,412 95 % $ 1,321 91 % Non continental U.S. 15 1 % 74 5 % 124 9 % $ 1,651 100 % $ 1,486 100 % $ 1,445 100 % Operating expenses: Continental U.S. $ 1,317 99 % $ 1,234 94 % $ 1,243 83 % Non continental U.S. 16 1 % 73 6 % 126 8 % Impairment and merger costs 4 140 9 % $ 1,333 100 % $ 1,311 100 % $ 1,509 100 % Because all operations outside the continental United States have been divested with the exception of the pending completion of the sale of two centers in Puerto Rico, the non continental U.S. operating results are excluded from the revenue and cost trends discussed below. 23 Operating results excluding the non continental U.S. operations were as follows (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for non continental U.S. operating results): Continental U.S. Operations Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (dollars in millions) Operating revenues (excluding $22 million of prior period services revenue in 2001) $ 1,614 100 % $ 1,412 100 % $ 1,321 100 % Operating expenses: Dialysis centers and labs 1,087 67 % 973 69 % 893 68 % General and administrative 129 8 % 120 8 % 124 9 % Depreciation and amortization 104 6 % 103 7 % 99 7 % Provision for uncollectible accounts (excluding $35 million of recoveries in 2001 of amounts reserved in 1999) 32 2 % 38 3 % 127 10 % 1,352 84 % 1,234 87 % 1,243 94 % Operating income (excluding impairment losses, recoveries and prior period services revenue) $ 262 16 % $ 178 13 % $ 78 6 % Impairments and valuation losses/(gains): Non continental U.S. operations $ 1 $ (1 ) $ 83 Continental U.S. operations (1 ) 5 57 $ $ 4 $ 140 Dialysis treatments (000s) 5,690 5,354 5,139 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 278 $ 256 $ 246 Dialysis services revenue represented 98%, 97% and 96% of total operating revenues in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Lab, other and management fee income account for the balance of revenues. Dialysis services. Dialysis services include outpatient center hemodialysis, which accounts for approximately 87% of total dialysis treatments, home dialysis, and inpatient hemodialysis with contracted hospitals. Major components of dialysis revenue include the administration of EPO, which represents approximately 25% of operating revenues, and other drugs which are administered as part of the dialysis treatment. Dialysis services are paid for primarily by Medicare and state Medicaid programs in accordance with rates established by CMS, and by other third party payors such as HMOs and health insurance carriers. Services provided to patients covered by third party insurance companies are normally reimbursed at rates higher than Medicare or Medicaid rates. Patients covered by employer group health plans convert to Medicare after a maximum of 33 months. As of year end 2001, the Medicare ESRD composite rates were between $121 and $144 per treatment, with an overall average of $131 per treatment. The majority of earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated reimbursement rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary rates. The commercial reimbursement rates are under continual pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the reimbursement rates generally decline substantially. 24 Dialysis services revenues by payor type were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Percent of total dialysis revenue: Medicare 52 % 53 % 54 % Medicaid 5 5 5 57 58 59 Commercial and other 43 42 41 100 % 100 % 100 % The number of equivalent hemodialysis treatments associated with the continental U.S. operations totaled approximately 5.7 million, 5.4 million and 5.1 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. The increase in the number of treatments accounted for approximately 40% and 50% of the total growth in dialysis services revenue for 2001 and 2000 respectively. The treatment volume growth in both 2001 and in 2000 was principally associated with same center growth. The treatment growth rate for centers in place for at least one year was approximately 4% for 2001 and 3% for 2000. Approximately 60% and 50% of the increase in dialysis services revenue for 2001 and 2000 was attributable to increases in the average reimbursement rate per treatment. The average revenue recognized per hemodialysis treatment (excluding any prior period services revenue) was $278, $256 and $246 for 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. The substantial increase in 2001 was principally due to continued improvements in revenue realization due to improved clinical operations and billing and collection processes, and a 2.4% increase in the Medicare composite reimbursement rates. The increase in 2000 was principally attributable to the availability of new improved pharmaceuticals and related changes in physician practice patterns which led to the administration of two new higher cost drugs, and a 1.2% increase in Medicare reimbursement rates. The average reimbursement rate for the fourth quarter of 2001 was approximately $283 compared with approximately $280 for the third quarter and $275 for the first half of 2001. Net operating revenues for 2001 included $22 million of cash settlements and collections in excess of our prior estimates for 2000 net revenue. These cash recoveries associated with the prior years services resulted from continued improvements in our billing and collecting operations. Although we continue to pursue collection of aged accounts, we cannot predict the timing or amount of further incremental recoveries or settlements. Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with predicting third party reimbursements in the healthcare industry, our revenue recognition involves significant estimating risks. Such risks and uncertainties are addressed in the AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1, Auditing Health Care Third Party Revenues and Related Receivables. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgement as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the date of the reporting period. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Lab and other services. The discussion regarding contingencies below further addresses revenue recognition uncertainties associated with our Florida laboratory. Because of the unresolved dispute with the third party carrier for Medicare reimbursement claims, we have received no payments for more than three years. During 2000 we discontinued recognizing all Medicare revenue associated with the Florida laboratory until the uncertainties regarding both the timing of resolution and the ultimate revenue valuations are at least substantially eliminated. Although it is impossible to reliably predict the ultimate outcome, we believe it is reasonably possible that the ultimate settlement of this dispute, which may be several years away, could result in substantial recoveries to the Company. Laboratory Medicare billings not recognized as revenue beginning in 2000 because of the third party carrier disputes and the ongoing withhold of payments amount to approximately $5 million per 25 quarter. During 2001, we combined the operations of a second clinical laboratory with our clinical laboratory in Florida. Management fee income. Management fee income represented less than 1% of total revenues for 2001 and 2000. The management fees are established by contract and are typically based on a percentage of revenue of the managed center. As of December 31, 2001, we managed 25 third party dialysis centers utilizing our existing infrastructure. We acquired sixteen previously managed centers during 2001. Dialysis centers and lab expenses. Operating expenses consist of cost and expenses specifically attributable to the operations of dialysis centers and labs, including direct labor, drugs, medical supplies and other patient care service costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of dialysis, lab and pharmacy services, excluding prior period services revenue and non continental U.S. operations, were 67%, 69% and 68% for 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. These costs increased on a per treatment basis from $182 in 2000 to $191 in 2001. This increase was principally due to higher labor and drug costs, which were more than offset by efficiencies in delivering patient treatments as well as increased revenue per treatment. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and labs, and include expenses for corporate and regional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues, excluding non continental U.S. operations and prior period services revenue, were 8.0%, 8.5% and 9.4% for 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. The decline in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for 2001 was due to the increase in revenue being proportionately greater than the 7.5% increase in expenses. The increase in the dollar amount of general and administrative spending in 2001 was primarily related to labor costs. The lower general and administrative expense percentage in 2000 as compared to 1999 was also primarily attributable to the increase in revenue, while the dollar amount of general and administrative expenses declined by $4 million. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. Before considering cash recoveries, the provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately 2% of operating revenues, compared with approximately 3% and 10% for 2000 and 1999. The decrease in the provision resulted from the improvements that were made in billing and collecting processes. During 2001, we realized recoveries of $35 million associated with aged accounts receivables that had been reserved in 1999. The recoveries were a result of our improved collections processes implemented over the past two years. The provision for 2001, net of those recoveries, was a net recovery of $3 million. The high level of provision for uncollectible accounts in 1999 resulted from the Companys inability to achieve its projected cash collection trends during 1999. The rapid growth through acquisitions and the merger with RTC in 1998 had a significant impact on administrative functions, including billing and cash collection processes. The backlog of aged accounts receivable continued to increase during the first half of 1999 due to high turnover of billing and collection personnel and process inefficiencies. The build up of the backlog of aged accounts not processed on a timely basis created collection difficulties at a level not previously experienced, resulting in the unusually high write offs in 1999. Impairment and valuation adjustments. In 1999, we incurred impairment charges of $83 million relating to the sale of our dialysis operations outside the continental United States. We also incurred impairment and valuation losses of $57 million in 1999 associated with the closure of certain dialysis centers within the United States and other investments and loan impairments. The impairment losses were determined based upon estimated net realizable values principally associated with leasehold improvements, loans, investments, intangible assets and future projections of cash flows specific to each center. Additional net charges of $4 million were incurred in 2000. 26 Our policy is to perform impairment reviews for our investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses whenever a change in condition occurs, including changes in our business strategy and plans, or when the third party dialysis business experiences deteriorating operating performance or liquidity problems. With regard to the potential impairment of goodwill balances, we routinely review cash flows associated with the goodwill balances. Debt expense Debt expense for 2001, 2000 and 1999 consisted of interest expense of approximately $70, $113 and $107 million respectively, and the amortization and write off of deferred financing costs of approximately $3 million in 2001, and $4 million in both 2000 and 1999. The decrease in interest expense in 2001 resulted from lower debt balances as well as interest rate reductions. Other income (loss) The net of other income and loss items was income of $4.6 million for 2001 and losses of $7.2 million and $1.9 million for 2000 and 1999. Included in other income (loss) was interest income of $3.2 million, $7.7 million and $4.8 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In 2000, we also had losses of $10.8 million and $4.7 million related to the settlement of a stockholder class action lawsuit and the recognition of the foreign currency translation loss associated with the divestitures of the non continental U.S. operations. The foreign currency translation loss had previously been recognized in comprehensive income. In 1999, equity investment and other non operating losses more than offset interest income. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2001 represented an effective tax rate of 43.4%, compared with approximately 62% in 2000. The high effective rate in 2000 resulted from the relatively low level of pre tax earnings in relation to permanent differences, such as non deductible amortization, deferred tax valuation allowances associated with the sale of non continental U.S. operations and the cancellation of medical director stock options. The provision for income taxes for 1999 was a tax benefit (negative expense) of $35 million, reflecting current and deferred tax benefits resulting from the 1999 pre tax loss. The 1999 tax benefit was reduced by a deferred tax asset valuation allowance for impairment and valuation losses that are capital in nature. For tax purposes, such losses may only be offset against capital gains within a limited carryback and carryforward period. Due to our limited ability to generate capital gains from operations, a tax benefit has not been recorded for these losses. Extraordinary items In 2001, the extraordinary gain of $1 million, net of tax, related to the write off of deferred financing costs offset by the accelerated recognition of deferred interest rate swap liquidation gains as a result of debt refinancing. In 2000, the extraordinary loss of $3.5 million, net of tax, related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with an early extinguishment of debt. In July 2000, we restructured our revolving and term credit facilities. Projections for 2002 Based on current conditions and recent experience, our current projections for 2002 are for normal operating earnings before depreciation and amortization, debt expense and taxes to be in the range of $350 million to $380 27 million. These projections assume minimal acquisitions, an internal annual growth rate of the number of dialysis treatments of approximately 3% 4%, no significant unanticipated changes in pharmaceutical related revenues resulting from procedural, vendor or physician practice pattern changes, and underlying cost growth trends consistent with recent years, with additional substantial investments in our core processes and training planned for 2002. These and other underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. Additionally, the renegotiation or restructuring of unfavorable managed care contracts, medical director agreements or other arrangements may result in future impairment or other charges. We undertake no duty to update these projections, whether due to changes in current or expected trends, underlying market conditions, decisions of the United States Attorneys Office, the DOJ or HHS in any pending or future review of our business, or otherwise. Significant new accounting standard for 2002 In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, including any such intangibles recorded in past business combinations, will not be amortized beginning January 1, 2002. In addition, intangible assets such as patient charts that are neither contractual nor separable under the criteria of SFAS No. 142 will be included as goodwill. SFAS No. 142 specifies that there was to be no amortization recorded for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets resulting from business combinations completed during the last six months of 2001. SFAS No. 142 also requires the assets to be written down with a goodwill impairment charge against current earnings whenever the recorded values exceed their fair values. If this standard had been implemented as of January 1, 2001, amortization expense would have been reduced by $42 million, or $25 million net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2001 and net income and diluted earnings per share would have been approximately $162 million and $1.75 per share. Liquidity and capital resources Cash flow from operations during 2001 amounted to $273 million. Non operating cash flows included $67 million for acquisitions, net of divestitures, (before offsets of $25 million related to reductions in investments in third party dialysis businesses and related advances) and $51 million in capital asset expenditures. During 2000, operating cash flows amounted to $308 million, and divestitures, net of acquisitions, generated an additional $134 million. Capital asset expenditures were $41 million in 2000. During the second quarter of 2001 we issued $225 million of 9% Senior Subordinated Notes and completed a refinancing of our senior credit facilities. The net proceeds of these transactions were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our then existing senior credit facilities. The new senior credit facilities consist of two term loans (totaling $114 million as of December 31, 2001) and a $150 million revolving credit facility (undrawn at December 31, 2001). Total outstanding debt amounted to $820 million at December 31, 2001. Debt, net of cash, amounted to $784 million at December 31, 2001, a reduction of $162 million during the year. In 2000, we negotiated a major restructure of the credit facility and we were able to reduce the total outstanding debt by over $482 million from our operating cash flows and the proceeds from divesting our non continental operations. The continental U.S. accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2001 and 2000 represented approximately 72 and 73 days of net revenue, net of bad debt provision. In November 2001, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our stock over an eighteen month period. As of January 31, 2002, we had repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares for a total cost of approximately $70 million. Our current plans call for a significant increase in capital expenditures over the next year, including significant investment expenditures for information technology systems and for new dialysis centers, relocations 28 and expansions. During 2001, we acquired a total of 21 centers and we opened 7 new centers. We previously managed 16 of the acquired centers, and one of the newly opened centers in 2001 is an unconsolidated center under our management in which we own a minority interest. In addition to the debt obligations reflected in our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. The Company has contingent obligations to purchase the minority interests in several of its joint ventures. These obligations are in the form of put options, exercisable at the minority owners discretion, and require the Company to purchase the minority owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of cash flow. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2001 (000s): Within One Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years  Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 9,034 $ 21,221 $ 217,030 $ 572,939 $ 820,224 Operating leases 47,958 87,643 72,817 98,457 306,875 $ 56,992 $ 108,864 $ 289,847 $ 671,396 $ 1,127,099 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 12,000 $ 12,000 Acquisition of dialysis centers 30,000 $ 4,000 $ 18,000 $ 8,000 60,000 $ 42,000 $ 4,000 $ 18,000 $ 8,000 $ 72,000 We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations over the next twelve months. Contingencies Health care provider revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; and (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements. Our Florida based laboratory subsidiary is the subject of a third party carrier review of its Medicare reimbursement claims. The carrier has issued formal overpayment determinations in the amount of $5.6 million for the review period from January 1995 to April 1996 and $15 million for the review period from May 1996 to March 1998. The carrier has suspended all payments of Medicare claims from this laboratory since May 1998. The carrier also has determined that $16.1 million of the suspended claims for the review period from April 1998 to August 1999 and $11.6 million of the suspended claims for the review period from August 1999 to May 2000 were not properly supported by the prescribing physicians medical justification. The carrier has alleged that approximately 99% of the tests the laboratory performed during the review period from January 1995 to April 1996, 96% of the tests performed in the period from May 1996 to March 1998, 70% of the tests performed in the period from April 1998 to August 1999, and 72% of the tests performed in the period from August 1999 to May 2000 were not properly supported by the prescribing physicians medical justification. We are disputing the overpayment determinations and have provided supporting documentation of our claims. We have initiated the process of a formal review of each of the carriers determinations. The first step in 29 this formal review process is a hearing before a hearing officer at the carrier. The hearing regarding the initial review period from January 1995 to April 1996 was held in July 1999. In January 2000, the hearing officer issued a decision upholding the overpayment determination of $5.6 million. The hearing regarding the second review period from May 1996 to March 1998 was held in April 2000. In July 2000, the hearing officer issued a decision upholding $14.2 million, or substantially all of the overpayment determination. We filed a consolidated appeal of both decisions to a federal administrative law judge. The appeal was divided into two separate hearings. The first of which took place in January 2002, addressed the validity of the two statistical samples the carrier used to support its determinations. We are awaiting the judges decision. The second hearing will address the carriers determinations on the individual claims in the two samples. The administrative law judge has informed us that we can expect the second hearing to occur in the second quarter of 2002. In addition to the formal appeal process with a federal administrative law judge, beginning in the third quarter of 1999 we sought a meeting with the Department of Justice, or DOJ, to begin a process to resolve this matter. The carrier had previously informed the local office of the DOJ and HHS of this matter and we had provided requested information to the DOJ. We met with the DOJ in February 2001, at which time the DOJ requested additional information, which we have provided. Our discussions with the DOJ are ongoing. The timing of the final resolution of this matter is highly uncertain and beyond our control or influence. During 2000, we stopped accruing additional Medicare revenue from this laboratory until the uncertainties regarding both the timing of resolution and the ultimate revenue valuations are at least substantially eliminated. Laboratory Medicare billings not recognized as revenue beginning in 2000 because of the third party carrier disputes and the ongoing withhold of payments amount to approximately $5 million per quarter. We estimate that the potential cash exposure as of December 31, 2001 was not more than $10 million based on the carriers overpayment findings noted above. In addition, the government could impose additional fines and penalties, which could be substantial. At this time we are unable to determine: When this matter will be resolved or when the laboratorys payment suspension will be lifted; The amount of the laboratory claims for which we may be paid; What action the carrier, the DOJ or HHS may take with respect to this matter; Whether the carrier may review additional periods beyond the four identified; and Any outcome of this review, financial or otherwise. An adverse determination could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Medicare carrier for our Minnesota laboratory is conducting a post payment review of Medicare reimbursement claims for the period January 1996 through December 1999. The scope of the review is similar to the review being conducted at our Florida laboratory. At this time, we are unable to determine at this time how long it will take the carrier to complete this review. There is currently no overpayment determination or payment suspension with respect to the Minnesota laboratory. The DOJ has also requested information with respect to this laboratory, which we have provided. Medicare revenues at the Minnesota laboratory, which is much smaller than the Florida laboratory, were approximately $15 million for the period under review. In November 2001, we closed the Minnesota laboratory and combined the operations of this laboratory with our Florida laboratory. In February 2001, the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of the Companys historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and its financial relationships with physicians. The Civil Division has requested that we provide a wide range of information responding to the areas of review. The Civil Division has not initiated any legal process or served any subpoena on us. The Civil Division has indicated that it is not making any allegation of wrongdoing at this time and that no criminal action against us or any 30 individual is contemplated. We are cooperating in this review. The inquiry appears to be at an early stage. As it proceeds, the Civil Division could expand its areas of concern. If a court determines there has been wrongdoing, the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial. In addition to the foregoing, DaVita is subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these additional matters, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 31 RISK FACTORS This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, earnings before depreciation and amortization, debt expense and taxes, and capital expenditures. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we do not intend to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment in which we operate, competitive activities and other business conditions. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include those set forth below. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. If the percentage of our patients paying at or near our list prices declines, then our revenues, cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced. Approximately 43%, 42% and 41% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, were generated from patients who had private payors as the primary payor. A minority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at or near our list prices, which are significantly higher than Medicare rates. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at rates that are below our list prices but, in most cases, higher than Medicare rates. We believe that pressure from private payors to decrease the rates they pay us may increase. If the percentage of patients who have insurance that pays us at or near our list prices decreases significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and earnings. If we are unable to renegotiate material contracts with managed care plans on acceptable terms, we may experience a decline in same center growth. We have contracts with some large managed care plans that include unfavorable terms. Although we are attempting to renegotiate the terms of these contracts, we cannot predict whether we will reach agreement on new terms or whether we will renew these contracts. As a result, we may lose numerous patients of these managed care plans and experience a decline in our same center growth, which would negatively impact our revenues. Future declines, or the lack of further increases, in Medicare reimbursement rates would reduce our net income and cash flows. Approximately 52%, 53%, and 54% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, were generated from patients who had Medicare as their primary payor. The Medicare ESRD program reimburses us for dialysis and ancillary services at fixed rates. Unlike many other Medicare programs, the Medicare ESRD program does not provide for periodic inflation increases in reimbursement rates. These rates have declined over 70% in real dollars since 1972. Increases of 1.2% in 2000 and 2.4% in 2001 were the first increases in the composite rate since 1991, and were significantly less than the cumulative rate of inflation since 1991. There has been no increase to the composite rate for 2002. Increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, have occurred and are expected to continue to occur without a compensating increase in reimbursement rates. We cannot predict the nature or extent of future rate changes, if any. To the extent these rates are not adjusted to keep pace with inflation, our net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. 32 Future changes in the structure of, and reimbursement rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our operating earnings and cash flows. In legislation enacted in December 2000, Congress mandated government studies on whether: The Medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include an annual inflation increase study due July 2002; The Medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include additional services, such as laboratory and other diagnostic tests and the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals, in the composite rate study due July 2002; and Reimbursement for many outpatient prescription drugs that we administer to dialysis patients should be reduced from the current rate of 95% of the average wholesale price. This study was completed; the resulting recommendations exclude most drugs administered during dialysis, but Congress has yet to act on these recommendations. If Medicare began to include in its composite reimbursement rate any ancillary services that it currently reimburses separately, our revenue would decrease to the extent there was not a corresponding increase in that composite rate. In particular, Medicare revenue from EPO was approximately 25% of our total Medicare revenue in 2001, 2000 and 1999. If EPO were included in the composite rate, and if the composite rate were not increased sufficiently, our operating earnings and cash flows could decrease substantially. Reductions in current reimbursement rates for EPO or other outpatient prescription drugs would also reduce our net earnings and cash flows. If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, our revenue and earnings would decline. If a significant number of physicians stop referring patients to our centers, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical directors of the centers. As a result, the primary referral source for our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center. If a medical director agreement terminates, whether before or at the end of its term, it may negatively impact the former medical directors decision to treat his or her patients at our centers. Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally five to ten years. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us. As of December 31, 2001, the agreements with medical directors at 42 centers required renewal on or before December 31, 2002. This includes agreements with terms expiring on or before December 31, 2002 and those with automatic renewal terms that will expire on or before December 31, 2002 if we or the medical director elect not to renew the agreement. In 2001, we renewed agreements with medical directors at 16 centers, and were unable to renew one medical director agreement covering six centers. We have engaged replacement medical directors at these six centers, and the former medical director group is competing with us in a joint venture with another dialysis provider. We also may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships in order to assure compliance with anti kickback and similar laws. These actions could negatively impact physicians decisions to extend their medical director agreements with us. For example, we have recalled stock options and we require monthly statements from our medical directors certifying that they have performed their contractual obligations. To our knowledge, we are the only major dialysis provider to have done this. In addition, if the terms of an existing agreement were found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship, which could lead to the early termination of the agreement. 33 If the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel or our high level of personnel turnover continues, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses. We are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. This shortage limits our ability to expand our operations. We also have a high personnel turnover rate in our dialysis centers. Turnover has been the highest among our reuse technicians, patient care technicians, nurses and unit secretaries. Recent efforts to reduce this turnover may not succeed. If we are not successful, or if we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, our operations and our same center growth will be negatively impacted. Adverse developments with respect to EPO could materially reduce our net income and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients. Amgen is the sole supplier of EPO and may unilaterally decide to increase its price for EPO at any time. For example, Amgen unilaterally increased its base price for EPO by 3.9% in both 2001 and 2000. Also, we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the same discount structure for EPO that we currently receive, or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of discounts within that structure as we have historically achieved. In addition, Amgen has developed a new product, NESP, that may replace EPO or reduce its use with dialysis patients. We cannot predict if or when NESP will be introduced to the U.S. dialysis market, nor what its cost and reimbursement structure will be. Increases in the cost of EPO and the introduction of NESP could have a material adverse effect on our net income and cash flows. Changes in clinical practices and reimbursement rates or rules for EPO and other drugs could substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. The administration of EPO and other drugs accounted for approximately 36%, 35% and 32% of our net operating revenue in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Changes in physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices, changes in private and governmental reimbursement rates and rules, the introduction of new drugs and the conversion to alternate types of administration, for example from intravenous administration to subcutaneous or oral administration, that may also result in lower or less frequent dosages, could reduce our revenues and earnings from the administration of EPO and other drugs. If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations and federal and state anti kickback laws. The regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers, including dialysis providers, has increased significantly in recent years. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, the DOJ announced total recoveries of more than $1.2 billion from healthcare civil fraud cases. In the prior fiscal year, one of our competitors entered into a $486 million settlement as a result of an Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, and DOJ investigation into some of its business practices. In addition, the frequency and intensity of Medicare certification surveys and inspections of dialysis centers has increased markedly since 2000, consistent with recommendations of the OIG. We endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with the anti kickback laws; however, the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations. In addition, our historic dependence on manual processes that vary widely across our network of dialysis centers exposes us to greater risk of errors in billing and other business processes. If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations, we could suffer severe consequences, including: Mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses; 34 Suspension of payments from government reimbursement programs; Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable reimbursement program requirements; Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government reimbursement programs, such as the Medicare ESRD program and Medicaid programs; Loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate; and Fines or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations, submission of false claims or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements. The pending federal review of some of our historical practices and third party carrier review of our laboratory subsidiary could result in substantial penalties against us. We are voluntarily cooperating with the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in a review of some of our historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians. In addition, our Florida based laboratory subsidiary is the subject of a third party carrier review of claims it has submitted for Medicare reimbursement. All further Medicare payments to this laboratory were suspended in May 1998, and the DOJ is also reviewing the situation. We are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved, whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters, financial or otherwise. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our rollout of new information technology systems will significantly disrupt our billing and collection activity, may not work as planned and could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We are rolling out new information technology systems and new processes in each of our dialysis centers over the next few years. It is likely that this rollout will disrupt our billing and collection activity and may cause other disruptions to our business operations, which may negatively impact our cash flows. Also, the new information systems may not work as planned or improve our billing and collection processes. If they do not, we may have to spend substantial amounts to enhance or replace these systems. Provisions in our charter documents and compensation programs we have adopted may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests. Our charter documents include provisions which may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent, requiring 60 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our Board of Directors and granting our Board of Directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval. In addition, most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control. We have also adopted a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock options, which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. Based on the shares of our common stock outstanding and the market price of our stock on December 31, 2001, these cash bonuses would total approximately $74 million. These compensation programs may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay. We may, in the future, adopt other measures that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing an unsolicited takeover, even if such a change of control were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated stockholders. Furthermore, we may adopt some of these measures without any further vote or action by our stockholders. 35 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

(2) Total operating expenses include expense offsets from recoveries of $35,220 in 2001 of accounts receivable reserved in 1999, impairments and valuation losses of $4,556 in 2000 and $139,805 in 1999, and merger related costs of $78,188 in 1998. 21 (3) Debt expense includes a write off of deferred financing costs of $1,192 in 2000 and $1,601 in 1999, and a loss on termination of interest rate swap agreements related to refinanced debt of $9,823 in 1998. (4) Extraordinary items include a gain of $977 ($0.01 per share) in 2001 relating to the write off of deferred financing costs and the associated accelerated swap liquidation gains resulting from debt refinancing, and losses associated with early extinguishment of debt of $3,490 ($0.04 per share) in 2000 and $12,744 ($0.16 per share) in 1998. In 1998 we adopted AICPA Statement of Position No. 98 5, Reporting on the Costs for Start up Activities, or SOP 98 5, which requires that pre opening and organization costs be expensed as incurred. As a result, unamortized deferred pre opening and organizational costs of $6,896 ($0.08 per share) were written off as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in 1998. (5) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is computed by dividing earnings by fixed charges. Earnings for this purpose is defined as pretax income from continuing operations adjusted by adding fixed charges other than interest capitalized during the period. Fixed charges is defined as the total of interest expense, amortization of financing costs, capitalized interest and the estimated interest component of rental expense on operating leases. (6) Due to our loss in 1999, the ratio coverage in 1999 was less than 1:1. We would have had to generate additional earnings of $182,535 to achieve a coverage of 1:1. (7) The working capital calculation as of December 31, 1999 includes long term debt that was potentially callable under covenant provisions of $1,425,610. (8) Long term debt as of December 31, 1999 excludes $1,425,610 that was potentially callable under covenant provisions. 22 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, and the risk factors set forth in this Form 10 K. These risks, among others, include those relating to possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private and indemnity patients and from ancillary services including the administration of pharmaceuticals, the ongoing payment suspension and review of the Companys Florida laboratory subsidiary by its Medicare carrier and the Department of Justice, the ongoing review by the Civil Division of the US Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Companys ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in our forward looking statements. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we have no current intention to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Prior to mid 1999, the company had an aggressive growth strategy of acquiring other dialysis businesses. This rapid growth through acquisitions had a significant impact on administrative functions and operating efficiencies. In October 1999, Kent Thiry was named our chairman and chief executive officer, and we initiated a turnaround plan focused on improving our financial and operational infrastructure. During 2000, we divested substantially all of our operations outside the continental United States, made significant improvements in our billing and collecting operations, reduced our debt and restructured our credit facilities. We achieved further improvements in operating systems and processes during 2001, and we will be making significant investments in new systems and processes in 2002. Results of operations Continental U.S. and non continental U.S. operating revenues and operating expenses were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (dollars in millions) Operating revenues: Continental U.S. $ 1,636 99 % $ 1,412 95 % $ 1,321 91 % Non continental U.S. 15 1 % 74 5 % 124 9 % $ 1,651 100 % $ 1,486 100 % $ 1,445 100 % Operating expenses: Continental U.S. $ 1,317 99 % $ 1,234 94 % $ 1,243 83 % Non continental U.S. 16 1 % 73 6 % 126 8 % Impairment and merger costs 4 140 9 % $ 1,333 100 % $ 1,311 100 % $ 1,509 100 % Because all operations outside the continental United States have been divested with the exception of the pending completion of the sale of two centers in Puerto Rico, the non continental U.S. operating results are excluded from the revenue and cost trends discussed below. 23 Operating results excluding the non continental U.S. operations were as follows (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for non continental U.S. operating results): Continental U.S. Operations Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (dollars in millions) Operating revenues (excluding $22 million of prior period services revenue in 2001) $ 1,614 100 % $ 1,412 100 % $ 1,321 100 % Operating expenses: Dialysis centers and labs 1,087 67 % 973 69 % 893 68 % General and administrative 129 8 % 120 8 % 124 9 % Depreciation and amortization 104 6 % 103 7 % 99 7 % Provision for uncollectible accounts (excluding $35 million of recoveries in 2001 of amounts reserved in 1999) 32 2 % 38 3 % 127 10 % 1,352 84 % 1,234 87 % 1,243 94 % Operating income (excluding impairment losses, recoveries and prior period services revenue) $ 262 16 % $ 178 13 % $ 78 6 % Impairments and valuation losses/(gains): Non continental U.S. operations $ 1 $ (1 ) $ 83 Continental U.S. operations (1 ) 5 57 $ $ 4 $ 140 Dialysis treatments (000s) 5,690 5,354 5,139 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 278 $ 256 $ 246 Dialysis services revenue represented 98%, 97% and 96% of total operating revenues in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Lab, other and management fee income account for the balance of revenues. Dialysis services. Dialysis services include outpatient center hemodialysis, which accounts for approximately 87% of total dialysis treatments, home dialysis, and inpatient hemodialysis with contracted hospitals. Major components of dialysis revenue include the administration of EPO, which represents approximately 25% of operating revenues, and other drugs which are administered as part of the dialysis treatment. Dialysis services are paid for primarily by Medicare and state Medicaid programs in accordance with rates established by CMS, and by other third party payors such as HMOs and health insurance carriers. Services provided to patients covered by third party insurance companies are normally reimbursed at rates higher than Medicare or Medicaid rates. Patients covered by employer group health plans convert to Medicare after a maximum of 33 months. As of year end 2001, the Medicare ESRD composite rates were between $121 and $144 per treatment, with an overall average of $131 per treatment. The majority of earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated reimbursement rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary rates. The commercial reimbursement rates are under continual pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the reimbursement rates generally decline substantially. 24 Dialysis services revenues by payor type were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Percent of total dialysis revenue: Medicare 52 % 53 % 54 % Medicaid 5 5 5 57 58 59 Commercial and other 43 42 41 100 % 100 % 100 % The number of equivalent hemodialysis treatments associated with the continental U.S. operations totaled approximately 5.7 million, 5.4 million and 5.1 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. The increase in the number of treatments accounted for approximately 40% and 50% of the total growth in dialysis services revenue for 2001 and 2000 respectively. The treatment volume growth in both 2001 and in 2000 was principally associated with same center growth. The treatment growth rate for centers in place for at least one year was approximately 4% for 2001 and 3% for 2000. Approximately 60% and 50% of the increase in dialysis services revenue for 2001 and 2000 was attributable to increases in the average reimbursement rate per treatment. The average revenue recognized per hemodialysis treatment (excluding any prior period services revenue) was $278, $256 and $246 for 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. The substantial increase in 2001 was principally due to continued improvements in revenue realization due to improved clinical operations and billing and collection processes, and a 2.4% increase in the Medicare composite reimbursement rates. The increase in 2000 was principally attributable to the availability of new improved pharmaceuticals and related changes in physician practice patterns which led to the administration of two new higher cost drugs, and a 1.2% increase in Medicare reimbursement rates. The average reimbursement rate for the fourth quarter of 2001 was approximately $283 compared with approximately $280 for the third quarter and $275 for the first half of 2001. Net operating revenues for 2001 included $22 million of cash settlements and collections in excess of our prior estimates for 2000 net revenue. These cash recoveries associated with the prior years services resulted from continued improvements in our billing and collecting operations. Although we continue to pursue collection of aged accounts, we cannot predict the timing or amount of further incremental recoveries or settlements. Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with predicting third party reimbursements in the healthcare industry, our revenue recognition involves significant estimating risks. Such risks and uncertainties are addressed in the AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1, Auditing Health Care Third Party Revenues and Related Receivables. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgement as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the date of the reporting period. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Lab and other services. The discussion regarding contingencies below further addresses revenue recognition uncertainties associated with our Florida laboratory. Because of the unresolved dispute with the third party carrier for Medicare reimbursement claims, we have received no payments for more than three years. During 2000 we discontinued recognizing all Medicare revenue associated with the Florida laboratory until the uncertainties regarding both the timing of resolution and the ultimate revenue valuations are at least substantially eliminated. Although it is impossible to reliably predict the ultimate outcome, we believe it is reasonably possible that the ultimate settlement of this dispute, which may be several years away, could result in substantial recoveries to the Company. Laboratory Medicare billings not recognized as revenue beginning in 2000 because of the third party carrier disputes and the ongoing withhold of payments amount to approximately $5 million per 25 quarter. During 2001, we combined the operations of a second clinical laboratory with our clinical laboratory in Florida. Management fee income. Management fee income represented less than 1% of total revenues for 2001 and 2000. The management fees are established by contract and are typically based on a percentage of revenue of the managed center. As of December 31, 2001, we managed 25 third party dialysis centers utilizing our existing infrastructure. We acquired sixteen previously managed centers during 2001. Dialysis centers and lab expenses. Operating expenses consist of cost and expenses specifically attributable to the operations of dialysis centers and labs, including direct labor, drugs, medical supplies and other patient care service costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of dialysis, lab and pharmacy services, excluding prior period services revenue and non continental U.S. operations, were 67%, 69% and 68% for 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. These costs increased on a per treatment basis from $182 in 2000 to $191 in 2001. This increase was principally due to higher labor and drug costs, which were more than offset by efficiencies in delivering patient treatments as well as increased revenue per treatment. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and labs, and include expenses for corporate and regional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues, excluding non continental U.S. operations and prior period services revenue, were 8.0%, 8.5% and 9.4% for 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. The decline in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for 2001 was due to the increase in revenue being proportionately greater than the 7.5% increase in expenses. The increase in the dollar amount of general and administrative spending in 2001 was primarily related to labor costs. The lower general and administrative expense percentage in 2000 as compared to 1999 was also primarily attributable to the increase in revenue, while the dollar amount of general and administrative expenses declined by $4 million. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. Before considering cash recoveries, the provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately 2% of operating revenues, compared with approximately 3% and 10% for 2000 and 1999. The decrease in the provision resulted from the improvements that were made in billing and collecting processes. During 2001, we realized recoveries of $35 million associated with aged accounts receivables that had been reserved in 1999. The recoveries were a result of our improved collections processes implemented over the past two years. The provision for 2001, net of those recoveries, was a net recovery of $3 million. The high level of provision for uncollectible accounts in 1999 resulted from the Companys inability to achieve its projected cash collection trends during 1999. The rapid growth through acquisitions and the merger with RTC in 1998 had a significant impact on administrative functions, including billing and cash collection processes. The backlog of aged accounts receivable continued to increase during the first half of 1999 due to high turnover of billing and collection personnel and process inefficiencies. The build up of the backlog of aged accounts not processed on a timely basis created collection difficulties at a level not previously experienced, resulting in the unusually high write offs in 1999. Impairment and valuation adjustments. In 1999, we incurred impairment charges of $83 million relating to the sale of our dialysis operations outside the continental United States. We also incurred impairment and valuation losses of $57 million in 1999 associated with the closure of certain dialysis centers within the United States and other investments and loan impairments. The impairment losses were determined based upon estimated net realizable values principally associated with leasehold improvements, loans, investments, intangible assets and future projections of cash flows specific to each center. Additional net charges of $4 million were incurred in 2000. 26 Our policy is to perform impairment reviews for our investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses whenever a change in condition occurs, including changes in our business strategy and plans, or when the third party dialysis business experiences deteriorating operating performance or liquidity problems. With regard to the potential impairment of goodwill balances, we routinely review cash flows associated with the goodwill balances. Debt expense Debt expense for 2001, 2000 and 1999 consisted of interest expense of approximately $70, $113 and $107 million respectively, and the amortization and write off of deferred financing costs of approximately $3 million in 2001, and $4 million in both 2000 and 1999. The decrease in interest expense in 2001 resulted from lower debt balances as well as interest rate reductions. Other income (loss) The net of other income and loss items was income of $4.6 million for 2001 and losses of $7.2 million and $1.9 million for 2000 and 1999. Included in other income (loss) was interest income of $3.2 million, $7.7 million and $4.8 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In 2000, we also had losses of $10.8 million and $4.7 million related to the settlement of a stockholder class action lawsuit and the recognition of the foreign currency translation loss associated with the divestitures of the non continental U.S. operations. The foreign currency translation loss had previously been recognized in comprehensive income. In 1999, equity investment and other non operating losses more than offset interest income. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2001 represented an effective tax rate of 43.4%, compared with approximately 62% in 2000. The high effective rate in 2000 resulted from the relatively low level of pre tax earnings in relation to permanent differences, such as non deductible amortization, deferred tax valuation allowances associated with the sale of non continental U.S. operations and the cancellation of medical director stock options. The provision for income taxes for 1999 was a tax benefit (negative expense) of $35 million, reflecting current and deferred tax benefits resulting from the 1999 pre tax loss. The 1999 tax benefit was reduced by a deferred tax asset valuation allowance for impairment and valuation losses that are capital in nature. For tax purposes, such losses may only be offset against capital gains within a limited carryback and carryforward period. Due to our limited ability to generate capital gains from operations, a tax benefit has not been recorded for these losses. Extraordinary items In 2001, the extraordinary gain of $1 million, net of tax, related to the write off of deferred financing costs offset by the accelerated recognition of deferred interest rate swap liquidation gains as a result of debt refinancing. In 2000, the extraordinary loss of $3.5 million, net of tax, related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with an early extinguishment of debt. In July 2000, we restructured our revolving and term credit facilities. Projections for 2002 Based on current conditions and recent experience, our current projections for 2002 are for normal operating earnings before depreciation and amortization, debt expense and taxes to be in the range of $350 million to $380 27 million. These projections assume minimal acquisitions, an internal annual growth rate of the number of dialysis treatments of approximately 3% 4%, no significant unanticipated changes in pharmaceutical related revenues resulting from procedural, vendor or physician practice pattern changes, and underlying cost growth trends consistent with recent years, with additional substantial investments in our core processes and training planned for 2002. These and other underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. Additionally, the renegotiation or restructuring of unfavorable managed care contracts, medical director agreements or other arrangements may result in future impairment or other charges. We undertake no duty to update these projections, whether due to changes in current or expected trends, underlying market conditions, decisions of the United States Attorneys Office, the DOJ or HHS in any pending or future review of our business, or otherwise. Significant new accounting standard for 2002 In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, including any such intangibles recorded in past business combinations, will not be amortized beginning January 1, 2002. In addition, intangible assets such as patient charts that are neither contractual nor separable under the criteria of SFAS No. 142 will be included as goodwill. SFAS No. 142 specifies that there was to be no amortization recorded for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets resulting from business combinations completed during the last six months of 2001. SFAS No. 142 also requires the assets to be written down with a goodwill impairment charge against current earnings whenever the recorded values exceed their fair values. If this standard had been implemented as of January 1, 2001, amortization expense would have been reduced by $42 million, or $25 million net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2001 and net income and diluted earnings per share would have been approximately $162 million and $1.75 per share. Liquidity and capital resources Cash flow from operations during 2001 amounted to $273 million. Non operating cash flows included $67 million for acquisitions, net of divestitures, (before offsets of $25 million related to reductions in investments in third party dialysis businesses and related advances) and $51 million in capital asset expenditures. During 2000, operating cash flows amounted to $308 million, and divestitures, net of acquisitions, generated an additional $134 million. Capital asset expenditures were $41 million in 2000. During the second quarter of 2001 we issued $225 million of 9% Senior Subordinated Notes and completed a refinancing of our senior credit facilities. The net proceeds of these transactions were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our then existing senior credit facilities. The new senior credit facilities consist of two term loans (totaling $114 million as of December 31, 2001) and a $150 million revolving credit facility (undrawn at December 31, 2001). Total outstanding debt amounted to $820 million at December 31, 2001. Debt, net of cash, amounted to $784 million at December 31, 2001, a reduction of $162 million during the year. In 2000, we negotiated a major restructure of the credit facility and we were able to reduce the total outstanding debt by over $482 million from our operating cash flows and the proceeds from divesting our non continental operations. The continental U.S. accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2001 and 2000 represented approximately 72 and 73 days of net revenue, net of bad debt provision. In November 2001, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our stock over an eighteen month period. As of January 31, 2002, we had repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares for a total cost of approximately $70 million. Our current plans call for a significant increase in capital expenditures over the next year, including significant investment expenditures for information technology systems and for new dialysis centers, relocations 28 and expansions. During 2001, we acquired a total of 21 centers and we opened 7 new centers. We previously managed 16 of the acquired centers, and one of the newly opened centers in 2001 is an unconsolidated center under our management in which we own a minority interest. In addition to the debt obligations reflected in our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. The Company has contingent obligations to purchase the minority interests in several of its joint ventures. These obligations are in the form of put options, exercisable at the minority owners discretion, and require the Company to purchase the minority owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of cash flow. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2001 (000s): Within One Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years  Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 9,034 $ 21,221 $ 217,030 $ 572,939 $ 820,224 Operating leases 47,958 87,643 72,817 98,457 306,875 $ 56,992 $ 108,864 $ 289,847 $ 671,396 $ 1,127,099 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 12,000 $ 12,000 Acquisition of dialysis centers 30,000 $ 4,000 $ 18,000 $ 8,000 60,000 $ 42,000 $ 4,000 $ 18,000 $ 8,000 $ 72,000 We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations over the next twelve months. Contingencies Health care provider revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; and (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements. Our Florida based laboratory subsidiary is the subject of a third party carrier review of its Medicare reimbursement claims. The carrier has issued formal overpayment determinations in the amount of $5.6 million for the review period from January 1995 to April 1996 and $15 million for the review period from May 1996 to March 1998. The carrier has suspended all payments of Medicare claims from this laboratory since May 1998. The carrier also has determined that $16.1 million of the suspended claims for the review period from April 1998 to August 1999 and $11.6 million of the suspended claims for the review period from August 1999 to May 2000 were not properly supported by the prescribing physicians medical justification. The carrier has alleged that approximately 99% of the tests the laboratory performed during the review period from January 1995 to April 1996, 96% of the tests performed in the period from May 1996 to March 1998, 70% of the tests performed in the period from April 1998 to August 1999, and 72% of the tests performed in the period from August 1999 to May 2000 were not properly supported by the prescribing physicians medical justification. We are disputing the overpayment determinations and have provided supporting documentation of our claims. We have initiated the process of a formal review of each of the carriers determinations. The first step in 29 this formal review process is a hearing before a hearing officer at the carrier. The hearing regarding the initial review period from January 1995 to April 1996 was held in July 1999. In January 2000, the hearing officer issued a decision upholding the overpayment determination of $5.6 million. The hearing regarding the second review period from May 1996 to March 1998 was held in April 2000. In July 2000, the hearing officer issued a decision upholding $14.2 million, or substantially all of the overpayment determination. We filed a consolidated appeal of both decisions to a federal administrative law judge. The appeal was divided into two separate hearings. The first of which took place in January 2002, addressed the validity of the two statistical samples the carrier used to support its determinations. We are awaiting the judges decision. The second hearing will address the carriers determinations on the individual claims in the two samples. The administrative law judge has informed us that we can expect the second hearing to occur in the second quarter of 2002. In addition to the formal appeal process with a federal administrative law judge, beginning in the third quarter of 1999 we sought a meeting with the Department of Justice, or DOJ, to begin a process to resolve this matter. The carrier had previously informed the local office of the DOJ and HHS of this matter and we had provided requested information to the DOJ. We met with the DOJ in February 2001, at which time the DOJ requested additional information, which we have provided. Our discussions with the DOJ are ongoing. The timing of the final resolution of this matter is highly uncertain and beyond our control or influence. During 2000, we stopped accruing additional Medicare revenue from this laboratory until the uncertainties regarding both the timing of resolution and the ultimate revenue valuations are at least substantially eliminated. Laboratory Medicare billings not recognized as revenue beginning in 2000 because of the third party carrier disputes and the ongoing withhold of payments amount to approximately $5 million per quarter. We estimate that the potential cash exposure as of December 31, 2001 was not more than $10 million based on the carriers overpayment findings noted above. In addition, the government could impose additional fines and penalties, which could be substantial. At this time we are unable to determine: When this matter will be resolved or when the laboratorys payment suspension will be lifted; The amount of the laboratory claims for which we may be paid; What action the carrier, the DOJ or HHS may take with respect to this matter; Whether the carrier may review additional periods beyond the four identified; and Any outcome of this review, financial or otherwise. An adverse determination could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Medicare carrier for our Minnesota laboratory is conducting a post payment review of Medicare reimbursement claims for the period January 1996 through December 1999. The scope of the review is similar to the review being conducted at our Florida laboratory. At this time, we are unable to determine at this time how long it will take the carrier to complete this review. There is currently no overpayment determination or payment suspension with respect to the Minnesota laboratory. The DOJ has also requested information with respect to this laboratory, which we have provided. Medicare revenues at the Minnesota laboratory, which is much smaller than the Florida laboratory, were approximately $15 million for the period under review. In November 2001, we closed the Minnesota laboratory and combined the operations of this laboratory with our Florida laboratory. In February 2001, the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of the Companys historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and its financial relationships with physicians. The Civil Division has requested that we provide a wide range of information responding to the areas of review. The Civil Division has not initiated any legal process or served any subpoena on us. The Civil Division has indicated that it is not making any allegation of wrongdoing at this time and that no criminal action against us or any 30 individual is contemplated. We are cooperating in this review. The inquiry appears to be at an early stage. As it proceeds, the Civil Division could expand its areas of concern. If a court determines there has been wrongdoing, the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial. In addition to the foregoing, DaVita is subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these additional matters, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 31 RISK FACTORS This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, earnings before depreciation and amortization, debt expense and taxes, and capital expenditures. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we do not intend to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment in which we operate, competitive activities and other business conditions. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include those set forth below. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. If the percentage of our patients paying at or near our list prices declines, then our revenues, cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced. Approximately 43%, 42% and 41% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, were generated from patients who had private payors as the primary payor. A minority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at or near our list prices, which are significantly higher than Medicare rates. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at rates that are below our list prices but, in most cases, higher than Medicare rates. We believe that pressure from private payors to decrease the rates they pay us may increase. If the percentage of patients who have insurance that pays us at or near our list prices decreases significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and earnings. If we are unable to renegotiate material contracts with managed care plans on acceptable terms, we may experience a decline in same center growth. We have contracts with some large managed care plans that include unfavorable terms. Although we are attempting to renegotiate the terms of these contracts, we cannot predict whether we will reach agreement on new terms or whether we will renew these contracts. As a result, we may lose numerous patients of these managed care plans and experience a decline in our same center growth, which would negatively impact our revenues. Future declines, or the lack of further increases, in Medicare reimbursement rates would reduce our net income and cash flows. Approximately 52%, 53%, and 54% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, were generated from patients who had Medicare as their primary payor. The Medicare ESRD program reimburses us for dialysis and ancillary services at fixed rates. Unlike many other Medicare programs, the Medicare ESRD program does not provide for periodic inflation increases in reimbursement rates. These rates have declined over 70% in real dollars since 1972. Increases of 1.2% in 2000 and 2.4% in 2001 were the first increases in the composite rate since 1991, and were significantly less than the cumulative rate of inflation since 1991. There has been no increase to the composite rate for 2002. Increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, have occurred and are expected to continue to occur without a compensating increase in reimbursement rates. We cannot predict the nature or extent of future rate changes, if any. To the extent these rates are not adjusted to keep pace with inflation, our net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. 32 Future changes in the structure of, and reimbursement rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our operating earnings and cash flows. In legislation enacted in December 2000, Congress mandated government studies on whether: The Medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include an annual inflation increase study due July 2002; The Medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include additional services, such as laboratory and other diagnostic tests and the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals, in the composite rate study due July 2002; and Reimbursement for many outpatient prescription drugs that we administer to dialysis patients should be reduced from the current rate of 95% of the average wholesale price. This study was completed; the resulting recommendations exclude most drugs administered during dialysis, but Congress has yet to act on these recommendations. If Medicare began to include in its composite reimbursement rate any ancillary services that it currently reimburses separately, our revenue would decrease to the extent there was not a corresponding increase in that composite rate. In particular, Medicare revenue from EPO was approximately 25% of our total Medicare revenue in 2001, 2000 and 1999. If EPO were included in the composite rate, and if the composite rate were not increased sufficiently, our operating earnings and cash flows could decrease substantially. Reductions in current reimbursement rates for EPO or other outpatient prescription drugs would also reduce our net earnings and cash flows. If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, our revenue and earnings would decline. If a significant number of physicians stop referring patients to our centers, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical directors of the centers. As a result, the primary referral source for our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center. If a medical director agreement terminates, whether before or at the end of its term, it may negatively impact the former medical directors decision to treat his or her patients at our centers. Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally five to ten years. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us. As of December 31, 2001, the agreements with medical directors at 42 centers required renewal on or before December 31, 2002. This includes agreements with terms expiring on or before December 31, 2002 and those with automatic renewal terms that will expire on or before December 31, 2002 if we or the medical director elect not to renew the agreement. In 2001, we renewed agreements with medical directors at 16 centers, and were unable to renew one medical director agreement covering six centers. We have engaged replacement medical directors at these six centers, and the former medical director group is competing with us in a joint venture with another dialysis provider. We also may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships in order to assure compliance with anti kickback and similar laws. These actions could negatively impact physicians decisions to extend their medical director agreements with us. For example, we have recalled stock options and we require monthly statements from our medical directors certifying that they have performed their contractual obligations. To our knowledge, we are the only major dialysis provider to have done this. In addition, if the terms of an existing agreement were found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship, which could lead to the early termination of the agreement. 33 If the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel or our high level of personnel turnover continues, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses. We are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. This shortage limits our ability to expand our operations. We also have a high personnel turnover rate in our dialysis centers. Turnover has been the highest among our reuse technicians, patient care technicians, nurses and unit secretaries. Recent efforts to reduce this turnover may not succeed. If we are not successful, or if we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, our operations and our same center growth will be negatively impacted. Adverse developments with respect to EPO could materially reduce our net income and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients. Amgen is the sole supplier of EPO and may unilaterally decide to increase its price for EPO at any time. For example, Amgen unilaterally increased its base price for EPO by 3.9% in both 2001 and 2000. Also, we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the same discount structure for EPO that we currently receive, or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of discounts within that structure as we have historically achieved. In addition, Amgen has developed a new product, NESP, that may replace EPO or reduce its use with dialysis patients. We cannot predict if or when NESP will be introduced to the U.S. dialysis market, nor what its cost and reimbursement structure will be. Increases in the cost of EPO and the introduction of NESP could have a material adverse effect on our net income and cash flows. Changes in clinical practices and reimbursement rates or rules for EPO and other drugs could substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. The administration of EPO and other drugs accounted for approximately 36%, 35% and 32% of our net operating revenue in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Changes in physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices, changes in private and governmental reimbursement rates and rules, the introduction of new drugs and the conversion to alternate types of administration, for example from intravenous administration to subcutaneous or oral administration, that may also result in lower or less frequent dosages, could reduce our revenues and earnings from the administration of EPO and other drugs. If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations and federal and state anti kickback laws. The regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers, including dialysis providers, has increased significantly in recent years. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, the DOJ announced total recoveries of more than $1.2 billion from healthcare civil fraud cases. In the prior fiscal year, one of our competitors entered into a $486 million settlement as a result of an Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, and DOJ investigation into some of its business practices. In addition, the frequency and intensity of Medicare certification surveys and inspections of dialysis centers has increased markedly since 2000, consistent with recommendations of the OIG. We endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with the anti kickback laws; however, the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations. In addition, our historic dependence on manual processes that vary widely across our network of dialysis centers exposes us to greater risk of errors in billing and other business processes. If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations, we could suffer severe consequences, including: Mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses; 34 Suspension of payments from government reimbursement programs; Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable reimbursement program requirements; Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government reimbursement programs, such as the Medicare ESRD program and Medicaid programs; Loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate; and Fines or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations, submission of false claims or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements. The pending federal review of some of our historical practices and third party carrier review of our laboratory subsidiary could result in substantial penalties against us. We are voluntarily cooperating with the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in a review of some of our historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians. In addition, our Florida based laboratory subsidiary is the subject of a third party carrier review of claims it has submitted for Medicare reimbursement. All further Medicare payments to this laboratory were suspended in May 1998, and the DOJ is also reviewing the situation. We are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved, whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters, financial or otherwise. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our rollout of new information technology systems will significantly disrupt our billing and collection activity, may not work as planned and could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We are rolling out new information technology systems and new processes in each of our dialysis centers over the next few years. It is likely that this rollout will disrupt our billing and collection activity and may cause other disruptions to our business operations, which may negatively impact our cash flows. Also, the new information systems may not work as planned or improve our billing and collection processes. If they do not, we may have to spend substantial amounts to enhance or replace these systems. Provisions in our charter documents and compensation programs we have adopted may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests. Our charter documents include provisions which may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent, requiring 60 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our Board of Directors and granting our Board of Directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval. In addition, most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control. We have also adopted a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock options, which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. Based on the shares of our common stock outstanding and the market price of our stock on December 31, 2001, these cash bonuses would total approximately $74 million. These compensation programs may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay. We may, in the future, adopt other measures that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing an unsolicited takeover, even if such a change of control were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated stockholders. Furthermore, we may adopt some of these measures without any further vote or action by our stockholders. 35 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, and the risk factors set forth in this Form 10 K. These risks, among others, include those relating to possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private and indemnity patients and from ancillary services including the administration of pharmaceuticals, the ongoing payment suspension and review of the Companys Florida laboratory subsidiary by its Medicare carrier and the Department of Justice, the ongoing review by the Civil Division of the US Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Companys ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in our forward looking statements. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we have no current intention to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Prior to mid 1999, the company had an aggressive growth strategy of acquiring other dialysis businesses. This rapid growth through acquisitions had a significant impact on administrative functions and operating efficiencies. In October 1999, Kent Thiry was named our chairman and chief executive officer, and we initiated a turnaround plan focused on improving our financial and operational infrastructure. During 2000, we divested substantially all of our operations outside the continental United States, made significant improvements in our billing and collecting operations, reduced our debt and restructured our credit facilities. We achieved further improvements in operating systems and processes during 2001, and we will be making significant investments in new systems and processes in 2002. Results of operations Continental U.S. and non continental U.S. operating revenues and operating expenses were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (dollars in millions) Operating revenues: Continental U.S. $ 1,636 99 % $ 1,412 95 % $ 1,321 91 % Non continental U.S. 15 1 % 74 5 % 124 9 % $ 1,651 100 % $ 1,486 100 % $ 1,445 100 % Operating expenses: Continental U.S. $ 1,317 99 % $ 1,234 94 % $ 1,243 83 % Non continental U.S. 16 1 % 73 6 % 126 8 % Impairment and merger costs 4 140 9 % $ 1,333 100 % $ 1,311 100 % $ 1,509 100 % Because all operations outside the continental United States have been divested with the exception of the pending completion of the sale of two centers in Puerto Rico, the non continental U.S. operating results are excluded from the revenue and cost trends discussed below. 23 Operating results excluding the non continental U.S. operations were as follows (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for non continental U.S. operating results): Continental U.S. Operations Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (dollars in millions) Operating revenues (excluding $22 million of prior period services revenue in 2001) $ 1,614 100 % $ 1,412 100 % $ 1,321 100 % Operating expenses: Dialysis centers and labs 1,087 67 % 973 69 % 893 68 % General and administrative 129 8 % 120 8 % 124 9 % Depreciation and amortization 104 6 % 103 7 % 99 7 % Provision for uncollectible accounts (excluding $35 million of recoveries in 2001 of amounts reserved in 1999) 32 2 % 38 3 % 127 10 % 1,352 84 % 1,234 87 % 1,243 94 % Operating income (excluding impairment losses, recoveries and prior period services revenue) $ 262 16 % $ 178 13 % $ 78 6 % Impairments and valuation losses/(gains): Non continental U.S. operations $ 1 $ (1 ) $ 83 Continental U.S. operations (1 ) 5 57 $ $ 4 $ 140 Dialysis treatments (000s) 5,690 5,354 5,139 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 278 $ 256 $ 246 Dialysis services revenue represented 98%, 97% and 96% of total operating revenues in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Lab, other and management fee income account for the balance of revenues. Dialysis services. Dialysis services include outpatient center hemodialysis, which accounts for approximately 87% of total dialysis treatments, home dialysis, and inpatient hemodialysis with contracted hospitals. Major components of dialysis revenue include the administration of EPO, which represents approximately 25% of operating revenues, and other drugs which are administered as part of the dialysis treatment. Dialysis services are paid for primarily by Medicare and state Medicaid programs in accordance with rates established by CMS, and by other third party payors such as HMOs and health insurance carriers. Services provided to patients covered by third party insurance companies are normally reimbursed at rates higher than Medicare or Medicaid rates. Patients covered by employer group health plans convert to Medicare after a maximum of 33 months. As of year end 2001, the Medicare ESRD composite rates were between $121 and $144 per treatment, with an overall average of $131 per treatment. The majority of earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated reimbursement rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary rates. The commercial reimbursement rates are under continual pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the reimbursement rates generally decline substantially. 24 Dialysis services revenues by payor type were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Percent of total dialysis revenue: Medicare 52 % 53 % 54 % Medicaid 5 5 5 57 58 59 Commercial and other 43 42 41 100 % 100 % 100 % The number of equivalent hemodialysis treatments associated with the continental U.S. operations totaled approximately 5.7 million, 5.4 million and 5.1 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. The increase in the number of treatments accounted for approximately 40% and 50% of the total growth in dialysis services revenue for 2001 and 2000 respectively. The treatment volume growth in both 2001 and in 2000 was principally associated with same center growth. The treatment growth rate for centers in place for at least one year was approximately 4% for 2001 and 3% for 2000. Approximately 60% and 50% of the increase in dialysis services revenue for 2001 and 2000 was attributable to increases in the average reimbursement rate per treatment. The average revenue recognized per hemodialysis treatment (excluding any prior period services revenue) was $278, $256 and $246 for 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. The substantial increase in 2001 was principally due to continued improvements in revenue realization due to improved clinical operations and billing and collection processes, and a 2.4% increase in the Medicare composite reimbursement rates. The increase in 2000 was principally attributable to the availability of new improved pharmaceuticals and related changes in physician practice patterns which led to the administration of two new higher cost drugs, and a 1.2% increase in Medicare reimbursement rates. The average reimbursement rate for the fourth quarter of 2001 was approximately $283 compared with approximately $280 for the third quarter and $275 for the first half of 2001. Net operating revenues for 2001 included $22 million of cash settlements and collections in excess of our prior estimates for 2000 net revenue. These cash recoveries associated with the prior years services resulted from continued improvements in our billing and collecting operations. Although we continue to pursue collection of aged accounts, we cannot predict the timing or amount of further incremental recoveries or settlements. Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with predicting third party reimbursements in the healthcare industry, our revenue recognition involves significant estimating risks. Such risks and uncertainties are addressed in the AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1, Auditing Health Care Third Party Revenues and Related Receivables. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgement as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the date of the reporting period. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Lab and other services. The discussion regarding contingencies below further addresses revenue recognition uncertainties associated with our Florida laboratory. Because of the unresolved dispute with the third party carrier for Medicare reimbursement claims, we have received no payments for more than three years. During 2000 we discontinued recognizing all Medicare revenue associated with the Florida laboratory until the uncertainties regarding both the timing of resolution and the ultimate revenue valuations are at least substantially eliminated. Although it is impossible to reliably predict the ultimate outcome, we believe it is reasonably possible that the ultimate settlement of this dispute, which may be several years away, could result in substantial recoveries to the Company. Laboratory Medicare billings not recognized as revenue beginning in 2000 because of the third party carrier disputes and the ongoing withhold of payments amount to approximately $5 million per 25 quarter. During 2001, we combined the operations of a second clinical laboratory with our clinical laboratory in Florida. Management fee income. Management fee income represented less than 1% of total revenues for 2001 and 2000. The management fees are established by contract and are typically based on a percentage of revenue of the managed center. As of December 31, 2001, we managed 25 third party dialysis centers utilizing our existing infrastructure. We acquired sixteen previously managed centers during 2001. Dialysis centers and lab expenses. Operating expenses consist of cost and expenses specifically attributable to the operations of dialysis centers and labs, including direct labor, drugs, medical supplies and other patient care service costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of dialysis, lab and pharmacy services, excluding prior period services revenue and non continental U.S. operations, were 67%, 69% and 68% for 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. These costs increased on a per treatment basis from $182 in 2000 to $191 in 2001. This increase was principally due to higher labor and drug costs, which were more than offset by efficiencies in delivering patient treatments as well as increased revenue per treatment. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and labs, and include expenses for corporate and regional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues, excluding non continental U.S. operations and prior period services revenue, were 8.0%, 8.5% and 9.4% for 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. The decline in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for 2001 was due to the increase in revenue being proportionately greater than the 7.5% increase in expenses. The increase in the dollar amount of general and administrative spending in 2001 was primarily related to labor costs. The lower general and administrative expense percentage in 2000 as compared to 1999 was also primarily attributable to the increase in revenue, while the dollar amount of general and administrative expenses declined by $4 million. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. Before considering cash recoveries, the provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately 2% of operating revenues, compared with approximately 3% and 10% for 2000 and 1999. The decrease in the provision resulted from the improvements that were made in billing and collecting processes. During 2001, we realized recoveries of $35 million associated with aged accounts receivables that had been reserved in 1999. The recoveries were a result of our improved collections processes implemented over the past two years. The provision for 2001, net of those recoveries, was a net recovery of $3 million. The high level of provision for uncollectible accounts in 1999 resulted from the Companys inability to achieve its projected cash collection trends during 1999. The rapid growth through acquisitions and the merger with RTC in 1998 had a significant impact on administrative functions, including billing and cash collection processes. The backlog of aged accounts receivable continued to increase during the first half of 1999 due to high turnover of billing and collection personnel and process inefficiencies. The build up of the backlog of aged accounts not processed on a timely basis created collection difficulties at a level not previously experienced, resulting in the unusually high write offs in 1999. Impairment and valuation adjustments. In 1999, we incurred impairment charges of $83 million relating to the sale of our dialysis operations outside the continental United States. We also incurred impairment and valuation losses of $57 million in 1999 associated with the closure of certain dialysis centers within the United States and other investments and loan impairments. The impairment losses were determined based upon estimated net realizable values principally associated with leasehold improvements, loans, investments, intangible assets and future projections of cash flows specific to each center. Additional net charges of $4 million were incurred in 2000. 26 Our policy is to perform impairment reviews for our investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses whenever a change in condition occurs, including changes in our business strategy and plans, or when the third party dialysis business experiences deteriorating operating performance or liquidity problems. With regard to the potential impairment of goodwill balances, we routinely review cash flows associated with the goodwill balances. Debt expense Debt expense for 2001, 2000 and 1999 consisted of interest expense of approximately $70, $113 and $107 million respectively, and the amortization and write off of deferred financing costs of approximately $3 million in 2001, and $4 million in both 2000 and 1999. The decrease in interest expense in 2001 resulted from lower debt balances as well as interest rate reductions. Other income (loss) The net of other income and loss items was income of $4.6 million for 2001 and losses of $7.2 million and $1.9 million for 2000 and 1999. Included in other income (loss) was interest income of $3.2 million, $7.7 million and $4.8 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In 2000, we also had losses of $10.8 million and $4.7 million related to the settlement of a stockholder class action lawsuit and the recognition of the foreign currency translation loss associated with the divestitures of the non continental U.S. operations. The foreign currency translation loss had previously been recognized in comprehensive income. In 1999, equity investment and other non operating losses more than offset interest income. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2001 represented an effective tax rate of 43.4%, compared with approximately 62% in 2000. The high effective rate in 2000 resulted from the relatively low level of pre tax earnings in relation to permanent differences, such as non deductible amortization, deferred tax valuation allowances associated with the sale of non continental U.S. operations and the cancellation of medical director stock options. The provision for income taxes for 1999 was a tax benefit (negative expense) of $35 million, reflecting current and deferred tax benefits resulting from the 1999 pre tax loss. The 1999 tax benefit was reduced by a deferred tax asset valuation allowance for impairment and valuation losses that are capital in nature. For tax purposes, such losses may only be offset against capital gains within a limited carryback and carryforward period. Due to our limited ability to generate capital gains from operations, a tax benefit has not been recorded for these losses. Extraordinary items In 2001, the extraordinary gain of $1 million, net of tax, related to the write off of deferred financing costs offset by the accelerated recognition of deferred interest rate swap liquidation gains as a result of debt refinancing. In 2000, the extraordinary loss of $3.5 million, net of tax, related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with an early extinguishment of debt. In July 2000, we restructured our revolving and term credit facilities. Projections for 2002 Based on current conditions and recent experience, our current projections for 2002 are for normal operating earnings before depreciation and amortization, debt expense and taxes to be in the range of $350 million to $380 27 million. These projections assume minimal acquisitions, an internal annual growth rate of the number of dialysis treatments of approximately 3% 4%, no significant unanticipated changes in pharmaceutical related revenues resulting from procedural, vendor or physician practice pattern changes, and underlying cost growth trends consistent with recent years, with additional substantial investments in our core processes and training planned for 2002. These and other underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. Additionally, the renegotiation or restructuring of unfavorable managed care contracts, medical director agreements or other arrangements may result in future impairment or other charges. We undertake no duty to update these projections, whether due to changes in current or expected trends, underlying market conditions, decisions of the United States Attorneys Office, the DOJ or HHS in any pending or future review of our business, or otherwise. Significant new accounting standard for 2002 In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, including any such intangibles recorded in past business combinations, will not be amortized beginning January 1, 2002. In addition, intangible assets such as patient charts that are neither contractual nor separable under the criteria of SFAS No. 142 will be included as goodwill. SFAS No. 142 specifies that there was to be no amortization recorded for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets resulting from business combinations completed during the last six months of 2001. SFAS No. 142 also requires the assets to be written down with a goodwill impairment charge against current earnings whenever the recorded values exceed their fair values. If this standard had been implemented as of January 1, 2001, amortization expense would have been reduced by $42 million, or $25 million net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2001 and net income and diluted earnings per share would have been approximately $162 million and $1.75 per share. Liquidity and capital resources Cash flow from operations during 2001 amounted to $273 million. Non operating cash flows included $67 million for acquisitions, net of divestitures, (before offsets of $25 million related to reductions in investments in third party dialysis businesses and related advances) and $51 million in capital asset expenditures. During 2000, operating cash flows amounted to $308 million, and divestitures, net of acquisitions, generated an additional $134 million. Capital asset expenditures were $41 million in 2000. During the second quarter of 2001 we issued $225 million of 9% Senior Subordinated Notes and completed a refinancing of our senior credit facilities. The net proceeds of these transactions were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our then existing senior credit facilities. The new senior credit facilities consist of two term loans (totaling $114 million as of December 31, 2001) and a $150 million revolving credit facility (undrawn at December 31, 2001). Total outstanding debt amounted to $820 million at December 31, 2001. Debt, net of cash, amounted to $784 million at December 31, 2001, a reduction of $162 million during the year. In 2000, we negotiated a major restructure of the credit facility and we were able to reduce the total outstanding debt by over $482 million from our operating cash flows and the proceeds from divesting our non continental operations. The continental U.S. accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2001 and 2000 represented approximately 72 and 73 days of net revenue, net of bad debt provision. In November 2001, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our stock over an eighteen month period. As of January 31, 2002, we had repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares for a total cost of approximately $70 million. Our current plans call for a significant increase in capital expenditures over the next year, including significant investment expenditures for information technology systems and for new dialysis centers, relocations 28 and expansions. During 2001, we acquired a total of 21 centers and we opened 7 new centers. We previously managed 16 of the acquired centers, and one of the newly opened centers in 2001 is an unconsolidated center under our management in which we own a minority interest. In addition to the debt obligations reflected in our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. The Company has contingent obligations to purchase the minority interests in several of its joint ventures. These obligations are in the form of put options, exercisable at the minority owners discretion, and require the Company to purchase the minority owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of cash flow. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2001 (000s): Within One Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years  Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 9,034 $ 21,221 $ 217,030 $ 572,939 $ 820,224 Operating leases 47,958 87,643 72,817 98,457 306,875 $ 56,992 $ 108,864 $ 289,847 $ 671,396 $ 1,127,099 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 12,000 $ 12,000 Acquisition of dialysis centers 30,000 $ 4,000 $ 18,000 $ 8,000 60,000 $ 42,000 $ 4,000 $ 18,000 $ 8,000 $ 72,000 We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations over the next twelve months. Contingencies Health care provider revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; and (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements. Our Florida based laboratory subsidiary is the subject of a third party carrier review of its Medicare reimbursement claims. The carrier has issued formal overpayment determinations in the amount of $5.6 million for the review period from January 1995 to April 1996 and $15 million for the review period from May 1996 to March 1998. The carrier has suspended all payments of Medicare claims from this laboratory since May 1998. The carrier also has determined that $16.1 million of the suspended claims for the review period from April 1998 to August 1999 and $11.6 million of the suspended claims for the review period from August 1999 to May 2000 were not properly supported by the prescribing physicians medical justification. The carrier has alleged that approximately 99% of the tests the laboratory performed during the review period from January 1995 to April 1996, 96% of the tests performed in the period from May 1996 to March 1998, 70% of the tests performed in the period from April 1998 to August 1999, and 72% of the tests performed in the period from August 1999 to May 2000 were not properly supported by the prescribing physicians medical justification. We are disputing the overpayment determinations and have provided supporting documentation of our claims. We have initiated the process of a formal review of each of the carriers determinations. The first step in 29 this formal review process is a hearing before a hearing officer at the carrier. The hearing regarding the initial review period from January 1995 to April 1996 was held in July 1999. In January 2000, the hearing officer issued a decision upholding the overpayment determination of $5.6 million. The hearing regarding the second review period from May 1996 to March 1998 was held in April 2000. In July 2000, the hearing officer issued a decision upholding $14.2 million, or substantially all of the overpayment determination. We filed a consolidated appeal of both decisions to a federal administrative law judge. The appeal was divided into two separate hearings. The first of which took place in January 2002, addressed the validity of the two statistical samples the carrier used to support its determinations. We are awaiting the judges decision. The second hearing will address the carriers determinations on the individual claims in the two samples. The administrative law judge has informed us that we can expect the second hearing to occur in the second quarter of 2002. In addition to the formal appeal process with a federal administrative law judge, beginning in the third quarter of 1999 we sought a meeting with the Department of Justice, or DOJ, to begin a process to resolve this matter. The carrier had previously informed the local office of the DOJ and HHS of this matter and we had provided requested information to the DOJ. We met with the DOJ in February 2001, at which time the DOJ requested additional information, which we have provided. Our discussions with the DOJ are ongoing. The timing of the final resolution of this matter is highly uncertain and beyond our control or influence. During 2000, we stopped accruing additional Medicare revenue from this laboratory until the uncertainties regarding both the timing of resolution and the ultimate revenue valuations are at least substantially eliminated. Laboratory Medicare billings not recognized as revenue beginning in 2000 because of the third party carrier disputes and the ongoing withhold of payments amount to approximately $5 million per quarter. We estimate that the potential cash exposure as of December 31, 2001 was not more than $10 million based on the carriers overpayment findings noted above. In addition, the government could impose additional fines and penalties, which could be substantial. At this time we are unable to determine: When this matter will be resolved or when the laboratorys payment suspension will be lifted; The amount of the laboratory claims for which we may be paid; What action the carrier, the DOJ or HHS may take with respect to this matter; Whether the carrier may review additional periods beyond the four identified; and Any outcome of this review, financial or otherwise. An adverse determination could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Medicare carrier for our Minnesota laboratory is conducting a post payment review of Medicare reimbursement claims for the period January 1996 through December 1999. The scope of the review is similar to the review being conducted at our Florida laboratory. At this time, we are unable to determine at this time how long it will take the carrier to complete this review. There is currently no overpayment determination or payment suspension with respect to the Minnesota laboratory. The DOJ has also requested information with respect to this laboratory, which we have provided. Medicare revenues at the Minnesota laboratory, which is much smaller than the Florida laboratory, were approximately $15 million for the period under review. In November 2001, we closed the Minnesota laboratory and combined the operations of this laboratory with our Florida laboratory. In February 2001, the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of the Companys historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and its financial relationships with physicians. The Civil Division has requested that we provide a wide range of information responding to the areas of review. The Civil Division has not initiated any legal process or served any subpoena on us. The Civil Division has indicated that it is not making any allegation of wrongdoing at this time and that no criminal action against us or any 30 individual is contemplated. We are cooperating in this review. The inquiry appears to be at an early stage. As it proceeds, the Civil Division could expand its areas of concern. If a court determines there has been wrongdoing, the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial. In addition to the foregoing, DaVita is subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these additional matters, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 31 RISK FACTORS This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, earnings before depreciation and amortization, debt expense and taxes, and capital expenditures. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we do not intend to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment in which we operate, competitive activities and other business conditions. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include those set forth below. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. If the percentage of our patients paying at or near our list prices declines, then our revenues, cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced. Approximately 43%, 42% and 41% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, were generated from patients who had private payors as the primary payor. A minority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at or near our list prices, which are significantly higher than Medicare rates. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at rates that are below our list prices but, in most cases, higher than Medicare rates. We believe that pressure from private payors to decrease the rates they pay us may increase. If the percentage of patients who have insurance that pays us at or near our list prices decreases significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and earnings. If we are unable to renegotiate material contracts with managed care plans on acceptable terms, we may experience a decline in same center growth. We have contracts with some large managed care plans that include unfavorable terms. Although we are attempting to renegotiate the terms of these contracts, we cannot predict whether we will reach agreement on new terms or whether we will renew these contracts. As a result, we may lose numerous patients of these managed care plans and experience a decline in our same center growth, which would negatively impact our revenues. Future declines, or the lack of further increases, in Medicare reimbursement rates would reduce our net income and cash flows. Approximately 52%, 53%, and 54% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, were generated from patients who had Medicare as their primary payor. The Medicare ESRD program reimburses us for dialysis and ancillary services at fixed rates. Unlike many other Medicare programs, the Medicare ESRD program does not provide for periodic inflation increases in reimbursement rates. These rates have declined over 70% in real dollars since 1972. Increases of 1.2% in 2000 and 2.4% in 2001 were the first increases in the composite rate since 1991, and were significantly less than the cumulative rate of inflation since 1991. There has been no increase to the composite rate for 2002. Increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, have occurred and are expected to continue to occur without a compensating increase in reimbursement rates. We cannot predict the nature or extent of future rate changes, if any. To the extent these rates are not adjusted to keep pace with inflation, our net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. 32 Future changes in the structure of, and reimbursement rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our operating earnings and cash flows. In legislation enacted in December 2000, Congress mandated government studies on whether: The Medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include an annual inflation increase study due July 2002; The Medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include additional services, such as laboratory and other diagnostic tests and the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals, in the composite rate study due July 2002; and Reimbursement for many outpatient prescription drugs that we administer to dialysis patients should be reduced from the current rate of 95% of the average wholesale price. This study was completed; the resulting recommendations exclude most drugs administered during dialysis, but Congress has yet to act on these recommendations. If Medicare began to include in its composite reimbursement rate any ancillary services that it currently reimburses separately, our revenue would decrease to the extent there was not a corresponding increase in that composite rate. In particular, Medicare revenue from EPO was approximately 25% of our total Medicare revenue in 2001, 2000 and 1999. If EPO were included in the composite rate, and if the composite rate were not increased sufficiently, our operating earnings and cash flows could decrease substantially. Reductions in current reimbursement rates for EPO or other outpatient prescription drugs would also reduce our net earnings and cash flows. If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, our revenue and earnings would decline. If a significant number of physicians stop referring patients to our centers, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical directors of the centers. As a result, the primary referral source for our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center. If a medical director agreement terminates, whether before or at the end of its term, it may negatively impact the former medical directors decision to treat his or her patients at our centers. Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally five to ten years. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us. As of December 31, 2001, the agreements with medical directors at 42 centers required renewal on or before December 31, 2002. This includes agreements with terms expiring on or before December 31, 2002 and those with automatic renewal terms that will expire on or before December 31, 2002 if we or the medical director elect not to renew the agreement. In 2001, we renewed agreements with medical directors at 16 centers, and were unable to renew one medical director agreement covering six centers. We have engaged replacement medical directors at these six centers, and the former medical director group is competing with us in a joint venture with another dialysis provider. We also may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships in order to assure compliance with anti kickback and similar laws. These actions could negatively impact physicians decisions to extend their medical director agreements with us. For example, we have recalled stock options and we require monthly statements from our medical directors certifying that they have performed their contractual obligations. To our knowledge, we are the only major dialysis provider to have done this. In addition, if the terms of an existing agreement were found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship, which could lead to the early termination of the agreement. 33 If the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel or our high level of personnel turnover continues, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses. We are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. This shortage limits our ability to expand our operations. We also have a high personnel turnover rate in our dialysis centers. Turnover has been the highest among our reuse technicians, patient care technicians, nurses and unit secretaries. Recent efforts to reduce this turnover may not succeed. If we are not successful, or if we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, our operations and our same center growth will be negatively impacted. Adverse developments with respect to EPO could materially reduce our net income and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients. Amgen is the sole supplier of EPO and may unilaterally decide to increase its price for EPO at any time. For example, Amgen unilaterally increased its base price for EPO by 3.9% in both 2001 and 2000. Also, we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the same discount structure for EPO that we currently receive, or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of discounts within that structure as we have historically achieved. In addition, Amgen has developed a new product, NESP, that may replace EPO or reduce its use with dialysis patients. We cannot predict if or when NESP will be introduced to the U.S. dialysis market, nor what its cost and reimbursement structure will be. Increases in the cost of EPO and the introduction of NESP could have a material adverse effect on our net income and cash flows. Changes in clinical practices and reimbursement rates or rules for EPO and other drugs could substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. The administration of EPO and other drugs accounted for approximately 36%, 35% and 32% of our net operating revenue in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Changes in physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices, changes in private and governmental reimbursement rates and rules, the introduction of new drugs and the conversion to alternate types of administration, for example from intravenous administration to subcutaneous or oral administration, that may also result in lower or less frequent dosages, could reduce our revenues and earnings from the administration of EPO and other drugs. If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations and federal and state anti kickback laws. The regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers, including dialysis providers, has increased significantly in recent years. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, the DOJ announced total recoveries of more than $1.2 billion from healthcare civil fraud cases. In the prior fiscal year, one of our competitors entered into a $486 million settlement as a result of an Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, and DOJ investigation into some of its business practices. In addition, the frequency and intensity of Medicare certification surveys and inspections of dialysis centers has increased markedly since 2000, consistent with recommendations of the OIG. We endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with the anti kickback laws; however, the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations. In addition, our historic dependence on manual processes that vary widely across our network of dialysis centers exposes us to greater risk of errors in billing and other business processes. If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations, we could suffer severe consequences, including: Mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses; 34 Suspension of payments from government reimbursement programs; Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable reimbursement program requirements; Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government reimbursement programs, such as the Medicare ESRD program and Medicaid programs; Loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate; and Fines or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations, submission of false claims or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements. The pending federal review of some of our historical practices and third party carrier review of our laboratory subsidiary could result in substantial penalties against us. We are voluntarily cooperating with the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in a review of some of our historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians. In addition, our Florida based laboratory subsidiary is the subject of a third party carrier review of claims it has submitted for Medicare reimbursement. All further Medicare payments to this laboratory were suspended in May 1998, and the DOJ is also reviewing the situation. We are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved, whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters, financial or otherwise. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our rollout of new information technology systems will significantly disrupt our billing and collection activity, may not work as planned and could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We are rolling out new information technology systems and new processes in each of our dialysis centers over the next few years. It is likely that this rollout will disrupt our billing and collection activity and may cause other disruptions to our business operations, which may negatively impact our cash flows. Also, the new information systems may not work as planned or improve our billing and collection processes. If they do not, we may have to spend substantial amounts to enhance or replace these systems. Provisions in our charter documents and compensation programs we have adopted may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests. Our charter documents include provisions which may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent, requiring 60 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our Board of Directors and granting our Board of Directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval. In addition, most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control. We have also adopted a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock options, which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. Based on the shares of our common stock outstanding and the market price of our stock on December 31, 2001, these cash bonuses would total approximately $74 million. These compensation programs may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay. We may, in the future, adopt other measures that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing an unsolicited takeover, even if such a change of control were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated stockholders. Furthermore, we may adopt some of these measures without any further vote or action by our stockholders. 35 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
