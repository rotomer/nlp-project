Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 19 Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The following table presents selected consolidated financial and operating data for the periods indicated. The following financial and operating data should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this report. Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 (in thousands, except share data) Income statement data: Net operating revenues(1) $ 1,854,632 $ 1,650,753 $ 1,486,302 $ 1,445,351 $ 1,203,738 Total operating expenses(2) 1,463,300 1,332,761 1,311,587 1,509,333 1,068,825 Operating income (loss) 391,332 317,992 174,715 (63,982 ) 134,913 Other income (loss), net 5,790 4,644 (7,201 ) (1,895 ) 4,894 Debt expense(3) 71,636 72,438 116,637 110,797 84,003 Minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries (9,299 ) (9,260 ) (5,942 ) (5,152 ) (7,163 ) Income (loss) before income taxes, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 316,187 240,938 44,935 (181,826 ) 48,641 Income tax expense (benefit) 129,500 104,600 27,960 (34,570 ) 38,449 Income (loss) before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ 186,687 $ 136,338 $ 16,975 $ (147,256 ) $ 10,192 Net income (loss)(4) $ 157,329 $ 137,315 $ 13,485 $ (147,256 ) $ (9,448 ) Basic earnings (loss) per common share: Income (loss) before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ 2.60 $ 1.63 $ 0.21 $ (1.81 ) $ 0.12 Net income (loss)(4) $ 2.19 $ 1.64 $ 0.17 $ (1.81 ) $ (0.12 ) Diluted earnings (loss) per common share: Income (loss) before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ 2.28 $ 1.51 $ 0.20 $ (1.81 ) $ 0.12 Net income (loss)(4) $ 1.96 $ 1.52 $ 0.16 $ (1.81 ) $ (0.12 ) Ratio of earnings to fixed charges(5)(6) 4.35:1 3.63:1 1.32:1 See (6) 1.49:1 Balance sheet data: Working capital(7) $ 251,925 $ 175,983 $ 148,348 $ (1,043,796 ) $ 388,064 Total assets 1,775,693 1,662,683 1,596,632 2,056,718 1,911,619 Long term debt(8) 1,311,252 811,190 974,006 5,696 1,225,781 Shareholders equity(9) 70,264 503,637 349,368 326,404 473,864 (1) Net operating revenues include $58,778 in 2002 of prior years services revenue relating to Medicare lab revenue, and $22,000 in 2001 of prior years dialysis services revenue relating to cash settlements and collections in excess of prior estimates. (2) Total operating expenses include expense offsets from recoveries of $5,192 in 2002, and $35,220 in 2001 of accounts receivable reserved in 1999, a net gain for impairments and valuation adjustments of $380 in 2002 20 and net impairment losses of $4,556 in 2000, $139,805 in impairment and valuation losses in 1999 principally associated with the disposition of the Companys non continental U.S. operations and merger related costs of $78,188 in 1998. (3) Debt expense includes write offs of deferred financing costs of $1,192 in 2000 and $1,601 in 1999, and a loss on termination of interest rate swap agreements related to refinanced debt of $9,823 in 1998. (4) Net income (loss) includes an extraordinary loss of $29,358 ($0.41 per share basic, $0.32 per share diluted) in 2002 resulting from the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the retirement of the $225,000 outstanding 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011, an extraordinary gain of $977 ($0.01 per share) in 2001 relating to the write off of deferred financing costs and the associated accelerated swap liquidation gains resulting from debt refinancing, and extraordinary losses associated with early extinguishment of debt of $3,490 ($0.04 per share) in 2000 and $12,744 ($0.16 per share) in 1998. In 1998 we adopted AICPA Statement of Position No. 98 5 Reporting on the Costs for Start up Activities which requires that pre opening and organization costs be expensed as incurred. As a result, unamortized deferred pre opening and organizational costs of $6,896 ($0.08 per share) were written off as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in 1998. (5) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is computed by dividing fixed charges into earnings. Earnings for this purpose is defined as pretax income from operations adjusted by adding back fixed charges excluding interest capitalized during the period. Fixed charges are defined as the total of interest expense, amortization of financing costs, capitalized interest and the estimated interest component of rental expense on operating leases. (6) Due to our loss in 1999, the ratio coverage in 1999 was less than 1:1. We would have had to generate additional earnings of $182,535 to achieve a coverage of 1:1. (7) The working capital calculation as of December 31, 1999 includes long term debt of $1,425,610 that was potentially callable under covenant provisions. (8) Long term debt as of December 31, 1999 excludes $1,425,610 that was potentially callable under covenant provisions. (9) We repurchased 27,327,477 shares of common stock for $642,171 in 2002 and 888,700 shares of common stock for $20,360 in 2001. 21 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, and the risk factors set forth in this Form 10 K. These risks, among others, include those relating to possible reductions in private mix and private and government reimbursement rates, the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients and from ancillary services including the administration of pharmaceuticals, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, the ongoing review of the Companys Florida laboratory subsidiary by its Medicare carrier and the DOJ, the ongoing review by the US Attorneys Office and the OIG in Philadelphia and the Companys ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in our forward looking statements. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we have no current intention to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Results of operations Our operating results, excluding prior period service recoveries, for the year ended December 31, 2002 were in line with our projected range, with no significant unanticipated changes in dialysis revenue, expense trends or EBITDA, and no material changes in our general risk assessments. However, positive developments regarding disputed Medicare claims at our Florida laboratory have allowed us to recognize Medicare lab revenue for current and prior services beginning in the third quarter of 2002. The following is a summary of continental U. S. and non continental U.S. operating revenues and operating expenses: Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (dollars in millions) Operating revenues: Continental U.S. $ 1,849 100 % $ 1,636 99 % $ 1,412 95 % Non continental U.S. 6 15 1 % 74 5 % $ 1,855 100 % $ 1,651 100 % $ 1,486 100 % Operating expenses: Continental U.S. $ 1,458 100 % $ 1,317 99 % $ 1,234 94 % Non continental U.S. 6 16 1 % 73 6 % Impairment valuation adjustments 4 $ 1,464 100 % $ 1,333 100 % $ 1,311 100 % 22 The divestiture of our dialysis operations outside the continental United States was substantially completed during 2000, and the sale of our remaining centers in Puerto Rico was completed during the second quarter of 2002. Therefore, the non continental U.S. operating results are excluded from the revenue and cost trends discussed below. Continental operating results were as follows (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for non continental U.S. operating results): Continental U.S. Operations Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (dollars in millions) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 1,790 100 % $ 1,614 100 % $ 1,412 100 % Prior years services laboratory 59 Prior years services dialysis 22 Operating expenses: Dialysis centers and labs 1,212 68 % 1,087 67 % 973 69 % General and administrative 154 9 % 129 8 % 120 8 % Depreciation and amortization(a) 65 4 % 62 4 % 58 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts(b) 32 2 % 32 2 % 38 3 % 1,463 82 % 1,310 81 % 1,189 84 % Operating income current period services(a)(b) $ 327 18 % $ 304 19 % $ 223 16 % Impairments and valuation losses (gains): Continental U.S. operations $ 1 $ (1 ) $ 5 Non continental U.S. operations (1 ) 1 (1 ) $ $ $ 4 Dialysis treatments (000s) 5,975 5,690 5,354 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 19,090 18,185 17,066 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 291 $ 278 $ 256 (a) For comparison purposes, excludes goodwill amortization of $42 million in 2001, and $45 million in 2000. Goodwill is not amortized effective for 2002 per SFAS No. 142. (b) Excludes approximately $5 and $35 million of recoveries in 2002 and 2001 of amounts reserved in 1999. Operating income as presented also excludes $59 and $22 million of prior years services revenues in 2002 and 2001. Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with predicting third party reimbursements in the healthcare industry, our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Such risks and uncertainties are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1 Auditing Health Care Third Party Revenues and Related Receivables. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgement as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. The net operating revenues for continental U.S. operations of $1,790 million in 2002 and $1,614 million in 2001 represent annual increases of $176 million or 11% and $202 million or 14%, respectively. Approximately 50% and 60% of the increase in dialysis services revenue for 2002 and 2001 was attributable to increases in the average reimbursement rate per treatment and approximately 50% and 40% was due to an increase in the number of dialysis treatments. The increase in 2002 also included approximately $21 million of current year Medicare laboratory revenue. As discussed below, we had not recognized any Medicare laboratory revenue during 2001 due to the ongoing dispute with the third party carrier. 23 Dialysis services revenue Dialysis services revenue, excluding prior period service revenue, represented 97%, 98% and 97% of current operating revenues in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Lab, other and management fee income account for the balance of revenues. Dialysis services include outpatient center hemodialysis, which accounts for approximately 88% of total dialysis treatments, home dialysis, and inpatient hemodialysis with contracted hospitals. Major components of dialysis revenue include the administration of EPO and other drugs as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents approximately 37% of operating revenues. Dialysis services are paid for primarily by Medicare and state Medicaid programs in accordance with rates established by CMS, and by other third party payors such as HMOs and health insurance carriers. Services provided to patients covered by third party insurance companies are normally reimbursed at rates higher than Medicare or Medicaid rates. Patients covered by employer group health plans convert to Medicare after a maximum of 33 months. As of year end 2002, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates were between $121 and $144 per treatment, or an overall average of $131 per treatment, excluding the administration of drugs. The majority of our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated reimbursement rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary rates. The commercial reimbursement rates are under continual pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the reimbursement rates generally decline substantially. Dialysis services revenues by payor type were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Percent of total dialysis revenue: Medicare 51 % 52 % 53 % Medicaid 5 5 5 56 57 58 HMOs, health insurance carriers and private patient payments 44 43 42 100 % 100 % 100 % The average dialysis revenue recognized per treatment (excluding prior years services revenue) was $291, $278 and $256 for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2002 was principally due to increases in our standard fee schedules (impacting non contract commercial revenue), changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, continued improvements in revenue capture, billing and collecting operations, and payor contracting. The increase in 2001 was principally due to continued improvements in revenue realization due to improved clinical operations and billing and collection processes, and a 2.4% increase in the Medicare composite reimbursement rates. The number of dialysis treatments increased 5.0% in 2002 and 6.3% in 2001, principally attributable to a non acquired annual growth rate of approximately 4.0% for both years. We continue to expect the non acquired growth rate to remain in the range of 3.0% to 5.0% through 2003. Acquisitions accounted for the balance of the increases in treatment volumes. The prior years services revenue of $22 million in 2001 related to cash recoveries associated with prior years services and resulted from improvements in the Companys billing and collecting operations. 24 Lab and other services As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements (Contingencies), our Florida based laboratory subsidiary has been under an ongoing third party carrier review for Medicare reimbursement claims since 1998. Prior to the third quarter 2002, no Medicare payments had been received since May 1998. Following a favorable ruling by an administrative law judge in June 2002 relating to review periods from January 1995 to March 1998, the carrier began releasing funds for lab services provided subsequent to May 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the carrier also released funds related to review periods from April 1998 through May 2001. During the second half of 2002, the carrier paid us a total of $68.8 million, representing approximately 70% of the total outstanding prior Medicare lab billings for the period from January 1995 through June 2002. Approximately $10 million of these collections related to 2002 lab services provided through June 2002. We have recognized prior period services Medicare lab revenue as payments have been received based on our belief that the cumulative recoveries do not exceed the aggregate amount that we will ultimately recover and retain upon final review and settlement of the Medicare billings. At this time we expect no significant additional Medicare lab payments relating to prior periods unless and until the dispute over the remaining disallowed claims are resolved in our favor. In addition to the prior period claims, the carrier also began processing billings for current period services in the third quarter of 2002. As a result, in addition to the $10 million of Medicare lab revenue related to the first half of 2002, we recognized approximately $11 million of current period Medicare lab revenue in the second half of 2002. Management fee income Management fee income represented less than 1% of total revenues for 2002 and 2001. Our fees are typically based on a percentage of revenue of the center that we manage and are established in the management contract. We managed 23 and 25 third party dialysis centers as of year end 2002 and 2001. Dialysis centers and lab expenses Operating expenses consist of costs and expenses specifically attributable to the operations of dialysis centers and labs, including direct labor, drugs, medical supplies and other patient care service and support costs. Dialysis centers and lab operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenue (excluding prior period services revenue) were 68%, 67% and 69% for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. On a per treatment basis, the operating expenses increased approximately $12 and $9 in 2002 and 2001. The increase in both years was principally due to higher labor and pharmaceutical costs, as well as revenue impacting changes in the mix of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Increases in revenue per treatment substantially offset these cost increases. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and labs and include expenses for corporate and regional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues (excluding prior period services revenue) were approximately 8.6%, 8.0% and 8.5% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In absolute dollars, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $25 million in 2002. The increase was principally due to higher labor costs, continued investments in infrastructure to develop new operating and billing systems, and higher legal costs relating to the laboratory and U.S. Attorneys reviews (see discussion of contingencies below) and other proactive compliance initiatives. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provision for 2002 and 2001, net of recoveries, was $27 million and a net recovery of $3 million. Before considering cash recoveries and excluding prior period services revenue, the provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately 1.8% of current operating revenues in 2002 as compared to 2.0% in 2001 and 3% in 2000. During 2002 and 2001, we realized recoveries of $5 million and $35 million associated with aged accounts receivables that had been reserved in 1999. The recoveries and lower provisions in 2002 and 2001 resulted from continued improvements that we made in our billing and collecting processes. 25 Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, and investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include changes in our business strategy and plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when an owned or third party dialysis business experiences deteriorating operating performance or liquidity problems. Goodwill is routinely assessed for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. Impairments and valuation adjustments for 2002 consisted of a net loss of approximately $1 million associated with continental U.S. operations and a net gain of approximately $1.3 million associated with the sale of our remaining non continental U.S. operations. Other income (loss) The net of other income and loss items were income of $5.8 million for 2002, $4.6 million for 2001 and a loss of $7.2 million in 2000. Interest income was $3.4 million, $3.2 million and $7.7 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2000, we had losses of $15.5 million related to the settlement of a securities lawsuit and the recognition of the foreign currency translation loss associated with the divestitures of the non continental U.S. operations. Debt expense Debt expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000 consisted of interest expense of approximately $69, $70 and $113 million respectively, and the amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $3 million in both 2002 and 2001 and $4 million in 2000. The slight reduction in interest expense in 2002 was the result of lower average interest rates offset by higher debt balances due to our debt restructuring and common stock purchases that occurred as part of our recapitalization plan, as discussed below. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2002 represented an effective tax rate of 41.0% as compared to 43.4% in 2001 and 62.2% in 2000. The reduction in the effective tax rate in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to overall lower state income tax rates, the elimination of book amortization not deductible for tax purposes and changes in tax valuation estimates. The high effective rate in 2000 resulted from the relatively low level of pre tax earnings in relation to significant permanent differences in 2000, including non deductible amortization and deferred tax valuation allowances. Extraordinary items In 2002, the extraordinary loss of $29.4 million, net of tax, related to our recapitalization plan which included retiring all our $225 million outstanding 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and extinguishing our then existing senior credit facilities, as discussed below. In 2001, the extraordinary gain of $1 million, net of tax, related to the write off of deferred financing costs offset by the accelerated recognition of deferred interest rate swap liquidation gains as a result of debt refinancing. In 2000, the extraordinary loss of $3.5 million, net of tax, related to the write off of deferred financing costs associated with an early extinguishment of debt. In July 2000, we restructured our revolving and term credit facilities. Projections for 2003 Our current projections for 2003, based on current conditions and trends, are for normal operating earnings before depreciation and amortization, debt expense and taxes, or EBITDA, to be in the range of $380 million to 26 $400 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks, among others, include those relating to possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, the concentration of profits generated from non governmental payors and from the administration of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, and the ongoing review by the United States Attorneys Office and the OIG. Additionally, the termination or restructuring of managed care contracts, medical director agreements or other arrangements may result in future impairments or otherwise negatively affect our operating results. We undertake no duty to update these projections, whether due to changes in current or expected trends, underlying market conditions, decisions of the United States Attorneys Office, the DOJ or the OIG in any pending or future review of our business, or otherwise. Liquidity and capital resources Cash flow from operations during 2002 amounted to $342 million which included $64 million of prior period services recoveries. The non operating cash flows were primarily associated with our recapitalization plan to restructure our debt and repurchase common stock, as discussed below, and a net investment of $121 million in acquisitions and new center developments, system infrastructure and other capital assets. During 2001 operating cash flow amounted to $265 million, which included $57 million of prior period services recoveries. Non operating cash flows for 2001 included a net $118 million for acquisitions and capital asset expenditures, and $20 million in stock repurchases. In the first quarter of 2002, we initiated a recapitalization plan to restructure our debt and repurchase common stock. In April 2002, we completed the initial phase of the recapitalization plan by retiring all of our $225 million outstanding 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 for $266 million. Concurrent with the retirement of this debt, we secured a new senior credit facility agreement in the amount of $1.115 billion. The excess of the consideration paid over the book value of the Senior Subordinated Notes and write off of deferred financing costs associated with extinguishing the existing senior credit facilities and the notes resulted in an extraordinary loss of $29.4 million, net of tax. In June 2002, we completed the next phase of the recapitalization plan with the repurchase of 16,682,337 shares of our common stock for approximately $402 million, or $24.10 per share, through a modified dutch auction tender offer. In May 2002, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional $225 million of common stock over the next eighteen months. As of December 31, 2002, 7,699,440 shares had been acquired for $172 million under this authorization. No additional purchases have been made under this authorization since December 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, stock repurchases, including 2,945,700 shares acquired prior to initiating the recapitalization plan, amounted to $642 million for 27,327,477 shares, for a composite average of $23.50 per share. The new senior credit facility secured during the second quarter of 2002 consists of a Term Loan A for $150 million, a Term Loan B for $850 million and a $115 million undrawn revolving credit facility, which includes up to $50 million available for letters of credit. During the second quarter of 2002, we borrowed all $850 million of the Term Loan B, and $842 million of the Term Loan B remained outstanding as of December 31, 2002. The Term Loan B bears interest equal to LIBOR plus 3.00%, which was a weighted average rate of 4.71% as of December 31, 2002. The interest rates under the Term Loan A, which was fully drawn during January 2003, and the revolving credit facility are equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.75% based on our leverage ratio. The current margin is 2.25% for an effective rate of 3.61%. The aggregate annual principal payments for the entire outstanding term credit facility range from $11 million to $51 million in years one through five, and $403 million in each of years six and seven, with the balance due not later than 2009. The new senior credit facility is secured by all our personal property and that of all our wholly owned subsidiaries. The new senior credit facility also contains financial and operating covenants including investment limitations. During the second quarter of 2001 we issued $225 million of 9% Senior Subordinated Notes and completed a refinancing of our senior credit facilities. The net proceeds of these transactions were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our then existing senior credit facilities. The new senior credit facilities 27 consisted of two term loans (totaling $114 million as of December 31, 2001) and a $150 million revolving credit facility (undrawn as of December 31, 2001). Total outstanding debt amounted to $820 million at December 31, 2001, a reduction of $156 million during the year. In 2000, we negotiated a major restructuring of the credit facility and we were able to reduce the total outstanding debt by over $482 million from our operating cash flows and the proceeds from divesting our non continental operations. The continental U.S. accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2002 and 2001 represented approximately 70 and 72 days of net revenue, net of bad debt provision. During 2002 we increased our capital expenditures by approximately $50 million over 2001, principally for new dialysis centers, relocations and expansions, and for major information technology systems and upgrades. We acquired a total of 11 centers and opened 19 new centers. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations over the next twelve months. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Nearly all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers, in the form of put options exercisable at the third party owners discretion. These put obligations require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow.

Our Florida based laboratory subsidiary is the subject of a third party carrier review of its Medicare reimbursement claims. The carrier has reviewed claims for six separate review periods. In 1998 the carrier issued 28 a formal overpayment determination in the amount of $5.6 million for the first review period (January 1995 to April 1996). The carrier also suspended all payments of Medicare claims from the laboratory beginning in May 1998. In 1999, the carrier issued a formal overpayment determination in the amount of $15.0 million for the second review period (May 1996 to March 1998). Subsequently, the carrier informed us that $16.1 million of the suspended claims for the third review period (April 1998 to August 1999), $11.6 million of the suspended claims for the fourth review period (August 1999 to May 2000), $2.9 million of the suspended claims for the fifth review period (June 2000 to December 2000) and $0.9 million of the suspended claims for the sixth review period (December 2000 through May 2001) were not properly supported by the prescribing physicians medical justification. The carriers allegations regarding improperly supported claims represented approximately 99%, 96%, 70%, 72%, 24% and 10%, respectively, of the tests the laboratory billed to Medicare for these six review periods. We have disputed each of the carriers determinations and have provided supporting documentation of our claims. In addition to the formal appeal processes with the carrier and a federal administrative law judge, we also pursued resolution of this matter through meetings with representatives of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and the Department of Justice, or DOJ. We initially met with the DOJ in February 2001, at which time the DOJ requested additional information, which we provided in September 2001. In June 2002 an administrative law judge ruled that the sampling procedures and extrapolations that the carrier used as the basis of its overpayment determinations for the first two review periods were invalid. This decision invalidated the carriers overpayment determinations for the first two review periods. The administrative law judges decision on the first two review periods does not apply to the remaining four review periods, as each review period is evaluated independently. Moreover, the carriers sampling procedures have varied from period to period, and the conclusions the judge arrived at with respect to the first two periods may not hold for the subsequent periods. The hearings before a carrier hearing officer for the third and fourth review periods are scheduled to take place in the second quarter of 2003. During 2000 we stopped accruing Medicare revenue from this laboratory because of the uncertainties regarding both the timing of resolution and the ultimate revenue valuations. Following the favorable ruling by the administrative law judge in 2002 related to the first two review periods covering January 1995 to March 1998, the carrier lifted the payment suspension and began making payments in July 2002 for lab services provided subsequent to May 2001. After making its determination with respect to the fifth and sixth review periods in December 2002, the carrier paid the additional amounts that it is not disputing for the second through sixth review periods. As of December 31, 2002, we had received a total of $68.8 million, which represented approximately 70% of the total outstanding Medicare lab billings for the period from January 1995 through June 2002. Approximately $10 million of these collections related to 2002 lab services provided through June 2002. These cash collections were recognized as revenue in the quarter received. We will continue to recognize Medicare lab revenue associated with prior periods as cash collections actually occur, to the extent that cumulative recoveries do not exceed the aggregate amount that management believes we will ultimately recover upon final review and settlement of disputed billings. In addition to processing prior period claims during the third quarter of 2002, the carrier also began processing billings for current period services on a timely basis. Based on these developments, we began recognizing estimated current period Medicare lab revenue in the third quarter of 2002. As a result, in addition to the $10 million of Medicare lab revenue related to the first half of 2002, we recognized approximately $11 million of current period Medicare lab revenue in the second half of 2002. The carrier is also currently conducting a study of the utilization of dialysis related laboratory services. During the study, the carrier has suspended all of its previously existing dialysis laboratory prepayment screens. The purpose of the study is to determine what ongoing program safeguards are appropriate. In its initial findings from the study, the carrier had determined that some of its prior prepayment screens were invalidating appropriate claims. We cannot determine what prepayment screens, post payment review procedures, 29 documentation requirements or other program safeguards the carrier may yet implement as a result of its study. The carrier has also informed us that any claims that it reimburses during the study period may also be subject to post payment review and refund if determined inappropriate. The Medicare carrier for our Minnesota laboratory is conducting a post payment review of Medicare reimbursement claims for the period January 1996 through December 1999. The scope of the review is similar to the review being conducted at our Florida laboratory. At this time, we are unable to determine how long it will take the carrier to complete this review. There is currently no overpayment determination or payment suspension with respect to the Minnesota laboratory. The DOJ also requested information with respect to this laboratory, which we have provided. Medicare revenues at the Minnesota laboratory, which was much smaller than the Florida laboratory, were approximately $15 million for the period under review. In November 2001, we closed the operations of this laboratory and combined them with our Florida laboratory. In February 2001 the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of our historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians. We cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the United States Attorneys Office. In May 2002, we received a subpoena from the Philadelphia office of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG. The subpoena requires an update to the information we provided in our response to the February 2001 request, and also seeks a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services, as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The subpoena covers the period from May 1996 to May 2002. We have provided the documents requested. This inquiry remains at an early stage. As it proceeds, the government could expand its areas of concern. If a court determines that there has been wrongdoing, the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these additional pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgements Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgements and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are generally applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts, impairments and valuation adjustments, and accounting for income taxes, are considered to be critical in evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgements and estimates. Revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts Revenues are recognized as services are provided to patients. Operating revenues consist primarily of reimbursement for dialysis and ancillary services to patients. A usual and customary fee schedule is maintained for our dialysis treatment and other patient services; however, actual collectible revenue is normally at a discount to the fee schedule. Medicare and Medicaid programs are billed at pre determined net realizable rates per 30 treatment that are established by statute or regulation. Most non governmental payors, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, but a contractual allowance is recorded to adjust to the expected net realizable revenue for services provided. Contractual allowances along with provisions for uncollectible accounts are estimated based upon credit risks of third party payors, contractual terms, inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes, regulatory compliance issues and historical collection experience. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in the Companys operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1 Auditing Health Care Third Party Revenues and Related Receivables. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received after considering possible retroactive adjustments that may be made as a result of the ongoing third party carrier review. Prior period services Medicare lab revenue is currently being recognized as cash collections actually occur, to the extent that the cumulative recoveries do not exceed the aggregate amount that we believe we will ultimately realize upon final review and settlement of the third party carriers review. Impairments of long lived assets We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as applicable. An impairment review is performed annually or whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements using current enacted tax laws. Deferred tax assets must be assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgement about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgements because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals We estimate variable compensation accruals monthly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain employee specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, awards and benefit plan contributions, are updated periodically due to changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results may vary due to the subjective nature of fulfilling employee specific and or corporate goals as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by the Companys Board of Directors. 31 Significant new accounting standards for 2002 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets became effective in 2002. Under SFAS No. 142, beginning in 2002 goodwill is no longer amortized, but is required to be assessed for possible valuation impairment as circumstances warrant and at least annually. An impairment charge must be recorded against current earnings to the extent that the book value of goodwill exceeds its fair value. We recognized no goodwill impairments upon transition to this standard. If this standard had been implemented at the beginning of 2000, amortization expense would have been reduced by $25 million and $27 million, net of tax, for 2001 and 2000. Net income and diluted net income per share would have been approximately $162 million or $1.76 per share and $41 million or $0.49 per share for 2001 and 2000, respectively. SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets became effective in 2002. SFAS No. 144 superceded SFAS No. 121 Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. SFAS No. 144 allows different approaches in cash flow estimation, and extends discontinued operations treatment, previously applied only to operating segments, to more discrete business components. The impairment model under SFAS No. 144 is otherwise largely unchanged from SFAS No. 121, and adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements. SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections will be effective for 2003. Under SFAS No. 145, gains or losses from extinguishment of debt will no longer be classified as extraordinary items, but will be included as a component of income from continuing operations. All comparable prior period extraordinary items will be reclassified for consistent presentation. Although the $29.4 million of extraordinary loss, net of tax, for 2002 will be reclassified in future financial statements as $49 million of ordinary expense before taxes, this classification change will have no impact on net income or net income per share. FASB Interpretation No. 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others was issued in November 2002. This Interpretation clarifies the requirements for a guarantors disclosures in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued and which remain outstanding. The Interpretation also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability for the fair value of an obligation undertaken by the guarantor at the inception of the guarantee, including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur. The disclosure requirements are currently effective, while the recognition and initial measurement provisions will apply to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We do not believe that these provisions will have a material impact on our financial statements. SFAS No. 148 Accounting for Stock based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, which was issued in December 2002, provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and also requires disclosures in interim as well as annual financial statements regarding our method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for this disclosure. 32 RISK FACTORS This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, earnings before depreciation and amortization, debt expense and taxes, and capital expenditures. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we do not intend to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment in which we operate, competitive activities and other business conditions. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include those set forth below. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. If the percentage of our collections at or near our billed prices declines, then our revenues, cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced. Approximately 44% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have private payors as the primary payor. A minority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at or near our billed prices, which are significantly higher than Medicare rates. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at lower rates but, in most cases, higher than Medicare rates. We believe that pressure from private payors to decrease the rates they pay us may increase. If the percentage of collections at or near our billed prices decreases significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and earnings. If the percentage of patients with insurance paying at or near our billed prices declines, then our revenues, cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced. Our revenue levels are sensitive to the mix of reimbursements from higher paying commercial plans to total reimbursements from all payor plans and program types. If there is a significant change in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans relative to plans that pay at lower rates, for example a reduction in the average number of patients under indemnity and PPO plans compared with the average number of patients under HMO plans and government programs, it would negatively impact our revenues, cash flows and earnings. If we are unable to renegotiate material contracts with managed care plans on acceptable terms, we may experience a decline in same center growth. We have contracts with some large managed care plans that include unfavorable terms. Although we are attempting to renegotiate the terms of these contracts, we cannot predict whether we will reach agreement on new terms or whether we will renew these contracts. As a result, we may lose numerous patients of these managed care plans and experience a decline in our same center growth, which would negatively impact our revenues. Changes in clinical practices and reimbursement rates or rules for EPO and other drugs could substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. The administration of EPO and other drugs accounts for approximately one third of our net operating revenues. Changes in physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices, changes in private and governmental reimbursement rates and rules, the introduction of new drugs and the conversion to alternate types of administration, for example from intravenous administration to subcutaneous or oral administration, that may also result in lower or less frequent dosages, could reduce our revenues and earnings from the administration of 33 EPO and other drugs. For example, some Medicare fiscal intermediaries are seeking to implement local medical review policies for EPO and vitamin D analogs that would effectively limit utilization of and reimbursement for these drugs. Future declines, or the lack of further increases, in Medicare reimbursement rates would reduce our net income and cash flows. Approximately 51% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have Medicare as their primary payor. The Medicare ESRD program reimburses us for dialysis and ancillary services at fixed rates. Unlike many other Medicare programs, the Medicare ESRD program does not provide for periodic inflation increases in reimbursement rates. Increases of 1.2% in 2000 and 2.4% in 2001 were the first increases in the composite rate since 1991, and were significantly less than the cumulative rate of inflation since 1991. There was no increase in the composite rate for 2002. Increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, have occurred and are expected to continue to occur with or without a compensating increase in reimbursement rates. We cannot predict the nature or extent of future rate changes, if any. To the extent these rates are not adjusted to keep pace with inflation, our net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. Future changes in the structure of, and reimbursement rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our operating earnings and cash flows. In legislation enacted in December 2000, Congress mandated government studies on whether: The Medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include an annual inflation increase this study was due July 2002, but has not yet been delivered to Congress; The Medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include additional services, such as laboratory and other diagnostic tests and the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals, in the composite rate this study was due July 2002, but has not yet been delivered to Congress; and Reimbursement for many of the outpatient prescription drugs that we administer to dialysis patients should be changed from the historic rate of 95% of the average wholesale price, or AWP. This study was delivered to Congress but Congress has not acted upon it. If Medicare began to include in its composite reimbursement rate any ancillary services that it currently reimburses separately, our revenue would decrease to the extent there was not a corresponding increase in that composite rate. In particular, Medicare revenue from EPO is approximately 25% of our total Medicare revenue. In January 2003, CMS implemented a new payment structure utilizing a single drug pricer for all drugs that Medicare reimburses, including many we administer. Based on the initial prices CMS has set, we do not expect our reimbursement under this single drug pricer in 2003 to differ materially from what it would have been under the AWP based reimbursement structure. We expect, however, that CMS will change the prices set under this single drug pricer in the future or make other changes to the payment structure for these drugs. If EPO were included in the composite rate, and if the composite rate were not increased sufficiently, our operating earnings and cash flows could decrease substantially. Reductions in current reimbursement rates for EPO or other outpatient prescription drugs would also reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Future declines in Medicaid reimbursement rates would reduce our net income and cash flows. Approximately 5% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues are generated from Medicaid payors. If state governments change Medicaid programs or the rates paid by those programs for our services, then our revenue and earnings may decline. Some of the states Medicaid programs have proposed eligibility changes or have announced that they are considering reductions in the rates for certain services. Any action to reduce the Medicaid coverage rules or reimbursement rates for dialysis and related services would adversely affect our revenue and earnings. 34 If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, our revenue and earnings would decline. If a significant number of physicians stop referring patients to our centers, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical directors of the centers. As a result, the primary referral source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center. If a medical director agreement terminates, whether before or at the end of its term, and a new medical director is appointed, it may negatively impact the former medical directors decision to treat his or her patients at our center. Additionally, the medical directors have no obligation to refer their patients to our centers. Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally five to ten years. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, we renewed the agreements with medical directors at 57 centers. In addition, as of December 31, 2002, there were 30 additional centers at which the medical director agreements required renewal on or before December 31, 2003. We also may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships in order to assure compliance with anti kickback and similar laws. These actions could negatively impact physicians decisions to extend their medical director agreements with us or to refer their patients to us. In addition, if the terms of an existing agreement were found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship, which could lead to the early termination of the agreement, or force the physician to stop referring patients to the centers. If the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel or our high level of personnel turnover continues, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses. We are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. This shortage limits our ability to expand our operations. We also have a high personnel turnover rate in our dialysis centers. Turnover has been the highest among our technicians, nurses and unit secretaries. Recent efforts to reduce this turnover may not succeed. If we are not successful, or if we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, our operations and our same center growth will be negatively impacted. Adverse developments with respect to EPO could materially reduce our net income and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients. Amgen is the sole supplier of EPO and may unilaterally decide to increase its price for EPO at any time. For example, Amgen unilaterally increased its base price for EPO by 3.9% in each of 2002, 2001 and 2000. Also, we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the same discount structure for EPO that we currently receive, or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of discounts within that structure as we have historically achieved. In addition, Amgen has developed a new product, Aranesp&reg;, that may replace EPO or reduce its use with dialysis patients. We cannot predict if or when Aranesp&reg; will be introduced to the U.S. dialysis market, what its cost and reimbursement structure will be, or how it may impact our revenues from EPO. Increases in the cost of EPO and the introduction of Aranesp&reg; could have a material adverse effect on our net income and cash flows. The pending federal review of some of our historical practices and third party carrier review of our laboratory subsidiary could result in substantial penalties against us. We are voluntarily cooperating with the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office and OIG in Philadelphia in a review of some of our practices, including billing and other operating procedures, financial 35 relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies, and the provision of pharmaceutical and other ancillary services. In addition, our Florida laboratory and our now closed Minnesota laboratory are each the subject of a third party carrier review of claims it has submitted for Medicare reimbursement. The DOJ has also requested and received information regarding these laboratories. We are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved, whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters, financial or otherwise. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations, federal and state anti kickback laws, and federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information. The regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers, including dialysis providers, has increased significantly in recent years. In addition, the frequency and intensity of Medicare certification surveys and inspections of dialysis centers has increased markedly since 2000. We endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with the anti kickback laws; however, the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations. In addition, our historic dependence on manual processes that vary widely across our network of dialysis centers exposes us to greater risk of errors in billing and other business processes. Due to regulatory considerations unique to each of these states, all of our dialysis operations in New York and part of our dialysis operations in New Jersey are conducted through privately owned companies to which we provide a broad range of administrative services. These operations account for approximately 7% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues. We believe that we have structured these operations to comply with the laws and regulations of these states, but we can give no assurances that they will not be challenged. If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations, we could suffer severe consequences, including: Mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses; Suspension of payments from government reimbursement programs; Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable reimbursement program requirements; Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government reimbursement programs; Loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate; Fines or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations, submission of false claims or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements and patient privacy law violations; and Claims for monetary damages from patients who believe their protected health information has been used or disclosed in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws. Our rollout of new information technology systems will significantly disrupt our billing and collection activity, may not work as planned and could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We will be continuing the rollout of new information technology systems and new processes to each of our dialysis centers over the next fifteen months. It is likely that this rollout will disrupt our billing and collection 36 activity and may cause other disruptions to our business operations, which may negatively impact our cash flows. Also, the new information systems may not work as planned or improve our billing and collection processes as expected. If they do not, we may have to spend substantial amounts to enhance or replace these systems. Provisions in our charter documents and compensation programs we have adopted may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests. Our charter documents include provisions which may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent, requiring 60 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our Board of Directors and granting our Board of Directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval, and a poison pill that would substantially dilute the interest sought by an acquirer that our board of directors does not approve. In addition, most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control. We have also adopted a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock options, which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. Based on the shares of our common stock outstanding and the market price of our stock on December 31, 2002, these cash bonuses would total approximately $53 million. These compensation programs may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay. These provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 37 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations, the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on these obligations as of December 31, 2002. For our debt obligations with variable interest rates, the rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of 2002. These rates are based on LIBOR plus a margin of 3.0%. Expected maturity date Total Fairvalue Averageinterestrate 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 125 $ 345 $ 470 $ 478 6.63 % Variable rate $ 8 $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 307 $ 507 $ 849 $ 849 5.10 % Our senior credit facility is based on a floating LIBOR interest rate plus a margin, which is reset periodically and can be locked in for a maximum of six months. As a result, our interest expense is subject to fluctuations as LIBOR interest rates change. One means of assessing exposure to interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (sometimes referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $3.5 million, $1.6 million and $4.7 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company does not currently use any derivative financial instruments to hedge against interest rate exposure.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this report. Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 (in thousands, except share data) Income statement data: Net operating revenues(1) $ 1,854,632 $ 1,650,753 $ 1,486,302 $ 1,445,351 $ 1,203,738 Total operating expenses(2) 1,463,300 1,332,761 1,311,587 1,509,333 1,068,825 Operating income (loss) 391,332 317,992 174,715 (63,982 ) 134,913 Other income (loss), net 5,790 4,644 (7,201 ) (1,895 ) 4,894 Debt expense(3) 71,636 72,438 116,637 110,797 84,003 Minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries (9,299 ) (9,260 ) (5,942 ) (5,152 ) (7,163 ) Income (loss) before income taxes, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 316,187 240,938 44,935 (181,826 ) 48,641 Income tax expense (benefit) 129,500 104,600 27,960 (34,570 ) 38,449 Income (loss) before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ 186,687 $ 136,338 $ 16,975 $ (147,256 ) $ 10,192 Net income (loss)(4) $ 157,329 $ 137,315 $ 13,485 $ (147,256 ) $ (9,448 ) Basic earnings (loss) per common share: Income (loss) before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ 2.60 $ 1.63 $ 0.21 $ (1.81 ) $ 0.12 Net income (loss)(4) $ 2.19 $ 1.64 $ 0.17 $ (1.81 ) $ (0.12 ) Diluted earnings (loss) per common share: Income (loss) before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ 2.28 $ 1.51 $ 0.20 $ (1.81 ) $ 0.12 Net income (loss)(4) $ 1.96 $ 1.52 $ 0.16 $ (1.81 ) $ (0.12 ) Ratio of earnings to fixed charges(5)(6) 4.35:1 3.63:1 1.32:1 See (6) 1.49:1 Balance sheet data: Working capital(7) $ 251,925 $ 175,983 $ 148,348 $ (1,043,796 ) $ 388,064 Total assets 1,775,693 1,662,683 1,596,632 2,056,718 1,911,619 Long term debt(8) 1,311,252 811,190 974,006 5,696 1,225,781 Shareholders equity(9) 70,264 503,637 349,368 326,404 473,864 (1) Net operating revenues include $58,778 in 2002 of prior years services revenue relating to Medicare lab revenue, and $22,000 in 2001 of prior years dialysis services revenue relating to cash settlements and collections in excess of prior estimates. (2) Total operating expenses include expense offsets from recoveries of $5,192 in 2002, and $35,220 in 2001 of accounts receivable reserved in 1999, a net gain for impairments and valuation adjustments of $380 in 2002 20 and net impairment losses of $4,556 in 2000, $139,805 in impairment and valuation losses in 1999 principally associated with the disposition of the Companys non continental U.S. operations and merger related costs of $78,188 in 1998. (3) Debt expense includes write offs of deferred financing costs of $1,192 in 2000 and $1,601 in 1999, and a loss on termination of interest rate swap agreements related to refinanced debt of $9,823 in 1998. (4) Net income (loss) includes an extraordinary loss of $29,358 ($0.41 per share basic, $0.32 per share diluted) in 2002 resulting from the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the retirement of the $225,000 outstanding 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011, an extraordinary gain of $977 ($0.01 per share) in 2001 relating to the write off of deferred financing costs and the associated accelerated swap liquidation gains resulting from debt refinancing, and extraordinary losses associated with early extinguishment of debt of $3,490 ($0.04 per share) in 2000 and $12,744 ($0.16 per share) in 1998. In 1998 we adopted AICPA Statement of Position No. 98 5 Reporting on the Costs for Start up Activities which requires that pre opening and organization costs be expensed as incurred. As a result, unamortized deferred pre opening and organizational costs of $6,896 ($0.08 per share) were written off as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in 1998. (5) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is computed by dividing fixed charges into earnings. Earnings for this purpose is defined as pretax income from operations adjusted by adding back fixed charges excluding interest capitalized during the period. Fixed charges are defined as the total of interest expense, amortization of financing costs, capitalized interest and the estimated interest component of rental expense on operating leases. (6) Due to our loss in 1999, the ratio coverage in 1999 was less than 1:1. We would have had to generate additional earnings of $182,535 to achieve a coverage of 1:1. (7) The working capital calculation as of December 31, 1999 includes long term debt of $1,425,610 that was potentially callable under covenant provisions. (8) Long term debt as of December 31, 1999 excludes $1,425,610 that was potentially callable under covenant provisions. (9) We repurchased 27,327,477 shares of common stock for $642,171 in 2002 and 888,700 shares of common stock for $20,360 in 2001. 21 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, and the risk factors set forth in this Form 10 K. These risks, among others, include those relating to possible reductions in private mix and private and government reimbursement rates, the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients and from ancillary services including the administration of pharmaceuticals, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, the ongoing review of the Companys Florida laboratory subsidiary by its Medicare carrier and the DOJ, the ongoing review by the US Attorneys Office and the OIG in Philadelphia and the Companys ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in our forward looking statements. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we have no current intention to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Results of operations Our operating results, excluding prior period service recoveries, for the year ended December 31, 2002 were in line with our projected range, with no significant unanticipated changes in dialysis revenue, expense trends or EBITDA, and no material changes in our general risk assessments. However, positive developments regarding disputed Medicare claims at our Florida laboratory have allowed us to recognize Medicare lab revenue for current and prior services beginning in the third quarter of 2002. The following is a summary of continental U. S. and non continental U.S. operating revenues and operating expenses: Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (dollars in millions) Operating revenues: Continental U.S. $ 1,849 100 % $ 1,636 99 % $ 1,412 95 % Non continental U.S. 6 15 1 % 74 5 % $ 1,855 100 % $ 1,651 100 % $ 1,486 100 % Operating expenses: Continental U.S. $ 1,458 100 % $ 1,317 99 % $ 1,234 94 % Non continental U.S. 6 16 1 % 73 6 % Impairment valuation adjustments 4 $ 1,464 100 % $ 1,333 100 % $ 1,311 100 % 22 The divestiture of our dialysis operations outside the continental United States was substantially completed during 2000, and the sale of our remaining centers in Puerto Rico was completed during the second quarter of 2002. Therefore, the non continental U.S. operating results are excluded from the revenue and cost trends discussed below. Continental operating results were as follows (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for non continental U.S. operating results): Continental U.S. Operations Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (dollars in millions) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 1,790 100 % $ 1,614 100 % $ 1,412 100 % Prior years services laboratory 59 Prior years services dialysis 22 Operating expenses: Dialysis centers and labs 1,212 68 % 1,087 67 % 973 69 % General and administrative 154 9 % 129 8 % 120 8 % Depreciation and amortization(a) 65 4 % 62 4 % 58 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts(b) 32 2 % 32 2 % 38 3 % 1,463 82 % 1,310 81 % 1,189 84 % Operating income current period services(a)(b) $ 327 18 % $ 304 19 % $ 223 16 % Impairments and valuation losses (gains): Continental U.S. operations $ 1 $ (1 ) $ 5 Non continental U.S. operations (1 ) 1 (1 ) $ $ $ 4 Dialysis treatments (000s) 5,975 5,690 5,354 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 19,090 18,185 17,066 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 291 $ 278 $ 256 (a) For comparison purposes, excludes goodwill amortization of $42 million in 2001, and $45 million in 2000. Goodwill is not amortized effective for 2002 per SFAS No. 142. (b) Excludes approximately $5 and $35 million of recoveries in 2002 and 2001 of amounts reserved in 1999. Operating income as presented also excludes $59 and $22 million of prior years services revenues in 2002 and 2001. Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with predicting third party reimbursements in the healthcare industry, our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Such risks and uncertainties are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1 Auditing Health Care Third Party Revenues and Related Receivables. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgement as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. The net operating revenues for continental U.S. operations of $1,790 million in 2002 and $1,614 million in 2001 represent annual increases of $176 million or 11% and $202 million or 14%, respectively. Approximately 50% and 60% of the increase in dialysis services revenue for 2002 and 2001 was attributable to increases in the average reimbursement rate per treatment and approximately 50% and 40% was due to an increase in the number of dialysis treatments. The increase in 2002 also included approximately $21 million of current year Medicare laboratory revenue. As discussed below, we had not recognized any Medicare laboratory revenue during 2001 due to the ongoing dispute with the third party carrier. 23 Dialysis services revenue Dialysis services revenue, excluding prior period service revenue, represented 97%, 98% and 97% of current operating revenues in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Lab, other and management fee income account for the balance of revenues. Dialysis services include outpatient center hemodialysis, which accounts for approximately 88% of total dialysis treatments, home dialysis, and inpatient hemodialysis with contracted hospitals. Major components of dialysis revenue include the administration of EPO and other drugs as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents approximately 37% of operating revenues. Dialysis services are paid for primarily by Medicare and state Medicaid programs in accordance with rates established by CMS, and by other third party payors such as HMOs and health insurance carriers. Services provided to patients covered by third party insurance companies are normally reimbursed at rates higher than Medicare or Medicaid rates. Patients covered by employer group health plans convert to Medicare after a maximum of 33 months. As of year end 2002, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates were between $121 and $144 per treatment, or an overall average of $131 per treatment, excluding the administration of drugs. The majority of our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated reimbursement rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary rates. The commercial reimbursement rates are under continual pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the reimbursement rates generally decline substantially. Dialysis services revenues by payor type were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Percent of total dialysis revenue: Medicare 51 % 52 % 53 % Medicaid 5 5 5 56 57 58 HMOs, health insurance carriers and private patient payments 44 43 42 100 % 100 % 100 % The average dialysis revenue recognized per treatment (excluding prior years services revenue) was $291, $278 and $256 for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2002 was principally due to increases in our standard fee schedules (impacting non contract commercial revenue), changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, continued improvements in revenue capture, billing and collecting operations, and payor contracting. The increase in 2001 was principally due to continued improvements in revenue realization due to improved clinical operations and billing and collection processes, and a 2.4% increase in the Medicare composite reimbursement rates. The number of dialysis treatments increased 5.0% in 2002 and 6.3% in 2001, principally attributable to a non acquired annual growth rate of approximately 4.0% for both years. We continue to expect the non acquired growth rate to remain in the range of 3.0% to 5.0% through 2003. Acquisitions accounted for the balance of the increases in treatment volumes. The prior years services revenue of $22 million in 2001 related to cash recoveries associated with prior years services and resulted from improvements in the Companys billing and collecting operations. 24 Lab and other services As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements (Contingencies), our Florida based laboratory subsidiary has been under an ongoing third party carrier review for Medicare reimbursement claims since 1998. Prior to the third quarter 2002, no Medicare payments had been received since May 1998. Following a favorable ruling by an administrative law judge in June 2002 relating to review periods from January 1995 to March 1998, the carrier began releasing funds for lab services provided subsequent to May 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the carrier also released funds related to review periods from April 1998 through May 2001. During the second half of 2002, the carrier paid us a total of $68.8 million, representing approximately 70% of the total outstanding prior Medicare lab billings for the period from January 1995 through June 2002. Approximately $10 million of these collections related to 2002 lab services provided through June 2002. We have recognized prior period services Medicare lab revenue as payments have been received based on our belief that the cumulative recoveries do not exceed the aggregate amount that we will ultimately recover and retain upon final review and settlement of the Medicare billings. At this time we expect no significant additional Medicare lab payments relating to prior periods unless and until the dispute over the remaining disallowed claims are resolved in our favor. In addition to the prior period claims, the carrier also began processing billings for current period services in the third quarter of 2002. As a result, in addition to the $10 million of Medicare lab revenue related to the first half of 2002, we recognized approximately $11 million of current period Medicare lab revenue in the second half of 2002. Management fee income Management fee income represented less than 1% of total revenues for 2002 and 2001. Our fees are typically based on a percentage of revenue of the center that we manage and are established in the management contract. We managed 23 and 25 third party dialysis centers as of year end 2002 and 2001. Dialysis centers and lab expenses Operating expenses consist of costs and expenses specifically attributable to the operations of dialysis centers and labs, including direct labor, drugs, medical supplies and other patient care service and support costs. Dialysis centers and lab operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenue (excluding prior period services revenue) were 68%, 67% and 69% for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. On a per treatment basis, the operating expenses increased approximately $12 and $9 in 2002 and 2001. The increase in both years was principally due to higher labor and pharmaceutical costs, as well as revenue impacting changes in the mix of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Increases in revenue per treatment substantially offset these cost increases. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and labs and include expenses for corporate and regional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues (excluding prior period services revenue) were approximately 8.6%, 8.0% and 8.5% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In absolute dollars, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $25 million in 2002. The increase was principally due to higher labor costs, continued investments in infrastructure to develop new operating and billing systems, and higher legal costs relating to the laboratory and U.S. Attorneys reviews (see discussion of contingencies below) and other proactive compliance initiatives. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provision for 2002 and 2001, net of recoveries, was $27 million and a net recovery of $3 million. Before considering cash recoveries and excluding prior period services revenue, the provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately 1.8% of current operating revenues in 2002 as compared to 2.0% in 2001 and 3% in 2000. During 2002 and 2001, we realized recoveries of $5 million and $35 million associated with aged accounts receivables that had been reserved in 1999. The recoveries and lower provisions in 2002 and 2001 resulted from continued improvements that we made in our billing and collecting processes. 25 Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, and investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include changes in our business strategy and plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when an owned or third party dialysis business experiences deteriorating operating performance or liquidity problems. Goodwill is routinely assessed for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. Impairments and valuation adjustments for 2002 consisted of a net loss of approximately $1 million associated with continental U.S. operations and a net gain of approximately $1.3 million associated with the sale of our remaining non continental U.S. operations. Other income (loss) The net of other income and loss items were income of $5.8 million for 2002, $4.6 million for 2001 and a loss of $7.2 million in 2000. Interest income was $3.4 million, $3.2 million and $7.7 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2000, we had losses of $15.5 million related to the settlement of a securities lawsuit and the recognition of the foreign currency translation loss associated with the divestitures of the non continental U.S. operations. Debt expense Debt expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000 consisted of interest expense of approximately $69, $70 and $113 million respectively, and the amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $3 million in both 2002 and 2001 and $4 million in 2000. The slight reduction in interest expense in 2002 was the result of lower average interest rates offset by higher debt balances due to our debt restructuring and common stock purchases that occurred as part of our recapitalization plan, as discussed below. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2002 represented an effective tax rate of 41.0% as compared to 43.4% in 2001 and 62.2% in 2000. The reduction in the effective tax rate in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to overall lower state income tax rates, the elimination of book amortization not deductible for tax purposes and changes in tax valuation estimates. The high effective rate in 2000 resulted from the relatively low level of pre tax earnings in relation to significant permanent differences in 2000, including non deductible amortization and deferred tax valuation allowances. Extraordinary items In 2002, the extraordinary loss of $29.4 million, net of tax, related to our recapitalization plan which included retiring all our $225 million outstanding 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and extinguishing our then existing senior credit facilities, as discussed below. In 2001, the extraordinary gain of $1 million, net of tax, related to the write off of deferred financing costs offset by the accelerated recognition of deferred interest rate swap liquidation gains as a result of debt refinancing. In 2000, the extraordinary loss of $3.5 million, net of tax, related to the write off of deferred financing costs associated with an early extinguishment of debt. In July 2000, we restructured our revolving and term credit facilities. Projections for 2003 Our current projections for 2003, based on current conditions and trends, are for normal operating earnings before depreciation and amortization, debt expense and taxes, or EBITDA, to be in the range of $380 million to 26 $400 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks, among others, include those relating to possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, the concentration of profits generated from non governmental payors and from the administration of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, and the ongoing review by the United States Attorneys Office and the OIG. Additionally, the termination or restructuring of managed care contracts, medical director agreements or other arrangements may result in future impairments or otherwise negatively affect our operating results. We undertake no duty to update these projections, whether due to changes in current or expected trends, underlying market conditions, decisions of the United States Attorneys Office, the DOJ or the OIG in any pending or future review of our business, or otherwise. Liquidity and capital resources Cash flow from operations during 2002 amounted to $342 million which included $64 million of prior period services recoveries. The non operating cash flows were primarily associated with our recapitalization plan to restructure our debt and repurchase common stock, as discussed below, and a net investment of $121 million in acquisitions and new center developments, system infrastructure and other capital assets. During 2001 operating cash flow amounted to $265 million, which included $57 million of prior period services recoveries. Non operating cash flows for 2001 included a net $118 million for acquisitions and capital asset expenditures, and $20 million in stock repurchases. In the first quarter of 2002, we initiated a recapitalization plan to restructure our debt and repurchase common stock. In April 2002, we completed the initial phase of the recapitalization plan by retiring all of our $225 million outstanding 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 for $266 million. Concurrent with the retirement of this debt, we secured a new senior credit facility agreement in the amount of $1.115 billion. The excess of the consideration paid over the book value of the Senior Subordinated Notes and write off of deferred financing costs associated with extinguishing the existing senior credit facilities and the notes resulted in an extraordinary loss of $29.4 million, net of tax. In June 2002, we completed the next phase of the recapitalization plan with the repurchase of 16,682,337 shares of our common stock for approximately $402 million, or $24.10 per share, through a modified dutch auction tender offer. In May 2002, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional $225 million of common stock over the next eighteen months. As of December 31, 2002, 7,699,440 shares had been acquired for $172 million under this authorization. No additional purchases have been made under this authorization since December 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, stock repurchases, including 2,945,700 shares acquired prior to initiating the recapitalization plan, amounted to $642 million for 27,327,477 shares, for a composite average of $23.50 per share. The new senior credit facility secured during the second quarter of 2002 consists of a Term Loan A for $150 million, a Term Loan B for $850 million and a $115 million undrawn revolving credit facility, which includes up to $50 million available for letters of credit. During the second quarter of 2002, we borrowed all $850 million of the Term Loan B, and $842 million of the Term Loan B remained outstanding as of December 31, 2002. The Term Loan B bears interest equal to LIBOR plus 3.00%, which was a weighted average rate of 4.71% as of December 31, 2002. The interest rates under the Term Loan A, which was fully drawn during January 2003, and the revolving credit facility are equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.75% based on our leverage ratio. The current margin is 2.25% for an effective rate of 3.61%. The aggregate annual principal payments for the entire outstanding term credit facility range from $11 million to $51 million in years one through five, and $403 million in each of years six and seven, with the balance due not later than 2009. The new senior credit facility is secured by all our personal property and that of all our wholly owned subsidiaries. The new senior credit facility also contains financial and operating covenants including investment limitations. During the second quarter of 2001 we issued $225 million of 9% Senior Subordinated Notes and completed a refinancing of our senior credit facilities. The net proceeds of these transactions were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our then existing senior credit facilities. The new senior credit facilities 27 consisted of two term loans (totaling $114 million as of December 31, 2001) and a $150 million revolving credit facility (undrawn as of December 31, 2001). Total outstanding debt amounted to $820 million at December 31, 2001, a reduction of $156 million during the year. In 2000, we negotiated a major restructuring of the credit facility and we were able to reduce the total outstanding debt by over $482 million from our operating cash flows and the proceeds from divesting our non continental operations. The continental U.S. accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2002 and 2001 represented approximately 70 and 72 days of net revenue, net of bad debt provision. During 2002 we increased our capital expenditures by approximately $50 million over 2001, principally for new dialysis centers, relocations and expansions, and for major information technology systems and upgrades. We acquired a total of 11 centers and opened 19 new centers. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations over the next twelve months. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Nearly all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers, in the form of put options exercisable at the third party owners discretion. These put obligations require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2002 (000s): Within One Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 7,285 $ 17,000 $ 438,437 $ 849,688 $ 1,312,410 Capital lease obligations 693 698 2,380 3,049 6,820 Operating leases 48,916 88,026 69,832 88,655 295,429 $ 56,894 $ 105,724 $ 510,649 $ 941,392 $ 1,614,659 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 7,418 $ 7,418 Acquisition of dialysis centers 33,000 $ 17,000 10,000 60,000 Working capital advances to managed and minority owned centers 5,000 5,000 $ 45,418 $ 17,000 $ 10,000 $ $ 72,418 Contingencies Health care provider revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements; and (5) claims for refunds from private payors. Our Florida based laboratory subsidiary is the subject of a third party carrier review of its Medicare reimbursement claims. The carrier has reviewed claims for six separate review periods. In 1998 the carrier issued 28 a formal overpayment determination in the amount of $5.6 million for the first review period (January 1995 to April 1996). The carrier also suspended all payments of Medicare claims from the laboratory beginning in May 1998. In 1999, the carrier issued a formal overpayment determination in the amount of $15.0 million for the second review period (May 1996 to March 1998). Subsequently, the carrier informed us that $16.1 million of the suspended claims for the third review period (April 1998 to August 1999), $11.6 million of the suspended claims for the fourth review period (August 1999 to May 2000), $2.9 million of the suspended claims for the fifth review period (June 2000 to December 2000) and $0.9 million of the suspended claims for the sixth review period (December 2000 through May 2001) were not properly supported by the prescribing physicians medical justification. The carriers allegations regarding improperly supported claims represented approximately 99%, 96%, 70%, 72%, 24% and 10%, respectively, of the tests the laboratory billed to Medicare for these six review periods. We have disputed each of the carriers determinations and have provided supporting documentation of our claims. In addition to the formal appeal processes with the carrier and a federal administrative law judge, we also pursued resolution of this matter through meetings with representatives of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and the Department of Justice, or DOJ. We initially met with the DOJ in February 2001, at which time the DOJ requested additional information, which we provided in September 2001. In June 2002 an administrative law judge ruled that the sampling procedures and extrapolations that the carrier used as the basis of its overpayment determinations for the first two review periods were invalid. This decision invalidated the carriers overpayment determinations for the first two review periods. The administrative law judges decision on the first two review periods does not apply to the remaining four review periods, as each review period is evaluated independently. Moreover, the carriers sampling procedures have varied from period to period, and the conclusions the judge arrived at with respect to the first two periods may not hold for the subsequent periods. The hearings before a carrier hearing officer for the third and fourth review periods are scheduled to take place in the second quarter of 2003. During 2000 we stopped accruing Medicare revenue from this laboratory because of the uncertainties regarding both the timing of resolution and the ultimate revenue valuations. Following the favorable ruling by the administrative law judge in 2002 related to the first two review periods covering January 1995 to March 1998, the carrier lifted the payment suspension and began making payments in July 2002 for lab services provided subsequent to May 2001. After making its determination with respect to the fifth and sixth review periods in December 2002, the carrier paid the additional amounts that it is not disputing for the second through sixth review periods. As of December 31, 2002, we had received a total of $68.8 million, which represented approximately 70% of the total outstanding Medicare lab billings for the period from January 1995 through June 2002. Approximately $10 million of these collections related to 2002 lab services provided through June 2002. These cash collections were recognized as revenue in the quarter received. We will continue to recognize Medicare lab revenue associated with prior periods as cash collections actually occur, to the extent that cumulative recoveries do not exceed the aggregate amount that management believes we will ultimately recover upon final review and settlement of disputed billings. In addition to processing prior period claims during the third quarter of 2002, the carrier also began processing billings for current period services on a timely basis. Based on these developments, we began recognizing estimated current period Medicare lab revenue in the third quarter of 2002. As a result, in addition to the $10 million of Medicare lab revenue related to the first half of 2002, we recognized approximately $11 million of current period Medicare lab revenue in the second half of 2002. The carrier is also currently conducting a study of the utilization of dialysis related laboratory services. During the study, the carrier has suspended all of its previously existing dialysis laboratory prepayment screens. The purpose of the study is to determine what ongoing program safeguards are appropriate. In its initial findings from the study, the carrier had determined that some of its prior prepayment screens were invalidating appropriate claims. We cannot determine what prepayment screens, post payment review procedures, 29 documentation requirements or other program safeguards the carrier may yet implement as a result of its study. The carrier has also informed us that any claims that it reimburses during the study period may also be subject to post payment review and refund if determined inappropriate. The Medicare carrier for our Minnesota laboratory is conducting a post payment review of Medicare reimbursement claims for the period January 1996 through December 1999. The scope of the review is similar to the review being conducted at our Florida laboratory. At this time, we are unable to determine how long it will take the carrier to complete this review. There is currently no overpayment determination or payment suspension with respect to the Minnesota laboratory. The DOJ also requested information with respect to this laboratory, which we have provided. Medicare revenues at the Minnesota laboratory, which was much smaller than the Florida laboratory, were approximately $15 million for the period under review. In November 2001, we closed the operations of this laboratory and combined them with our Florida laboratory. In February 2001 the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of our historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians. We cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the United States Attorneys Office. In May 2002, we received a subpoena from the Philadelphia office of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG. The subpoena requires an update to the information we provided in our response to the February 2001 request, and also seeks a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services, as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The subpoena covers the period from May 1996 to May 2002. We have provided the documents requested. This inquiry remains at an early stage. As it proceeds, the government could expand its areas of concern. If a court determines that there has been wrongdoing, the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these additional pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgements Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgements and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are generally applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts, impairments and valuation adjustments, and accounting for income taxes, are considered to be critical in evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgements and estimates. Revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts Revenues are recognized as services are provided to patients. Operating revenues consist primarily of reimbursement for dialysis and ancillary services to patients. A usual and customary fee schedule is maintained for our dialysis treatment and other patient services; however, actual collectible revenue is normally at a discount to the fee schedule. Medicare and Medicaid programs are billed at pre determined net realizable rates per 30 treatment that are established by statute or regulation. Most non governmental payors, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, but a contractual allowance is recorded to adjust to the expected net realizable revenue for services provided. Contractual allowances along with provisions for uncollectible accounts are estimated based upon credit risks of third party payors, contractual terms, inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes, regulatory compliance issues and historical collection experience. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in the Companys operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1 Auditing Health Care Third Party Revenues and Related Receivables. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received after considering possible retroactive adjustments that may be made as a result of the ongoing third party carrier review. Prior period services Medicare lab revenue is currently being recognized as cash collections actually occur, to the extent that the cumulative recoveries do not exceed the aggregate amount that we believe we will ultimately realize upon final review and settlement of the third party carriers review. Impairments of long lived assets We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as applicable. An impairment review is performed annually or whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements using current enacted tax laws. Deferred tax assets must be assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgement about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgements because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals We estimate variable compensation accruals monthly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain employee specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, awards and benefit plan contributions, are updated periodically due to changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results may vary due to the subjective nature of fulfilling employee specific and or corporate goals as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by the Companys Board of Directors. 31 Significant new accounting standards for 2002 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets became effective in 2002. Under SFAS No. 142, beginning in 2002 goodwill is no longer amortized, but is required to be assessed for possible valuation impairment as circumstances warrant and at least annually. An impairment charge must be recorded against current earnings to the extent that the book value of goodwill exceeds its fair value. We recognized no goodwill impairments upon transition to this standard. If this standard had been implemented at the beginning of 2000, amortization expense would have been reduced by $25 million and $27 million, net of tax, for 2001 and 2000. Net income and diluted net income per share would have been approximately $162 million or $1.76 per share and $41 million or $0.49 per share for 2001 and 2000, respectively. SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets became effective in 2002. SFAS No. 144 superceded SFAS No. 121 Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. SFAS No. 144 allows different approaches in cash flow estimation, and extends discontinued operations treatment, previously applied only to operating segments, to more discrete business components. The impairment model under SFAS No. 144 is otherwise largely unchanged from SFAS No. 121, and adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements. SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections will be effective for 2003. Under SFAS No. 145, gains or losses from extinguishment of debt will no longer be classified as extraordinary items, but will be included as a component of income from continuing operations. All comparable prior period extraordinary items will be reclassified for consistent presentation. Although the $29.4 million of extraordinary loss, net of tax, for 2002 will be reclassified in future financial statements as $49 million of ordinary expense before taxes, this classification change will have no impact on net income or net income per share. FASB Interpretation No. 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others was issued in November 2002. This Interpretation clarifies the requirements for a guarantors disclosures in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued and which remain outstanding. The Interpretation also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability for the fair value of an obligation undertaken by the guarantor at the inception of the guarantee, including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur. The disclosure requirements are currently effective, while the recognition and initial measurement provisions will apply to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We do not believe that these provisions will have a material impact on our financial statements. SFAS No. 148 Accounting for Stock based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, which was issued in December 2002, provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and also requires disclosures in interim as well as annual financial statements regarding our method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for this disclosure. 32 RISK FACTORS This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, earnings before depreciation and amortization, debt expense and taxes, and capital expenditures. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we do not intend to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment in which we operate, competitive activities and other business conditions. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include those set forth below. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. If the percentage of our collections at or near our billed prices declines, then our revenues, cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced. Approximately 44% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have private payors as the primary payor. A minority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at or near our billed prices, which are significantly higher than Medicare rates. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at lower rates but, in most cases, higher than Medicare rates. We believe that pressure from private payors to decrease the rates they pay us may increase. If the percentage of collections at or near our billed prices decreases significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and earnings. If the percentage of patients with insurance paying at or near our billed prices declines, then our revenues, cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced. Our revenue levels are sensitive to the mix of reimbursements from higher paying commercial plans to total reimbursements from all payor plans and program types. If there is a significant change in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans relative to plans that pay at lower rates, for example a reduction in the average number of patients under indemnity and PPO plans compared with the average number of patients under HMO plans and government programs, it would negatively impact our revenues, cash flows and earnings. If we are unable to renegotiate material contracts with managed care plans on acceptable terms, we may experience a decline in same center growth. We have contracts with some large managed care plans that include unfavorable terms. Although we are attempting to renegotiate the terms of these contracts, we cannot predict whether we will reach agreement on new terms or whether we will renew these contracts. As a result, we may lose numerous patients of these managed care plans and experience a decline in our same center growth, which would negatively impact our revenues. Changes in clinical practices and reimbursement rates or rules for EPO and other drugs could substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. The administration of EPO and other drugs accounts for approximately one third of our net operating revenues. Changes in physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices, changes in private and governmental reimbursement rates and rules, the introduction of new drugs and the conversion to alternate types of administration, for example from intravenous administration to subcutaneous or oral administration, that may also result in lower or less frequent dosages, could reduce our revenues and earnings from the administration of 33 EPO and other drugs. For example, some Medicare fiscal intermediaries are seeking to implement local medical review policies for EPO and vitamin D analogs that would effectively limit utilization of and reimbursement for these drugs. Future declines, or the lack of further increases, in Medicare reimbursement rates would reduce our net income and cash flows. Approximately 51% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have Medicare as their primary payor. The Medicare ESRD program reimburses us for dialysis and ancillary services at fixed rates. Unlike many other Medicare programs, the Medicare ESRD program does not provide for periodic inflation increases in reimbursement rates. Increases of 1.2% in 2000 and 2.4% in 2001 were the first increases in the composite rate since 1991, and were significantly less than the cumulative rate of inflation since 1991. There was no increase in the composite rate for 2002. Increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, have occurred and are expected to continue to occur with or without a compensating increase in reimbursement rates. We cannot predict the nature or extent of future rate changes, if any. To the extent these rates are not adjusted to keep pace with inflation, our net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. Future changes in the structure of, and reimbursement rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our operating earnings and cash flows. In legislation enacted in December 2000, Congress mandated government studies on whether: The Medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include an annual inflation increase this study was due July 2002, but has not yet been delivered to Congress; The Medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include additional services, such as laboratory and other diagnostic tests and the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals, in the composite rate this study was due July 2002, but has not yet been delivered to Congress; and Reimbursement for many of the outpatient prescription drugs that we administer to dialysis patients should be changed from the historic rate of 95% of the average wholesale price, or AWP. This study was delivered to Congress but Congress has not acted upon it. If Medicare began to include in its composite reimbursement rate any ancillary services that it currently reimburses separately, our revenue would decrease to the extent there was not a corresponding increase in that composite rate. In particular, Medicare revenue from EPO is approximately 25% of our total Medicare revenue. In January 2003, CMS implemented a new payment structure utilizing a single drug pricer for all drugs that Medicare reimburses, including many we administer. Based on the initial prices CMS has set, we do not expect our reimbursement under this single drug pricer in 2003 to differ materially from what it would have been under the AWP based reimbursement structure. We expect, however, that CMS will change the prices set under this single drug pricer in the future or make other changes to the payment structure for these drugs. If EPO were included in the composite rate, and if the composite rate were not increased sufficiently, our operating earnings and cash flows could decrease substantially. Reductions in current reimbursement rates for EPO or other outpatient prescription drugs would also reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Future declines in Medicaid reimbursement rates would reduce our net income and cash flows. Approximately 5% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues are generated from Medicaid payors. If state governments change Medicaid programs or the rates paid by those programs for our services, then our revenue and earnings may decline. Some of the states Medicaid programs have proposed eligibility changes or have announced that they are considering reductions in the rates for certain services. Any action to reduce the Medicaid coverage rules or reimbursement rates for dialysis and related services would adversely affect our revenue and earnings. 34 If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, our revenue and earnings would decline. If a significant number of physicians stop referring patients to our centers, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical directors of the centers. As a result, the primary referral source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center. If a medical director agreement terminates, whether before or at the end of its term, and a new medical director is appointed, it may negatively impact the former medical directors decision to treat his or her patients at our center. Additionally, the medical directors have no obligation to refer their patients to our centers. Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally five to ten years. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, we renewed the agreements with medical directors at 57 centers. In addition, as of December 31, 2002, there were 30 additional centers at which the medical director agreements required renewal on or before December 31, 2003. We also may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships in order to assure compliance with anti kickback and similar laws. These actions could negatively impact physicians decisions to extend their medical director agreements with us or to refer their patients to us. In addition, if the terms of an existing agreement were found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship, which could lead to the early termination of the agreement, or force the physician to stop referring patients to the centers. If the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel or our high level of personnel turnover continues, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses. We are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. This shortage limits our ability to expand our operations. We also have a high personnel turnover rate in our dialysis centers. Turnover has been the highest among our technicians, nurses and unit secretaries. Recent efforts to reduce this turnover may not succeed. If we are not successful, or if we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, our operations and our same center growth will be negatively impacted. Adverse developments with respect to EPO could materially reduce our net income and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients. Amgen is the sole supplier of EPO and may unilaterally decide to increase its price for EPO at any time. For example, Amgen unilaterally increased its base price for EPO by 3.9% in each of 2002, 2001 and 2000. Also, we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the same discount structure for EPO that we currently receive, or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of discounts within that structure as we have historically achieved. In addition, Amgen has developed a new product, Aranesp&reg;, that may replace EPO or reduce its use with dialysis patients. We cannot predict if or when Aranesp&reg; will be introduced to the U.S. dialysis market, what its cost and reimbursement structure will be, or how it may impact our revenues from EPO. Increases in the cost of EPO and the introduction of Aranesp&reg; could have a material adverse effect on our net income and cash flows. The pending federal review of some of our historical practices and third party carrier review of our laboratory subsidiary could result in substantial penalties against us. We are voluntarily cooperating with the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office and OIG in Philadelphia in a review of some of our practices, including billing and other operating procedures, financial 35 relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies, and the provision of pharmaceutical and other ancillary services. In addition, our Florida laboratory and our now closed Minnesota laboratory are each the subject of a third party carrier review of claims it has submitted for Medicare reimbursement. The DOJ has also requested and received information regarding these laboratories. We are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved, whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters, financial or otherwise. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations, federal and state anti kickback laws, and federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information. The regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers, including dialysis providers, has increased significantly in recent years. In addition, the frequency and intensity of Medicare certification surveys and inspections of dialysis centers has increased markedly since 2000. We endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with the anti kickback laws; however, the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations. In addition, our historic dependence on manual processes that vary widely across our network of dialysis centers exposes us to greater risk of errors in billing and other business processes. Due to regulatory considerations unique to each of these states, all of our dialysis operations in New York and part of our dialysis operations in New Jersey are conducted through privately owned companies to which we provide a broad range of administrative services. These operations account for approximately 7% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues. We believe that we have structured these operations to comply with the laws and regulations of these states, but we can give no assurances that they will not be challenged. If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations, we could suffer severe consequences, including: Mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses; Suspension of payments from government reimbursement programs; Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable reimbursement program requirements; Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government reimbursement programs; Loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate; Fines or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations, submission of false claims or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements and patient privacy law violations; and Claims for monetary damages from patients who believe their protected health information has been used or disclosed in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws. Our rollout of new information technology systems will significantly disrupt our billing and collection activity, may not work as planned and could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We will be continuing the rollout of new information technology systems and new processes to each of our dialysis centers over the next fifteen months. It is likely that this rollout will disrupt our billing and collection 36 activity and may cause other disruptions to our business operations, which may negatively impact our cash flows. Also, the new information systems may not work as planned or improve our billing and collection processes as expected. If they do not, we may have to spend substantial amounts to enhance or replace these systems. Provisions in our charter documents and compensation programs we have adopted may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests. Our charter documents include provisions which may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent, requiring 60 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our Board of Directors and granting our Board of Directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval, and a poison pill that would substantially dilute the interest sought by an acquirer that our board of directors does not approve. In addition, most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control. We have also adopted a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock options, which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. Based on the shares of our common stock outstanding and the market price of our stock on December 31, 2002, these cash bonuses would total approximately $53 million. These compensation programs may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay. These provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 37 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations, the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on these obligations as of December 31, 2002. For our debt obligations with variable interest rates, the rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of 2002. These rates are based on LIBOR plus a margin of 3.0%. Expected maturity date Total Fairvalue Averageinterestrate 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 125 $ 345 $ 470 $ 478 6.63 % Variable rate $ 8 $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 307 $ 507 $ 849 $ 849 5.10 % Our senior credit facility is based on a floating LIBOR interest rate plus a margin, which is reset periodically and can be locked in for a maximum of six months. As a result, our interest expense is subject to fluctuations as LIBOR interest rates change. One means of assessing exposure to interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (sometimes referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $3.5 million, $1.6 million and $4.7 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company does not currently use any derivative financial instruments to hedge against interest rate exposure. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, and the risk factors set forth in this Form 10 K. These risks, among others, include those relating to possible reductions in private mix and private and government reimbursement rates, the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients and from ancillary services including the administration of pharmaceuticals, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, the ongoing review of the Companys Florida laboratory subsidiary by its Medicare carrier and the DOJ, the ongoing review by the US Attorneys Office and the OIG in Philadelphia and the Companys ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in our forward looking statements. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we have no current intention to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Results of operations Our operating results, excluding prior period service recoveries, for the year ended December 31, 2002 were in line with our projected range, with no significant unanticipated changes in dialysis revenue, expense trends or EBITDA, and no material changes in our general risk assessments. However, positive developments regarding disputed Medicare claims at our Florida laboratory have allowed us to recognize Medicare lab revenue for current and prior services beginning in the third quarter of 2002. The following is a summary of continental U. S. and non continental U.S. operating revenues and operating expenses: Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (dollars in millions) Operating revenues: Continental U.S. $ 1,849 100 % $ 1,636 99 % $ 1,412 95 % Non continental U.S. 6 15 1 % 74 5 % $ 1,855 100 % $ 1,651 100 % $ 1,486 100 % Operating expenses: Continental U.S. $ 1,458 100 % $ 1,317 99 % $ 1,234 94 % Non continental U.S. 6 16 1 % 73 6 % Impairment valuation adjustments 4 $ 1,464 100 % $ 1,333 100 % $ 1,311 100 % 22 The divestiture of our dialysis operations outside the continental United States was substantially completed during 2000, and the sale of our remaining centers in Puerto Rico was completed during the second quarter of 2002. Therefore, the non continental U.S. operating results are excluded from the revenue and cost trends discussed below. Continental operating results were as follows (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for non continental U.S. operating results): Continental U.S. Operations Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (dollars in millions) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 1,790 100 % $ 1,614 100 % $ 1,412 100 % Prior years services laboratory 59 Prior years services dialysis 22 Operating expenses: Dialysis centers and labs 1,212 68 % 1,087 67 % 973 69 % General and administrative 154 9 % 129 8 % 120 8 % Depreciation and amortization(a) 65 4 % 62 4 % 58 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts(b) 32 2 % 32 2 % 38 3 % 1,463 82 % 1,310 81 % 1,189 84 % Operating income current period services(a)(b) $ 327 18 % $ 304 19 % $ 223 16 % Impairments and valuation losses (gains): Continental U.S. operations $ 1 $ (1 ) $ 5 Non continental U.S. operations (1 ) 1 (1 ) $ $ $ 4 Dialysis treatments (000s) 5,975 5,690 5,354 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 19,090 18,185 17,066 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 291 $ 278 $ 256 (a) For comparison purposes, excludes goodwill amortization of $42 million in 2001, and $45 million in 2000. Goodwill is not amortized effective for 2002 per SFAS No. 142. (b) Excludes approximately $5 and $35 million of recoveries in 2002 and 2001 of amounts reserved in 1999. Operating income as presented also excludes $59 and $22 million of prior years services revenues in 2002 and 2001. Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with predicting third party reimbursements in the healthcare industry, our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Such risks and uncertainties are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1 Auditing Health Care Third Party Revenues and Related Receivables. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgement as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. The net operating revenues for continental U.S. operations of $1,790 million in 2002 and $1,614 million in 2001 represent annual increases of $176 million or 11% and $202 million or 14%, respectively. Approximately 50% and 60% of the increase in dialysis services revenue for 2002 and 2001 was attributable to increases in the average reimbursement rate per treatment and approximately 50% and 40% was due to an increase in the number of dialysis treatments. The increase in 2002 also included approximately $21 million of current year Medicare laboratory revenue. As discussed below, we had not recognized any Medicare laboratory revenue during 2001 due to the ongoing dispute with the third party carrier. 23 Dialysis services revenue Dialysis services revenue, excluding prior period service revenue, represented 97%, 98% and 97% of current operating revenues in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Lab, other and management fee income account for the balance of revenues. Dialysis services include outpatient center hemodialysis, which accounts for approximately 88% of total dialysis treatments, home dialysis, and inpatient hemodialysis with contracted hospitals. Major components of dialysis revenue include the administration of EPO and other drugs as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents approximately 37% of operating revenues. Dialysis services are paid for primarily by Medicare and state Medicaid programs in accordance with rates established by CMS, and by other third party payors such as HMOs and health insurance carriers. Services provided to patients covered by third party insurance companies are normally reimbursed at rates higher than Medicare or Medicaid rates. Patients covered by employer group health plans convert to Medicare after a maximum of 33 months. As of year end 2002, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates were between $121 and $144 per treatment, or an overall average of $131 per treatment, excluding the administration of drugs. The majority of our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated reimbursement rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary rates. The commercial reimbursement rates are under continual pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the reimbursement rates generally decline substantially. Dialysis services revenues by payor type were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Percent of total dialysis revenue: Medicare 51 % 52 % 53 % Medicaid 5 5 5 56 57 58 HMOs, health insurance carriers and private patient payments 44 43 42 100 % 100 % 100 % The average dialysis revenue recognized per treatment (excluding prior years services revenue) was $291, $278 and $256 for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2002 was principally due to increases in our standard fee schedules (impacting non contract commercial revenue), changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, continued improvements in revenue capture, billing and collecting operations, and payor contracting. The increase in 2001 was principally due to continued improvements in revenue realization due to improved clinical operations and billing and collection processes, and a 2.4% increase in the Medicare composite reimbursement rates. The number of dialysis treatments increased 5.0% in 2002 and 6.3% in 2001, principally attributable to a non acquired annual growth rate of approximately 4.0% for both years. We continue to expect the non acquired growth rate to remain in the range of 3.0% to 5.0% through 2003. Acquisitions accounted for the balance of the increases in treatment volumes. The prior years services revenue of $22 million in 2001 related to cash recoveries associated with prior years services and resulted from improvements in the Companys billing and collecting operations. 24 Lab and other services As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements (Contingencies), our Florida based laboratory subsidiary has been under an ongoing third party carrier review for Medicare reimbursement claims since 1998. Prior to the third quarter 2002, no Medicare payments had been received since May 1998. Following a favorable ruling by an administrative law judge in June 2002 relating to review periods from January 1995 to March 1998, the carrier began releasing funds for lab services provided subsequent to May 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the carrier also released funds related to review periods from April 1998 through May 2001. During the second half of 2002, the carrier paid us a total of $68.8 million, representing approximately 70% of the total outstanding prior Medicare lab billings for the period from January 1995 through June 2002. Approximately $10 million of these collections related to 2002 lab services provided through June 2002. We have recognized prior period services Medicare lab revenue as payments have been received based on our belief that the cumulative recoveries do not exceed the aggregate amount that we will ultimately recover and retain upon final review and settlement of the Medicare billings. At this time we expect no significant additional Medicare lab payments relating to prior periods unless and until the dispute over the remaining disallowed claims are resolved in our favor. In addition to the prior period claims, the carrier also began processing billings for current period services in the third quarter of 2002. As a result, in addition to the $10 million of Medicare lab revenue related to the first half of 2002, we recognized approximately $11 million of current period Medicare lab revenue in the second half of 2002. Management fee income Management fee income represented less than 1% of total revenues for 2002 and 2001. Our fees are typically based on a percentage of revenue of the center that we manage and are established in the management contract. We managed 23 and 25 third party dialysis centers as of year end 2002 and 2001. Dialysis centers and lab expenses Operating expenses consist of costs and expenses specifically attributable to the operations of dialysis centers and labs, including direct labor, drugs, medical supplies and other patient care service and support costs. Dialysis centers and lab operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenue (excluding prior period services revenue) were 68%, 67% and 69% for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. On a per treatment basis, the operating expenses increased approximately $12 and $9 in 2002 and 2001. The increase in both years was principally due to higher labor and pharmaceutical costs, as well as revenue impacting changes in the mix of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Increases in revenue per treatment substantially offset these cost increases. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and labs and include expenses for corporate and regional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues (excluding prior period services revenue) were approximately 8.6%, 8.0% and 8.5% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In absolute dollars, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $25 million in 2002. The increase was principally due to higher labor costs, continued investments in infrastructure to develop new operating and billing systems, and higher legal costs relating to the laboratory and U.S. Attorneys reviews (see discussion of contingencies below) and other proactive compliance initiatives. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provision for 2002 and 2001, net of recoveries, was $27 million and a net recovery of $3 million. Before considering cash recoveries and excluding prior period services revenue, the provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately 1.8% of current operating revenues in 2002 as compared to 2.0% in 2001 and 3% in 2000. During 2002 and 2001, we realized recoveries of $5 million and $35 million associated with aged accounts receivables that had been reserved in 1999. The recoveries and lower provisions in 2002 and 2001 resulted from continued improvements that we made in our billing and collecting processes. 25 Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, and investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include changes in our business strategy and plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when an owned or third party dialysis business experiences deteriorating operating performance or liquidity problems. Goodwill is routinely assessed for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. Impairments and valuation adjustments for 2002 consisted of a net loss of approximately $1 million associated with continental U.S. operations and a net gain of approximately $1.3 million associated with the sale of our remaining non continental U.S. operations. Other income (loss) The net of other income and loss items were income of $5.8 million for 2002, $4.6 million for 2001 and a loss of $7.2 million in 2000. Interest income was $3.4 million, $3.2 million and $7.7 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2000, we had losses of $15.5 million related to the settlement of a securities lawsuit and the recognition of the foreign currency translation loss associated with the divestitures of the non continental U.S. operations. Debt expense Debt expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000 consisted of interest expense of approximately $69, $70 and $113 million respectively, and the amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $3 million in both 2002 and 2001 and $4 million in 2000. The slight reduction in interest expense in 2002 was the result of lower average interest rates offset by higher debt balances due to our debt restructuring and common stock purchases that occurred as part of our recapitalization plan, as discussed below. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2002 represented an effective tax rate of 41.0% as compared to 43.4% in 2001 and 62.2% in 2000. The reduction in the effective tax rate in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to overall lower state income tax rates, the elimination of book amortization not deductible for tax purposes and changes in tax valuation estimates. The high effective rate in 2000 resulted from the relatively low level of pre tax earnings in relation to significant permanent differences in 2000, including non deductible amortization and deferred tax valuation allowances. Extraordinary items In 2002, the extraordinary loss of $29.4 million, net of tax, related to our recapitalization plan which included retiring all our $225 million outstanding 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and extinguishing our then existing senior credit facilities, as discussed below. In 2001, the extraordinary gain of $1 million, net of tax, related to the write off of deferred financing costs offset by the accelerated recognition of deferred interest rate swap liquidation gains as a result of debt refinancing. In 2000, the extraordinary loss of $3.5 million, net of tax, related to the write off of deferred financing costs associated with an early extinguishment of debt. In July 2000, we restructured our revolving and term credit facilities. Projections for 2003 Our current projections for 2003, based on current conditions and trends, are for normal operating earnings before depreciation and amortization, debt expense and taxes, or EBITDA, to be in the range of $380 million to 26 $400 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks, among others, include those relating to possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, the concentration of profits generated from non governmental payors and from the administration of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, and the ongoing review by the United States Attorneys Office and the OIG. Additionally, the termination or restructuring of managed care contracts, medical director agreements or other arrangements may result in future impairments or otherwise negatively affect our operating results. We undertake no duty to update these projections, whether due to changes in current or expected trends, underlying market conditions, decisions of the United States Attorneys Office, the DOJ or the OIG in any pending or future review of our business, or otherwise. Liquidity and capital resources Cash flow from operations during 2002 amounted to $342 million which included $64 million of prior period services recoveries. The non operating cash flows were primarily associated with our recapitalization plan to restructure our debt and repurchase common stock, as discussed below, and a net investment of $121 million in acquisitions and new center developments, system infrastructure and other capital assets. During 2001 operating cash flow amounted to $265 million, which included $57 million of prior period services recoveries. Non operating cash flows for 2001 included a net $118 million for acquisitions and capital asset expenditures, and $20 million in stock repurchases. In the first quarter of 2002, we initiated a recapitalization plan to restructure our debt and repurchase common stock. In April 2002, we completed the initial phase of the recapitalization plan by retiring all of our $225 million outstanding 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 for $266 million. Concurrent with the retirement of this debt, we secured a new senior credit facility agreement in the amount of $1.115 billion. The excess of the consideration paid over the book value of the Senior Subordinated Notes and write off of deferred financing costs associated with extinguishing the existing senior credit facilities and the notes resulted in an extraordinary loss of $29.4 million, net of tax. In June 2002, we completed the next phase of the recapitalization plan with the repurchase of 16,682,337 shares of our common stock for approximately $402 million, or $24.10 per share, through a modified dutch auction tender offer. In May 2002, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional $225 million of common stock over the next eighteen months. As of December 31, 2002, 7,699,440 shares had been acquired for $172 million under this authorization. No additional purchases have been made under this authorization since December 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, stock repurchases, including 2,945,700 shares acquired prior to initiating the recapitalization plan, amounted to $642 million for 27,327,477 shares, for a composite average of $23.50 per share. The new senior credit facility secured during the second quarter of 2002 consists of a Term Loan A for $150 million, a Term Loan B for $850 million and a $115 million undrawn revolving credit facility, which includes up to $50 million available for letters of credit. During the second quarter of 2002, we borrowed all $850 million of the Term Loan B, and $842 million of the Term Loan B remained outstanding as of December 31, 2002. The Term Loan B bears interest equal to LIBOR plus 3.00%, which was a weighted average rate of 4.71% as of December 31, 2002. The interest rates under the Term Loan A, which was fully drawn during January 2003, and the revolving credit facility are equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.75% based on our leverage ratio. The current margin is 2.25% for an effective rate of 3.61%. The aggregate annual principal payments for the entire outstanding term credit facility range from $11 million to $51 million in years one through five, and $403 million in each of years six and seven, with the balance due not later than 2009. The new senior credit facility is secured by all our personal property and that of all our wholly owned subsidiaries. The new senior credit facility also contains financial and operating covenants including investment limitations. During the second quarter of 2001 we issued $225 million of 9% Senior Subordinated Notes and completed a refinancing of our senior credit facilities. The net proceeds of these transactions were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our then existing senior credit facilities. The new senior credit facilities 27 consisted of two term loans (totaling $114 million as of December 31, 2001) and a $150 million revolving credit facility (undrawn as of December 31, 2001). Total outstanding debt amounted to $820 million at December 31, 2001, a reduction of $156 million during the year. In 2000, we negotiated a major restructuring of the credit facility and we were able to reduce the total outstanding debt by over $482 million from our operating cash flows and the proceeds from divesting our non continental operations. The continental U.S. accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2002 and 2001 represented approximately 70 and 72 days of net revenue, net of bad debt provision. During 2002 we increased our capital expenditures by approximately $50 million over 2001, principally for new dialysis centers, relocations and expansions, and for major information technology systems and upgrades. We acquired a total of 11 centers and opened 19 new centers. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations over the next twelve months. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Nearly all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers, in the form of put options exercisable at the third party owners discretion. These put obligations require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2002 (000s): Within One Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 7,285 $ 17,000 $ 438,437 $ 849,688 $ 1,312,410 Capital lease obligations 693 698 2,380 3,049 6,820 Operating leases 48,916 88,026 69,832 88,655 295,429 $ 56,894 $ 105,724 $ 510,649 $ 941,392 $ 1,614,659 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 7,418 $ 7,418 Acquisition of dialysis centers 33,000 $ 17,000 10,000 60,000 Working capital advances to managed and minority owned centers 5,000 5,000 $ 45,418 $ 17,000 $ 10,000 $ $ 72,418 Contingencies Health care provider revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements; and (5) claims for refunds from private payors. Our Florida based laboratory subsidiary is the subject of a third party carrier review of its Medicare reimbursement claims. The carrier has reviewed claims for six separate review periods. In 1998 the carrier issued 28 a formal overpayment determination in the amount of $5.6 million for the first review period (January 1995 to April 1996). The carrier also suspended all payments of Medicare claims from the laboratory beginning in May 1998. In 1999, the carrier issued a formal overpayment determination in the amount of $15.0 million for the second review period (May 1996 to March 1998). Subsequently, the carrier informed us that $16.1 million of the suspended claims for the third review period (April 1998 to August 1999), $11.6 million of the suspended claims for the fourth review period (August 1999 to May 2000), $2.9 million of the suspended claims for the fifth review period (June 2000 to December 2000) and $0.9 million of the suspended claims for the sixth review period (December 2000 through May 2001) were not properly supported by the prescribing physicians medical justification. The carriers allegations regarding improperly supported claims represented approximately 99%, 96%, 70%, 72%, 24% and 10%, respectively, of the tests the laboratory billed to Medicare for these six review periods. We have disputed each of the carriers determinations and have provided supporting documentation of our claims. In addition to the formal appeal processes with the carrier and a federal administrative law judge, we also pursued resolution of this matter through meetings with representatives of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and the Department of Justice, or DOJ. We initially met with the DOJ in February 2001, at which time the DOJ requested additional information, which we provided in September 2001. In June 2002 an administrative law judge ruled that the sampling procedures and extrapolations that the carrier used as the basis of its overpayment determinations for the first two review periods were invalid. This decision invalidated the carriers overpayment determinations for the first two review periods. The administrative law judges decision on the first two review periods does not apply to the remaining four review periods, as each review period is evaluated independently. Moreover, the carriers sampling procedures have varied from period to period, and the conclusions the judge arrived at with respect to the first two periods may not hold for the subsequent periods. The hearings before a carrier hearing officer for the third and fourth review periods are scheduled to take place in the second quarter of 2003. During 2000 we stopped accruing Medicare revenue from this laboratory because of the uncertainties regarding both the timing of resolution and the ultimate revenue valuations. Following the favorable ruling by the administrative law judge in 2002 related to the first two review periods covering January 1995 to March 1998, the carrier lifted the payment suspension and began making payments in July 2002 for lab services provided subsequent to May 2001. After making its determination with respect to the fifth and sixth review periods in December 2002, the carrier paid the additional amounts that it is not disputing for the second through sixth review periods. As of December 31, 2002, we had received a total of $68.8 million, which represented approximately 70% of the total outstanding Medicare lab billings for the period from January 1995 through June 2002. Approximately $10 million of these collections related to 2002 lab services provided through June 2002. These cash collections were recognized as revenue in the quarter received. We will continue to recognize Medicare lab revenue associated with prior periods as cash collections actually occur, to the extent that cumulative recoveries do not exceed the aggregate amount that management believes we will ultimately recover upon final review and settlement of disputed billings. In addition to processing prior period claims during the third quarter of 2002, the carrier also began processing billings for current period services on a timely basis. Based on these developments, we began recognizing estimated current period Medicare lab revenue in the third quarter of 2002. As a result, in addition to the $10 million of Medicare lab revenue related to the first half of 2002, we recognized approximately $11 million of current period Medicare lab revenue in the second half of 2002. The carrier is also currently conducting a study of the utilization of dialysis related laboratory services. During the study, the carrier has suspended all of its previously existing dialysis laboratory prepayment screens. The purpose of the study is to determine what ongoing program safeguards are appropriate. In its initial findings from the study, the carrier had determined that some of its prior prepayment screens were invalidating appropriate claims. We cannot determine what prepayment screens, post payment review procedures, 29 documentation requirements or other program safeguards the carrier may yet implement as a result of its study. The carrier has also informed us that any claims that it reimburses during the study period may also be subject to post payment review and refund if determined inappropriate. The Medicare carrier for our Minnesota laboratory is conducting a post payment review of Medicare reimbursement claims for the period January 1996 through December 1999. The scope of the review is similar to the review being conducted at our Florida laboratory. At this time, we are unable to determine how long it will take the carrier to complete this review. There is currently no overpayment determination or payment suspension with respect to the Minnesota laboratory. The DOJ also requested information with respect to this laboratory, which we have provided. Medicare revenues at the Minnesota laboratory, which was much smaller than the Florida laboratory, were approximately $15 million for the period under review. In November 2001, we closed the operations of this laboratory and combined them with our Florida laboratory. In February 2001 the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of our historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians. We cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the United States Attorneys Office. In May 2002, we received a subpoena from the Philadelphia office of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG. The subpoena requires an update to the information we provided in our response to the February 2001 request, and also seeks a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services, as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The subpoena covers the period from May 1996 to May 2002. We have provided the documents requested. This inquiry remains at an early stage. As it proceeds, the government could expand its areas of concern. If a court determines that there has been wrongdoing, the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these additional pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgements Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgements and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are generally applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts, impairments and valuation adjustments, and accounting for income taxes, are considered to be critical in evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgements and estimates. Revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts Revenues are recognized as services are provided to patients. Operating revenues consist primarily of reimbursement for dialysis and ancillary services to patients. A usual and customary fee schedule is maintained for our dialysis treatment and other patient services; however, actual collectible revenue is normally at a discount to the fee schedule. Medicare and Medicaid programs are billed at pre determined net realizable rates per 30 treatment that are established by statute or regulation. Most non governmental payors, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, but a contractual allowance is recorded to adjust to the expected net realizable revenue for services provided. Contractual allowances along with provisions for uncollectible accounts are estimated based upon credit risks of third party payors, contractual terms, inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes, regulatory compliance issues and historical collection experience. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in the Companys operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1 Auditing Health Care Third Party Revenues and Related Receivables. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received after considering possible retroactive adjustments that may be made as a result of the ongoing third party carrier review. Prior period services Medicare lab revenue is currently being recognized as cash collections actually occur, to the extent that the cumulative recoveries do not exceed the aggregate amount that we believe we will ultimately realize upon final review and settlement of the third party carriers review. Impairments of long lived assets We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as applicable. An impairment review is performed annually or whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements using current enacted tax laws. Deferred tax assets must be assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgement about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgements because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals We estimate variable compensation accruals monthly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain employee specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, awards and benefit plan contributions, are updated periodically due to changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results may vary due to the subjective nature of fulfilling employee specific and or corporate goals as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by the Companys Board of Directors. 31 Significant new accounting standards for 2002 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets became effective in 2002. Under SFAS No. 142, beginning in 2002 goodwill is no longer amortized, but is required to be assessed for possible valuation impairment as circumstances warrant and at least annually. An impairment charge must be recorded against current earnings to the extent that the book value of goodwill exceeds its fair value. We recognized no goodwill impairments upon transition to this standard. If this standard had been implemented at the beginning of 2000, amortization expense would have been reduced by $25 million and $27 million, net of tax, for 2001 and 2000. Net income and diluted net income per share would have been approximately $162 million or $1.76 per share and $41 million or $0.49 per share for 2001 and 2000, respectively. SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets became effective in 2002. SFAS No. 144 superceded SFAS No. 121 Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. SFAS No. 144 allows different approaches in cash flow estimation, and extends discontinued operations treatment, previously applied only to operating segments, to more discrete business components. The impairment model under SFAS No. 144 is otherwise largely unchanged from SFAS No. 121, and adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements. SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections will be effective for 2003. Under SFAS No. 145, gains or losses from extinguishment of debt will no longer be classified as extraordinary items, but will be included as a component of income from continuing operations. All comparable prior period extraordinary items will be reclassified for consistent presentation. Although the $29.4 million of extraordinary loss, net of tax, for 2002 will be reclassified in future financial statements as $49 million of ordinary expense before taxes, this classification change will have no impact on net income or net income per share. FASB Interpretation No. 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others was issued in November 2002. This Interpretation clarifies the requirements for a guarantors disclosures in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued and which remain outstanding. The Interpretation also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability for the fair value of an obligation undertaken by the guarantor at the inception of the guarantee, including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur. The disclosure requirements are currently effective, while the recognition and initial measurement provisions will apply to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We do not believe that these provisions will have a material impact on our financial statements. SFAS No. 148 Accounting for Stock based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, which was issued in December 2002, provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and also requires disclosures in interim as well as annual financial statements regarding our method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for this disclosure. 32 RISK FACTORS This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, earnings before depreciation and amortization, debt expense and taxes, and capital expenditures. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we do not intend to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment in which we operate, competitive activities and other business conditions. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include those set forth below. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. If the percentage of our collections at or near our billed prices declines, then our revenues, cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced. Approximately 44% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have private payors as the primary payor. A minority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at or near our billed prices, which are significantly higher than Medicare rates. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at lower rates but, in most cases, higher than Medicare rates. We believe that pressure from private payors to decrease the rates they pay us may increase. If the percentage of collections at or near our billed prices decreases significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and earnings. If the percentage of patients with insurance paying at or near our billed prices declines, then our revenues, cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced. Our revenue levels are sensitive to the mix of reimbursements from higher paying commercial plans to total reimbursements from all payor plans and program types. If there is a significant change in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans relative to plans that pay at lower rates, for example a reduction in the average number of patients under indemnity and PPO plans compared with the average number of patients under HMO plans and government programs, it would negatively impact our revenues, cash flows and earnings. If we are unable to renegotiate material contracts with managed care plans on acceptable terms, we may experience a decline in same center growth. We have contracts with some large managed care plans that include unfavorable terms. Although we are attempting to renegotiate the terms of these contracts, we cannot predict whether we will reach agreement on new terms or whether we will renew these contracts. As a result, we may lose numerous patients of these managed care plans and experience a decline in our same center growth, which would negatively impact our revenues. Changes in clinical practices and reimbursement rates or rules for EPO and other drugs could substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. The administration of EPO and other drugs accounts for approximately one third of our net operating revenues. Changes in physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices, changes in private and governmental reimbursement rates and rules, the introduction of new drugs and the conversion to alternate types of administration, for example from intravenous administration to subcutaneous or oral administration, that may also result in lower or less frequent dosages, could reduce our revenues and earnings from the administration of 33 EPO and other drugs. For example, some Medicare fiscal intermediaries are seeking to implement local medical review policies for EPO and vitamin D analogs that would effectively limit utilization of and reimbursement for these drugs. Future declines, or the lack of further increases, in Medicare reimbursement rates would reduce our net income and cash flows. Approximately 51% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have Medicare as their primary payor. The Medicare ESRD program reimburses us for dialysis and ancillary services at fixed rates. Unlike many other Medicare programs, the Medicare ESRD program does not provide for periodic inflation increases in reimbursement rates. Increases of 1.2% in 2000 and 2.4% in 2001 were the first increases in the composite rate since 1991, and were significantly less than the cumulative rate of inflation since 1991. There was no increase in the composite rate for 2002. Increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, have occurred and are expected to continue to occur with or without a compensating increase in reimbursement rates. We cannot predict the nature or extent of future rate changes, if any. To the extent these rates are not adjusted to keep pace with inflation, our net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. Future changes in the structure of, and reimbursement rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our operating earnings and cash flows. In legislation enacted in December 2000, Congress mandated government studies on whether: The Medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include an annual inflation increase this study was due July 2002, but has not yet been delivered to Congress; The Medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include additional services, such as laboratory and other diagnostic tests and the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals, in the composite rate this study was due July 2002, but has not yet been delivered to Congress; and Reimbursement for many of the outpatient prescription drugs that we administer to dialysis patients should be changed from the historic rate of 95% of the average wholesale price, or AWP. This study was delivered to Congress but Congress has not acted upon it. If Medicare began to include in its composite reimbursement rate any ancillary services that it currently reimburses separately, our revenue would decrease to the extent there was not a corresponding increase in that composite rate. In particular, Medicare revenue from EPO is approximately 25% of our total Medicare revenue. In January 2003, CMS implemented a new payment structure utilizing a single drug pricer for all drugs that Medicare reimburses, including many we administer. Based on the initial prices CMS has set, we do not expect our reimbursement under this single drug pricer in 2003 to differ materially from what it would have been under the AWP based reimbursement structure. We expect, however, that CMS will change the prices set under this single drug pricer in the future or make other changes to the payment structure for these drugs. If EPO were included in the composite rate, and if the composite rate were not increased sufficiently, our operating earnings and cash flows could decrease substantially. Reductions in current reimbursement rates for EPO or other outpatient prescription drugs would also reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Future declines in Medicaid reimbursement rates would reduce our net income and cash flows. Approximately 5% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues are generated from Medicaid payors. If state governments change Medicaid programs or the rates paid by those programs for our services, then our revenue and earnings may decline. Some of the states Medicaid programs have proposed eligibility changes or have announced that they are considering reductions in the rates for certain services. Any action to reduce the Medicaid coverage rules or reimbursement rates for dialysis and related services would adversely affect our revenue and earnings. 34 If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, our revenue and earnings would decline. If a significant number of physicians stop referring patients to our centers, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical directors of the centers. As a result, the primary referral source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center. If a medical director agreement terminates, whether before or at the end of its term, and a new medical director is appointed, it may negatively impact the former medical directors decision to treat his or her patients at our center. Additionally, the medical directors have no obligation to refer their patients to our centers. Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally five to ten years. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, we renewed the agreements with medical directors at 57 centers. In addition, as of December 31, 2002, there were 30 additional centers at which the medical director agreements required renewal on or before December 31, 2003. We also may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships in order to assure compliance with anti kickback and similar laws. These actions could negatively impact physicians decisions to extend their medical director agreements with us or to refer their patients to us. In addition, if the terms of an existing agreement were found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship, which could lead to the early termination of the agreement, or force the physician to stop referring patients to the centers. If the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel or our high level of personnel turnover continues, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses. We are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. This shortage limits our ability to expand our operations. We also have a high personnel turnover rate in our dialysis centers. Turnover has been the highest among our technicians, nurses and unit secretaries. Recent efforts to reduce this turnover may not succeed. If we are not successful, or if we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, our operations and our same center growth will be negatively impacted. Adverse developments with respect to EPO could materially reduce our net income and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients. Amgen is the sole supplier of EPO and may unilaterally decide to increase its price for EPO at any time. For example, Amgen unilaterally increased its base price for EPO by 3.9% in each of 2002, 2001 and 2000. Also, we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the same discount structure for EPO that we currently receive, or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of discounts within that structure as we have historically achieved. In addition, Amgen has developed a new product, Aranesp&reg;, that may replace EPO or reduce its use with dialysis patients. We cannot predict if or when Aranesp&reg; will be introduced to the U.S. dialysis market, what its cost and reimbursement structure will be, or how it may impact our revenues from EPO. Increases in the cost of EPO and the introduction of Aranesp&reg; could have a material adverse effect on our net income and cash flows. The pending federal review of some of our historical practices and third party carrier review of our laboratory subsidiary could result in substantial penalties against us. We are voluntarily cooperating with the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office and OIG in Philadelphia in a review of some of our practices, including billing and other operating procedures, financial 35 relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies, and the provision of pharmaceutical and other ancillary services. In addition, our Florida laboratory and our now closed Minnesota laboratory are each the subject of a third party carrier review of claims it has submitted for Medicare reimbursement. The DOJ has also requested and received information regarding these laboratories. We are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved, whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters, financial or otherwise. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations, federal and state anti kickback laws, and federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information. The regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers, including dialysis providers, has increased significantly in recent years. In addition, the frequency and intensity of Medicare certification surveys and inspections of dialysis centers has increased markedly since 2000. We endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with the anti kickback laws; however, the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations. In addition, our historic dependence on manual processes that vary widely across our network of dialysis centers exposes us to greater risk of errors in billing and other business processes. Due to regulatory considerations unique to each of these states, all of our dialysis operations in New York and part of our dialysis operations in New Jersey are conducted through privately owned companies to which we provide a broad range of administrative services. These operations account for approximately 7% of our continental U.S. dialysis revenues. We believe that we have structured these operations to comply with the laws and regulations of these states, but we can give no assurances that they will not be challenged. If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations, we could suffer severe consequences, including: Mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses; Suspension of payments from government reimbursement programs; Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable reimbursement program requirements; Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government reimbursement programs; Loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate; Fines or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations, submission of false claims or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements and patient privacy law violations; and Claims for monetary damages from patients who believe their protected health information has been used or disclosed in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws. Our rollout of new information technology systems will significantly disrupt our billing and collection activity, may not work as planned and could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We will be continuing the rollout of new information technology systems and new processes to each of our dialysis centers over the next fifteen months. It is likely that this rollout will disrupt our billing and collection 36 activity and may cause other disruptions to our business operations, which may negatively impact our cash flows. Also, the new information systems may not work as planned or improve our billing and collection processes as expected. If they do not, we may have to spend substantial amounts to enhance or replace these systems. Provisions in our charter documents and compensation programs we have adopted may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests. Our charter documents include provisions which may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent, requiring 60 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our Board of Directors and granting our Board of Directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval, and a poison pill that would substantially dilute the interest sought by an acquirer that our board of directors does not approve. In addition, most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control. We have also adopted a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock options, which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. Based on the shares of our common stock outstanding and the market price of our stock on December 31, 2002, these cash bonuses would total approximately $53 million. These compensation programs may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay. These provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 37 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations, the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on these obligations as of December 31, 2002. For our debt obligations with variable interest rates, the rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of 2002. These rates are based on LIBOR plus a margin of 3.0%. Expected maturity date Total Fairvalue Averageinterestrate 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 125 $ 345 $ 470 $ 478 6.63 % Variable rate $ 8 $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 307 $ 507 $ 849 $ 849 5.10 % Our senior credit facility is based on a floating LIBOR interest rate plus a margin, which is reset periodically and can be locked in for a maximum of six months. As a result, our interest expense is subject to fluctuations as LIBOR interest rates change. One means of assessing exposure to interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (sometimes referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $3.5 million, $1.6 million and $4.7 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company does not currently use any derivative financial instruments to hedge against interest rate exposure. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk.
