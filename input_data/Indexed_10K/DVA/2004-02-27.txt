(2) Total operating expenses include recoveries of $5,192 in 2002 and $35,220 in 2001 of accounts receivable reserved in 1999, net impairment losses of $4,556 in 2000 and impairment and valuation losses of $139,805 in 1999 principally associated with the disposition of the Companys non continental U.S. operations. (3) Refinancing charges (gains) were $26,501 in 2003, representing the consideration paid to redeem the $125,000 5 5/8% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 and the $345,000 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 in excess of book value, the write off of related deferred financing costs and other financing fees associated with amending the bank credit agreement, $48,930 in 2002 representing the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the retirement of the $225,000 outstanding 9 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011, a net gain of $1,629 in 2001 relating to the write off of deferred financing costs and the accelerated swap liquidation gains resulting from debt refinancing. (4) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is computed by dividing earnings by fixed charges. Earnings for this purpose is defined as pretax income from operations adjusted by adding back fixed charges expensed during the period and debt refinancing charges. Fixed charges include debt expense (interest expense and amortization of financing costs), the estimated interest component of rental expense on operating leases, and capitalized interest. (5) Due to our loss in 1999, the ratio coverage in 1999 was less than 1:1. We would have had to generate additional earnings of $182,535 to achieve a coverage of 1:1. 20 Table of Contents (6) The working capital calculation as of December 31, 1999 includes long term debt of $1,425,610 that was potentially callable under covenant provisions.

Debt of $124,700 and $526 was also converted into 4,868,352 and 16,030 shares of common stock in 2003. 21 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, and the risk factors set forth in this Form 10 K. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients and from the administration of pharmaceuticals, possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, the Companys ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, and legal compliance risks such as the ongoing review by the US Attorneys Office and the HHS Office of Inspector General in Philadelphia. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in our forward looking statements. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we have no current intention to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview Our stated mission is to be the provider, employer and partner of choice. We believe our attention to these three areas our patients, our teammates, and our business partners represent the major drivers of our long term success, aside from external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index (DQI). Our clinical outcomes have improved over each of the past three years, and we ended 2003 with the best clinical outcomes that we have ever achieved. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. Over the past three years we have achieved significant reductions in teammate turnover, which has been a major contributor to our performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. We are pleased with the overall clinical, operating and financial performance levels achieved over the past three years, and we expect to be able to generally maintain our current levels of performance over the foreseeable future, absent significant adverse shifts in government policy, physician practice patterns, or mix of commercial plan patients. Although our business has areas of significant potential exposure, as delineated in the risk factors following this discussion and analysis, our operating results over the past three years have not been significantly adversely affected by these risk factors. Our operations represent a single reporting segment, with more than 96% of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis services, of which 88% represents on site dialysis services in approximately 540 centers that are wholly owned or majority owned. Our other direct dialysis services, which operationally are integrated with our center operations, relate to patient performed peritoneal dialysis and acute treatments in hospitals. The principal drivers to our revenue are a) the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week, and b) average treatment revenue. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our pace of opening and acquiring new centers. 22 Table of Contents Our year over year treatment volume growth for 2003 was 6.7%, compared with 5.0% and 6.3% for 2002 and 2001. Approximately 40% of our 2003 growth was associated with new centers, and approximately 60% was attributable to increased treatments. Average revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) treatments, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government reimbursement rates, and our charge capture, billing and collecting operations performance. On average, reimbursement rates from commercial payors are more than double Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment. The percent of patients under government reimbursement programs to total dialysis center patients increased approximately 1% during 2003, and is currently approximately 79%. In terms of revenue dollars, approximately 58% of our total dialysis revenue is from government programs. Government reimbursement rates are principally determined by federal (Medicare) and state (Medicaid) policy, have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reductions. Medicare reimbursements represent approximately 50% of our dialysis revenue, and cumulative increases since 1990 have only totaled 4.6%. There were no Medicare rate increases for 2002 and 2003, and the next increase is scheduled for 2005 at 1.6%. Medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures, and some reductions are anticipated in certain states. Commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Over the past three years we have been successful in maintaining a relatively stable average reimbursement rate in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases. Approximately 40% of our dialysis revenue is associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, and therefore changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, and pharmaceutical intensities significantly influence our revenue levels. Such changes, driven by physician practice patterns and protocols focused on improving clinical outcomes, have accounted for a significant portion of the increase in average revenue per treatment over the past three years. Our operating performance with respect to services charge capture billing and collecting can also be a significant factor in how much average revenue per treatment is actually realized. Over the past two years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes to ensure reliable performance, as well as compliance with federal and state regulations. Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with predicting third party reimbursements in the healthcare industry, our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgement as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. In 2001 we separately reported cash recoveries of $22 million associated with prior years dialysis services as a result of improvements in our billing and collecting operations. Our annual average revenue per treatment increased from $278 in 2001 to $291 in 2002 and to $303 in 2003. These increases were principally due to increases in our standard fee schedules (impacting non contracted commercial revenue), changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial contract negotiations, and continued improvements in revenue capture, billing and collecting operations, while maintaining a relatively stable mix of commercial patients and commercial rates. The principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also 23 Table of Contents represent significant cost changes such as increased insurance costs experienced in 2003. Our average clinical hours per treatment has improved over the past two years primarily because of reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes. There is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in 2003, and federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. Labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends. For the past three years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors, and expect relatively stable pricing through 2004. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenue over the past three years, however this reflects substantial increases in spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes, legal and other professional fees, and expanding support functions. We expect that these higher levels of general and administrative expenses will be generally maintained to support our long term initiatives and to ensure the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Although other revenues represented only approximately 3% of total revenues for 2003 and 2002, changes in the status of disputed Medicare billings at our Florida lab resulted in increased current period revenue and operating income of $21 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The carrier began making payments on Medicare lab billings in the third quarter of 2002 after four years of withholding all payments, and therefore we were able to begin recognizing this revenue which was entirely incremental income because the associated lab revenue costs had always been ongoing. Medicare lab revenues for 2003 current year services amounted to $26 million. In addition to the incremental current period revenue and income, we had Medicare lab recoveries totaling $83 million in 2002 and 2003 associated with lab services provided from 1995 through 2001, representing nearly 90% of the previously disputed Medicare claims. Outlook for 2004 and beyond. We are targeting operating income to be between $360 and $385 million for 2004, compared with $355 for 2003. This is consistent with our current longer term three year outlook of an average annual increase in operating income of three to eight percent for the next three years on a cumulative average basis. However, we believe the potential downside risks for this three year outlook are greater than the upside potentials outside this range. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients and from the administration of pharmaceuticals, possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, our ability to maintain contracts with our physician medical directors, and legal compliance risks such as the ongoing review by the United States Attorneys Office and HHS Office of Inspector General in Philadelphia. We undertake no duty to update these projections, whether due to changes in current or expected trends, underlying market conditions, decisions of the United States Attorneys Office, the DOJ or the OIG in any pending or future review of our business, or otherwise. 24 Table of Contents Results of operations The following is a summary of operating revenues and operating expenses. The divestiture of our dialysis operations outside the continental United States was substantially completed during 2000, and the sale of our remaining non continental centers was completed during the second quarter of 2002. The non continental U.S. operating results are excluded from the revenue and cost trends discussed below. Year ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Net operating revenues: Continental: Current period services $1,992 100 % $1,790 100 % $1,614 100 % Prior years services laboratory 24 59 Prior years services dialysis 22 Non continental 6 15 2,016 1,855 1,651 Operating expenses and charges: Continental: Patient care costs 1,361 68 % 1,212 68 % 1,087 67 % General and administrative 160 8 % 155 9 % 128 8 % Depreciation and amortization 75 4 % 64 4 % 62 4 % Goodwill amortization 42 Provision for uncollectible accounts 36 2 % 32 2 % 32 2 % Recoveries (5 ) (35 ) Minority interest and equity income, net 7 8 7 Non continental 5 17 Total operating expenses and charges 1,638 1,471 1,340 Operating income $ 379 $ 384 $ 311 Operating income excluding non continental operations, prior years recoveries, and goodwill amortization in 2001 (i.e., excluding amounts in italics) $ 355 18 % $ 319 18 % $ 298 18 % Dialysis treatments 6,373,894 5,975,280 5,690,199 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 20,377 19,090 18,185 Average dialysis revenue per treatment (excluding prior years services revenue in 2001) $303 $291 $278 Net operating revenues Net operating revenues. Net operating revenues for current period services for continental U.S. operations increased 11% in both 2003 and 2002. Approximately 4% and 5% of the increases in revenue for 2003 and 2002 were attributable to increases in the average reimbursement rate per treatment and approximately 7% and 5% were due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments. The balance of the increase in 2002 was due to approximately $21 million of additional current year Medicare laboratory revenue. As discussed below, we had not recognized any Medicare laboratory revenue during 2001 due to the ongoing dispute with the third party carrier. Dialysis services revenue. Dialysis services revenue, excluding prior period services revenue, represented approximately 97%, 97% and 98% of current operating revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Lab, other and management fee income account for the balance of revenues. 25 Table of Contents Dialysis services include outpatient center hemodialysis, which accounts for approximately 88% of total dialysis treatments, home dialysis, and inpatient hemodialysis with contracted hospitals. Major components of dialysis revenue include the administration of EPO and other drugs as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents approximately one third of operating revenues. Dialysis services are paid for primarily by Medicare and state Medicaid programs in accordance with rates established by CMS, and by other third party payors such as HMOs and health insurance carriers. Services provided to patients covered by third party insurance companies are on average more than double the Medicare or Medicaid rates. Patients covered by employer group health plans convert to Medicare after a maximum of 33 months. As of year end 2003, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates were between $121 and $144 per treatment, or an overall average of $131 per treatment, excluding the administration of drugs. The majority of our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated reimbursement rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. The commercial reimbursement rates are under continual pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the reimbursement rates generally decline substantially. Dialysis services revenues by payor type were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Percent of total dialysis revenue: Medicare 50 % 51 % 52 % Medicaid and other government based programs 8 8 8 58 59 60 Commercial payors (HMOs, and health insurance carriers) 42 41 40 100 % 100 % 100 % The average dialysis revenue recognized per treatment was $303, $291 and $278 for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2003 was principally due to commercial rate increases and changes in intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The increase in 2002 was principally due to commercial rate increases, changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, continued improvements in revenue capture, billing and collecting operations, and payor contracting. The average dialysis revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $306. Our mix of commercial patients and commercial rates, which is a major profitability factor, remained relatively stable during 2003. The number of dialysis treatments increased 6.7% in 2003 and 5.0% in 2002, principally attributable to non acquired annual growth rates of approximately 4.0% plus growth through acquisitions. We expect the non acquired growth rate to remain in the range of 3.0% to 5.0% through 2004. The prior years services revenue of $22 million in 2001 related to cash recoveries associated with prior years services and resulted from improvements in the Companys billing and collecting operations. Lab and other services. As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements (Contingencies), our Florida based laboratory subsidiary has been under an ongoing third party carrier review for Medicare reimbursement claims since 1998. Prior to the third quarter 2002, no Medicare payments had been received since May 1998. Following a favorable ruling by an administrative law judge in June 2002 relating to review periods from January 1995 to March 1998, the carrier began releasing funds for lab services provided subsequent to May 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the carrier also released funds for certain claims in review periods from 26 Table of Contents April 1998 through May 2001. During the second half of 2002, the carrier paid us a total of $69 million, representing approximately 70% of the total outstanding prior Medicare lab billings for the period from January 1995 through June 2002. Approximately $10 million of these collections related to 2002 lab services provided through June 2002, and the balance of $59 million related to prior years services. In addition to the prior period claims, the carrier also began processing billings for current period services in the third quarter of 2002, at which time we began recognizing current period Medicare lab revenue. The carriers hearing officer recently rendered partially favorable decisions relating to review periods from April 1998 to May 2000, which resulted in our recognition of additional recoveries of $24 million, of which approximately $19 million remains to be paid in the first quarter of 2004. We have filed requests for appeal to an administrative law judge for the remaining unpaid claims of approximately $11 million for review periods from April 1998 through May 2001, but cannot be assured of any further recoveries. Management fee income. Management fee income represented less than 1% of total revenues for 2003 and 2002. Our fees are typically based on a percentage of revenue of the center that we administrate and are established in the management contract. We operated or provided administrative services to 29 and 30 third party or minority owned dialysis centers as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. During the third quarter of 2003 we acquired an outpatient vascular access management business that currently manages the vascular access component at fourteen independent third party physician practices. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and facility costs. As a percentage of net operating revenue, patient care costs were 68% for 2003 and 2002, and 67% for 2001. On a per treatment basis, patient care costs increased approximately $11 and $12 in 2003 and 2002. The increase in both years was principally due to higher labor and insurance costs, and increases in new center openings, as well as increases in the levels of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Increases in revenue per treatment more than offset these cost increases. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and include expenses for corporate and regional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions, and regulatory compliance oversight. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues (excluding prior period services revenue) were approximately 8.0%, 8.7% and 8.0% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In absolute dollars, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $25 million in 2002 and an additional $6 million in 2003. The increase in 2003 principally consisted of higher labor costs. The increase in 2002 was principally due to higher labor and legal costs. The substantial increases in labor costs for 2002 and 2003 principally related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes, as well as expanding support functions. Depreciation and amortization. The increase in depreciation and amortization from $64 million in 2002 to $75 million in 2003 was principally due to new center developments, acquisitions and our new operating and billing systems. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable (excluding prior period services revenue) were approximately 1.8% of current operating revenues in 2003 and 2002, and 2.0% in 2001. During 2002 and 2001, we realized recoveries of $5 million and $35 million associated with aged accounts receivables that had been reserved in 1999. The recoveries and lower provisions in 2003 and 2002 resulted from continued improvements that we have made in our billing and collecting processes. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, and investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses 27 Table of Contents whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when an owned or third party dialysis business experiences deteriorating operating performance or liquidity problems. Goodwill is routinely assessed for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. There were no significant impairments or valuation adjustments during the periods presented. Other income The net of other income items were income of approximately $3 million for 2003, $4 million for 2002, and $3 million for 2001. These amounts included interest income of approximately $3 million for each year. Debt expense and refinancing charges Debt expense for 2003, 2002 and 2001 consisted of interest expense of approximately $64 million, $69 million and $70 million respectively, and amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $3 million for each year. The reduction in interest expense in 2003 was primarily due to lower average interest rates and lower average debt balances. Reclassification of previously reported extraordinary losses. In accordance with SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 14, and Technical Corrections, which became effective as of January 1, 2003, an after tax loss of $29.4 million in 2002 and an after tax gain of $1 million in 2001 resulting from the extinguishment of debt previously classified as extraordinary items have been reclassified to a pre tax refinancing charge of $49 million for 2002 and a pre tax gain of $2 million for 2001. In 2003, the refinancing charges of $27 million related to the consideration paid in excess of book value to redeem our Convertible Subordinated Notes and the write off of deferred financing costs and financing fees associated with amending our bank credit agreement. In 2002, the refinancing charges of $49 million, related to debt restructuring, which included retiring $225 million 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and extinguishing our then existing senior credit facilities. In 2001, the net refinancing gain of $2 million related to the write off of deferred financing costs being more than offset by the accelerated recognition of deferred interest rate swap liquidation gains as a result of debt refinancing. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2003 represented an effective tax rate of 39.0%, compared with 41.0% in 2002 and 43.4% in 2001. The reduction in the effective tax rate in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to a lower provision for state income taxes and utilization of previously unrecognized tax losses. The reduction in 2002 was primarily due to a lower provision for state income tax rates, the elimination of book amortization not deductible for tax purposes and changes in tax valuation estimates. Liquidity and capital resources Cash flow from operations during 2003 amounted to $294 million, compared with $278 million for 2002 not including $64 million in Medicare lab and uncollectible account recoveries related to prior years services. Non operating cash outflows in 2003 included $100 million for capital asset expenditures including $58 million for new center developments, $97 million for acquisitions (net of divestitures), and $107 million in stock repurchases. Non operating cash outflows for 2002 included $103 million for capital asset expenditures, $19 million for acquisitions, and $642 million in stock repurchases. During 2003 we acquired 27 dialysis centers, including controlling ownership interests in two centers in which we previously had minority ownership, for $84 million and opened 30 new dialysis centers. Other 2003 acquisitions related to ancillary operations. During 2002 we acquired 11 dialysis centers for $20 million and opened 19 new dialysis centers. The accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2003 and 2002 represented approximately 69 and 70 days of net revenue, net of bad debt provision. 28 Table of Contents We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations over the next twelve months. Our stated long term general target range for our debt leverage ratio is 3.0 to 3.5, although we expect that it may be outside this range for periods of time. As of year end 2003, our ratio was 2.3. For this purpose, debt leverage ratio is defined as total debt net of cash to annualized operating income excluding depreciation, amortization, and minority interests and equity income, net. 2003 capital structure changes. In the first quarter of 2003, we borrowed $150 million that was available under the Term Loan A of our credit facility. The Term Loan A bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00% for an overall effective rate of 3.19% at December 31, 2003, with provision to potentially further reduce the interest rate to LIBOR plus 1.50% under certain circumstances. The Term Loan A matures in March 2007 and requires annual principal payments of $33.9 million in years 2004 and 2005, $40.1 million in 2006 and $10.6 million in 2007. In July 2003, we completed a call for redemption of all of our outstanding $125 million 5 5/8% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006. Holders of the 5 5/8% Notes had the option to convert their Notes into shares of DaVita common stock at a price of $25.62 per share or receive cash at 1.0169 times the principal amount of the 5 5/8% Notes, plus accrued interest. In July 2003, we issued 4,868,352 shares of common stock from treasury stock for the conversion of nearly all the 5 5/8% Notes, and redeemed the balance for cash and accrued interest. In July 2003, we also entered into an amended credit agreement in order to, among other things, lower the overall interest rate. We also acquired an additional $200 million of borrowings under the replacement Term Loan B, which amounted to $1.042 billion. In November 2003, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement in order to again lower the interest rate on the Term Loan B and to modify certain covenants. The Term Loan B currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% for an overall effective rate of 3.42%, with a provision to potentially further reduce the interest rate to LIBOR plus 2.00% under certain circumstances. The aggregate annual principal payments for the Term Loan B are approximately $11 million in the first four years of the agreement, $255 million in the fifth year and $741 million in the sixth year, due no later than March 2009. In August 2003, we completed a call for redemption of $200 million of our outstanding $345 million 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009. Holders of the 7% Notes had the option to convert their Notes into shares of DaVita common stock at a price of $32.81 per share or receive cash at 1.042 times the principal amount of the 7% Notes, plus accrued interest. All $200 million of the Notes were redeemed for $208 million in cash plus accrued interest. In October 2003, we completed a call for redemption of the remaining $145 million of our 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009. These 7% Notes were redeemed for $155 million in cash, including accrued interest, and 16,030 shares of treasury stock. In November 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the LIBOR benchmark interest rate at 3.39% on an amortizing notional amount of $135 million of our Term Loan B outstanding debt that had the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at 5.64% based upon the margin in effect on December 31, 2003. The agreement expires in November 2008 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2003, the notional amount of the swap was approximately $135 million and its fair value was a $2 million liability, resulting in a charge to other comprehensive income of approximately $1 million, net of tax. As a result of the swap agreement, the effective interest rate on the entire credit facility was 3.69% based upon the margin in effect on December 31, 2003. In January 2004, we entered into another interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the LIBOR benchmark interest rate at 3.08% on an additional amortizing notional amount of $135 million of our Term Loan B outstanding debt that had the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at 5.33% based upon the margin in effect on January 15, 2004. The agreement expires in January 2009 and requires quarterly interest payments. As a 29 Table of Contents result of these two interest rate swap agreements, as of January 15, 2004, approximately 25% of our outstanding variable rate debt is effectively fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 5.49% and our overall credit facility effective weighted average interest rate was 3.89%, based upon current margins. During 2003, we repurchased a total of 3,441,900 shares of our common stock for approximately $107 million, or an average of $31.13 per share, pursuant to Board of Directors authorizations. As of December 31, 2003, we had $146 million remaining to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market pursuant to a $200 million Board of Directors authorization. 2002 capital structure changes. In the first quarter of 2002, we initiated a recapitalization plan to restructure our debt and repurchase common stock. In the initial phase of the recapitalization plan we retired all of our $225 million outstanding 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 for $266 million. Concurrent with the retirement of this debt, we secured a new senior credit facility agreement in the amount of $1.115 billion. The excess of the consideration paid over the book value of the Senior Subordinated Notes and write off of deferred financing costs associated with extinguishing the existing senior credit facilities and the notes resulted in refinancing charges of $49 million. We completed the next phase of the recapitalization plan with the repurchase of 16,682,337 shares of our common stock for approximately $402 million, or $24.10 per share, through a modified dutch auction tender offer. From May through December 2002 we also purchased 7,699,440 shares in the open market for approximately $172 million pursuant to a $225 million Board of Directors authorization. For the year ended December 31, 2002, stock repurchases, including 2,945,700 shares acquired prior to initiating the recapitalization plan, amounted to $642 million for 27,327,477 shares, for a composite average of $23.50 per share. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Nearly all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers, in the form of put options exercisable at the third party owners discretion. These put obligations require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2003 ($ in millions): Within One Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 50 $ 97 $ 766 $ 247 $ 1,160 Capital lease obligations 1 1 3 3 8 Operating leases 62 115 93 153 423 $ 113 $ 213 $ 862 $ 403 $ 1,591 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 15 $ 15 Acquisition of dialysis centers 38 $ 9 $ 13 60 Working capital advances to third parties under administrative services agreements 15 15 $ 68 $ $ 9 $ 13 $ 90 Contingencies Health care provider revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory 30 Table of Contents authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements; and (5) claims for refunds from private payors. As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements (Contingencies), our Florida based laboratory subsidiary has been under an ongoing third party carrier review for Medicare reimbursement claims since 1998. Prior to the third quarter 2002, no Medicare payments had been received since May 1998. Following a favorable ruling by an administrative law judge in June 2002 relating to review periods from January 1995 to March 1998, the carrier began releasing funds for lab services provided subsequent to May 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the carrier also released funds related to review periods from April 1998 through May 2001. During the second half of 2002, the carrier paid us a total of $69 million, of which $59 million related to prior years services. The carriers hearing officer recently rendered partially favorable decisions relating to review periods from April 1998 to May 2000, which resulted in our recognition of additional recoveries of $24 million, of which approximately $19 million remains to be paid in the first quarter of 2004. We have filed requests for appeal to an administrative law judge for the remaining unpaid claims of approximately $11 million for review periods from April 1998 through May 2001, but cannot be assured of any further recoveries. In February 2001 the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of our historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians. We cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the United States Attorneys Office. In May 2002, we received a subpoena from the Philadelphia office of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG. The subpoena requires an update to the information we provided in our response to the February 2001 request, and also seeks a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services, as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The subpoena covers the period from May 1996 to May 2002. We have provided the documents requested. This inquiry remains at an early stage. As it proceeds, the government could expand its areas of concern. If a court determines that there has been wrongdoing, the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these additional pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgements Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgements and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts, impairments and valuation adjustments, and accounting for income taxes, are considered to be critical in evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgements and estimates. 31 Table of Contents Revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in the Companys operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1 Auditing Health Care Third Party Revenues and Related Receivables. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues are recognized as services are provided to patients. Operating revenues consist primarily of reimbursement for dialysis and ancillary services to patients. A usual and customary fee schedule is maintained for our dialysis treatment and other patient services; however, actual collectible revenue is normally at a discount to the fee schedule. Medicare and Medicaid programs are billed at pre determined net realizable rates per treatment that are established by statute or regulation. Most nongovernmental payors, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, but a contractual allowance is recorded to adjust to the expected net realizable revenue for services provided. Contractual allowances along with provisions for uncollectible accounts are estimated based upon credit risks of third party payors, contractual terms, inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes, regulatory compliance issues and historical collection experience. Our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk is generally expected to be within 1% of total revenue, which can represent as much as 5% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses. For example, we recognized $22 million of prior period dialysis revenue in 2001 related to cash recoveries in excess of previous estimates made possible by improvements in our billing and collecting operations. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received after considering possible retroactive adjustments that may be made as a result of the ongoing third party carrier review. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as applicable. An impairment review is performed annually or whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgement about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgements because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable. 32 Table of Contents Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals monthly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, awards and benefit plan contributions, are updated periodically due to changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results may vary due to the subjective nature of fulfilling employee specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by the Companys Board of Directors. Significant new accounting standards for 2003 In January 2003 the FASB issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses the consolidation of certain entities (variable interest entities) in which an enterprise has a controlling financial interest through other than voting interests. FIN No. 46 requires that a variable interest entity be consolidated by the holder of the majority of the expected risks and rewards associated with the activities of the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 150 Accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity was issued in May 2003. This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It also requires certain mandatorily redeemable instruments such as the liability for other owners interests in limited life entities to be measured based upon the fair values of the limited life entities assets, with changes in the liability reported as interest costs. At the October 29, 2003 FASB Board meeting, the Board decided to defer indefinitely the effective date of Statement 150 related to classification and measurement requirements, but not the disclosure requirements, for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments that become subject to Statement 150 solely as a result of consolidation. Our consolidated partnerships include interests in limited life companies for which third party interests are reflected in minority interests in the financial statements. See Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements. 33 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, and capital expenditures. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we do not intend to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from economic and market conditions, the regulatory and reimbursement environment in which we operate, competitive activities and other business conditions. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include those set forth below. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. If the average rates that private payors pay us decline, then our revenues, cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced. Approximately 42% of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have private payors as the primary payor. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at rates materially higher than Medicare rates. Based on our recent experience in negotiating with private payors, we believe that pressure from private payors to decrease the rates they pay us may increase. If the average rates that private payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and earnings. If the number of patients with higher paying commercial insurance declines, then our revenues, cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced. Our revenue levels are sensitive to the percentage of our reimbursements from higher paying commercial plans. A patients insurance coverage may change for a number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the patients or a family members employment status. If there is a significant change in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans relative to plans that pay at lower rates, for example a reduction in the average number of patients under indemnity and PPO plans compared with the average number of patients under HMO plans and government programs, it would negatively impact our revenues, cash flows and earnings. Changes in clinical practices and reimbursement rates or rules for EPO and other drugs could substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. The administration of EPO and other drugs accounts for approximately one third of our net operating revenues. Changes in physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices, changes in private and governmental reimbursement criteria, the introduction of new drugs and the conversion to alternate types of administration, (for example from intravenous administration to subcutaneous or oral administration, that may in turn result in lower or less frequent dosages) could materially reduce our revenues and earnings from the administration of EPO and other drugs. For example, some Medicare fiscal intermediaries are seeking to implement local medical review policies for EPO and vitamin D analogs that would effectively limit utilization of and reimbursement for these drugs. CMS had indicated that it may issue a new national coverage decision that will direct all fiscal intermediaries with respect to reimbursement coverage for EPO. We do not know if or when CMS will issue such decision, or what it will provide. In addition, reductions in current private and government reimbursement rates for EPO or other pharmaceutical drugs would also reduce our net earnings and cash flows. For example, both CMS and members of Congress have proposed changes in the Medicare reimbursement rates for many of the outpatient prescription drugs that we administer to dialysis patients. 34 Table of Contents Adverse developments with respect to EPO could materially reduce our net earnings and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients. Amgen is the sole supplier of EPO and often unilaterally increases its price for EPO. For example, Amgen unilaterally increased its base price for EPO by 3.9% in each of 2002, 2001 and 2000. Although we have contracted coverage for EPO pricing for a fixed time period that includes discount variables depending on certain clinical criteria, we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the same discount structure for EPO that we currently receive, or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of discounts within that structure as we have historically achieved. In addition, Amgen has developed a new product, Aranesp&reg;, that may replace EPO or reduce its use with dialysis patients. We cannot predict if or when Aranesp&reg; will be introduced to the U.S. dialysis market, what its cost and reimbursement structure will be, or how it may impact our revenues from EPO. Increases in the cost of EPO and the introduction of Aranesp&reg; could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and cash flows. Future declines, or the lack of further increases, in Medicare reimbursement rates would reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Approximately 50% of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have Medicare as their primary payor. The Medicare ESRD program reimburses us for dialysis and ancillary services at fixed rates. Unlike most other Medicare programs, the Medicare ESRD program does not provide for periodic inflation increases in reimbursement rates. Increases of 1.2% in 2000 and 2.4% in 2001 were the first increases in the composite rate since 1991, and were significantly less than the cumulative rate of inflation since 1991. For 2002 through 2004 there has been no increase in the composite rate. In 2005 an increase of only 1.6% has been scheduled. Increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, have occurred and are expected to continue to occur with or without a compensating increase in reimbursement rates. We cannot predict with certainty the nature or extent of future rate changes, if any. To the extent these rates are not adjusted to keep pace with inflation, our net earnings and cash flows would be adversely affected. Future changes in the structure of, and reimbursement rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our operating earnings and cash flows. CMS is studying changes to the ESRD program, including whether the Medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include additional services that are now separately billable, such as laboratory and other diagnostic tests and the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals, in the composite rate. If Medicare began to include in its composite reimbursement rate any ancillary services that it currently reimburses separately, our revenue would decrease to the extent there was not a corresponding increase in that composite rate. In particular, Medicare revenue from EPO is approximately 28% of our total Medicare revenue. If EPO were included in the composite rate, and if the rate were not increased sufficiently, our operating earnings and cash flow could decrease substantially. Future declines in Medicaid reimbursement rates would reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Approximately 5% of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have Medicaid as their primary coverage. In addition approximately 3% of our dialysis revenues are from Medicaid secondary coverage. Approximately 45% of our Medicaid revenue is derived from patients in California. If state governments change Medicaid programs or the rates paid by those programs for our services, then our revenue and earnings may decline. Some of the states Medicaid programs have reduced rates for dialysis services, and others have proposed such reductions or other changes to eligibility for Medicaid coverage. Any actions to limit Medicaid coverage or further reduce reimbursement rates for dialysis and related services would adversely affect our revenue and earnings. The pending federal reviews of some of our historical practices could result in substantial penalties against us. We are voluntarily cooperating with the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office and OIG in Philadelphia in a review of some of our practices, including billing and other operating procedures, financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies, and the provision of pharmaceutical and other 35 Table of Contents ancillary services. The DOJ has also requested and received information regarding our laboratories. We are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved, whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters, financial or otherwise. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations, federal and state anti kickback laws, and federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information. The regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers, including dialysis providers, has increased significantly in recent years. In addition, the frequency and intensity of Medicare certification surveys and inspections of dialysis centers have increased markedly since 2000. We endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with the anti kickback laws; however, the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations. In addition, our historical dependence on manual processes that vary widely across our network of dialysis centers exposes us to greater risk of errors in billing and other business processes. Due to regulatory considerations unique to each of these states, all of our dialysis operations in New York and some of our dialysis operations in New Jersey are conducted by privately owned companies to which we provide a broad range of administrative services. These operations account for approximately 7% of our dialysis revenues. We believe that we have structured these operations to comply with the laws and regulations of these states, but we can give no assurances that they will not be challenged. If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations, we could suffer severe consequences, including: Mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses; Suspension of payments from government reimbursement programs; Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable reimbursement program requirements; Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government reimbursement programs; Loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate, including the loss of revenues from operations in New York and New Jersey conducted by privately owned companies as described above; Fines or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations, submission of false claims or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements and patient privacy law violations; and Claims for monetary damages from patients who believe their protected health information has been used or disclosed in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws. If businesses we acquire failed to adhere to regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues and earnings. Businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including for failure to adhere to laws and regulations governing dialysis operations. We generally seek indemnification from the sellers of businesses we acquire, but such liabilities may not be covered or may be greater than contractual limits or the financial resources of the indemnifying party. 36 Table of Contents If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, our revenue and earnings would decline. If a significant number of physicians stop referring patients to our centers, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at dialysis centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical directors of the centers. As a result, the primary referral source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center. If a medical director agreement terminates, whether before or at the end of its term, and a new medical director is appointed, it may negatively impact the former medical directors decision to treat his or her patients at our center. Additionally, both current and former medical directors have no obligation to refer their patients to our centers. Also, if quality or service levels at our centers deteriorate if may negatively impact patient referrals and treatment volumes. Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally five to ten years. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us. As of December 31, 2003, there were 25 centers, accounting for nearly 5% of our treatment volume, at which the medical director agreements required renewal on or before December 31, 2004. We also may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships in order to assure compliance with the safe harbor provisions of the anti kickback statute and other similar laws. These actions could negatively impact physicians decisions to extend their medical director agreements with us or to refer their patients to us. In addition, if the terms of an existing agreement were found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship, which could lead to the early termination of the agreement, or force the physician to stop referring patients to the centers. If the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel continues, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses. We are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. We compete for nurses with hospitals and other health care providers. This nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations. If we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, our operations and treatment growth will be negatively impacted. Provisions in our charter documents and compensation programs we have adopted may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests. Our charter documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent, requiring 60 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our Board of Directors and granting our Board of Directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval, and a poison pill that would substantially dilute the interest sought by an acquirer that our board of directors does not approve. In addition, most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control. We have also adopted a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock options, which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. Based on the shares of our common stock outstanding and the market price of our stock on December 31, 2003, these cash bonuses would total approximately $94 million if a control transaction occurred at that price and our Board of Directors did not modify the program. These compensation programs may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay. These provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations, the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on these obligations as of December 31, 2003. For our debt obligations with variable interest rates, the rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of 2003. These rates are based on LIBOR plus margins based upon performance and leverage criteria. The margins currently in effect are between 2.00% to 2.25%. Expected maturity date Total Fair Value Average interest rate 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 6 $ 1 $ 1 $ 2 $ 3 $ 13 $ 13 5.08 % Variable rate 45 45 52 22 $ 744 247 1,155 1,155 3.69 % Our senior credit facility is based on a floating LIBOR interest rate plus a margin, which is reset periodically and can be locked in for a maximum of six months. As a result, our interest expense is subject to fluctuations as LIBOR interest rates change. In November 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the LIBOR benchmark interest rate at 3.39% on an amortizing notional amount of $135 million of our Term Loan B outstanding debt that had the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at 5.64% based upon the margin in effect on December 31, 2003. The agreement expires in November 2008 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2003, the notional amount of the swap was approximately $135 million and its fair value was a $2 million liability. As a result of the swap agreement our overall effective interest rate on the entire credit facility was 3.69% based upon the margin in effect on December 31, 2003. In January 2004, we entered into another interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the LIBOR benchmark interest rate at 3.08% on an additional amortizing notional amount of $135 million of our Term Loan B outstanding debt that had the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at 5.33% based upon the margin in effect on January 15, 2004. The agreement expires in January 2009 and requires quarterly interest payments. As a result of these two interest rate swap agreements, as of January 15, 2004, approximately 25% of our outstanding variable rate debt is effectively fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 5.49% and our overall credit facility effective weighted average interest rate was 3.89%, based upon the current margins. One means of assessing exposure to interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $6.5 million, $3.5 million and $1.6 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

(2) Total operating expenses include recoveries of $5,192 in 2002 and $35,220 in 2001 of accounts receivable reserved in 1999, net impairment losses of $4,556 in 2000 and impairment and valuation losses of $139,805 in 1999 principally associated with the disposition of the Companys non continental U.S. operations. (3) Refinancing charges (gains) were $26,501 in 2003, representing the consideration paid to redeem the $125,000 5 5/8% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 and the $345,000 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 in excess of book value, the write off of related deferred financing costs and other financing fees associated with amending the bank credit agreement, $48,930 in 2002 representing the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the retirement of the $225,000 outstanding 9 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011, a net gain of $1,629 in 2001 relating to the write off of deferred financing costs and the accelerated swap liquidation gains resulting from debt refinancing. (4) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is computed by dividing earnings by fixed charges. Earnings for this purpose is defined as pretax income from operations adjusted by adding back fixed charges expensed during the period and debt refinancing charges. Fixed charges include debt expense (interest expense and amortization of financing costs), the estimated interest component of rental expense on operating leases, and capitalized interest. (5) Due to our loss in 1999, the ratio coverage in 1999 was less than 1:1. We would have had to generate additional earnings of $182,535 to achieve a coverage of 1:1. 20 Table of Contents (6) The working capital calculation as of December 31, 1999 includes long term debt of $1,425,610 that was potentially callable under covenant provisions.

Forward looking statements This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, and the risk factors set forth in this Form 10 K. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients and from the administration of pharmaceuticals, possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, the Companys ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, and legal compliance risks such as the ongoing review by the US Attorneys Office and the HHS Office of Inspector General in Philadelphia. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in our forward looking statements. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we have no current intention to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview Our stated mission is to be the provider, employer and partner of choice. We believe our attention to these three areas our patients, our teammates, and our business partners represent the major drivers of our long term success, aside from external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index (DQI). Our clinical outcomes have improved over each of the past three years, and we ended 2003 with the best clinical outcomes that we have ever achieved. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. Over the past three years we have achieved significant reductions in teammate turnover, which has been a major contributor to our performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. We are pleased with the overall clinical, operating and financial performance levels achieved over the past three years, and we expect to be able to generally maintain our current levels of performance over the foreseeable future, absent significant adverse shifts in government policy, physician practice patterns, or mix of commercial plan patients. Although our business has areas of significant potential exposure, as delineated in the risk factors following this discussion and analysis, our operating results over the past three years have not been significantly adversely affected by these risk factors. Our operations represent a single reporting segment, with more than 96% of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis services, of which 88% represents on site dialysis services in approximately 540 centers that are wholly owned or majority owned. Our other direct dialysis services, which operationally are integrated with our center operations, relate to patient performed peritoneal dialysis and acute treatments in hospitals. The principal drivers to our revenue are a) the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week, and b) average treatment revenue. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our pace of opening and acquiring new centers. 22 Table of Contents Our year over year treatment volume growth for 2003 was 6.7%, compared with 5.0% and 6.3% for 2002 and 2001. Approximately 40% of our 2003 growth was associated with new centers, and approximately 60% was attributable to increased treatments. Average revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) treatments, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government reimbursement rates, and our charge capture, billing and collecting operations performance. On average, reimbursement rates from commercial payors are more than double Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment. The percent of patients under government reimbursement programs to total dialysis center patients increased approximately 1% during 2003, and is currently approximately 79%. In terms of revenue dollars, approximately 58% of our total dialysis revenue is from government programs. Government reimbursement rates are principally determined by federal (Medicare) and state (Medicaid) policy, have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reductions. Medicare reimbursements represent approximately 50% of our dialysis revenue, and cumulative increases since 1990 have only totaled 4.6%. There were no Medicare rate increases for 2002 and 2003, and the next increase is scheduled for 2005 at 1.6%. Medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures, and some reductions are anticipated in certain states. Commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Over the past three years we have been successful in maintaining a relatively stable average reimbursement rate in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases. Approximately 40% of our dialysis revenue is associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, and therefore changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, and pharmaceutical intensities significantly influence our revenue levels. Such changes, driven by physician practice patterns and protocols focused on improving clinical outcomes, have accounted for a significant portion of the increase in average revenue per treatment over the past three years. Our operating performance with respect to services charge capture billing and collecting can also be a significant factor in how much average revenue per treatment is actually realized. Over the past two years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes to ensure reliable performance, as well as compliance with federal and state regulations. Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with predicting third party reimbursements in the healthcare industry, our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgement as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. In 2001 we separately reported cash recoveries of $22 million associated with prior years dialysis services as a result of improvements in our billing and collecting operations. Our annual average revenue per treatment increased from $278 in 2001 to $291 in 2002 and to $303 in 2003. These increases were principally due to increases in our standard fee schedules (impacting non contracted commercial revenue), changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial contract negotiations, and continued improvements in revenue capture, billing and collecting operations, while maintaining a relatively stable mix of commercial patients and commercial rates. The principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also 23 Table of Contents represent significant cost changes such as increased insurance costs experienced in 2003. Our average clinical hours per treatment has improved over the past two years primarily because of reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes. There is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in 2003, and federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. Labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends. For the past three years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors, and expect relatively stable pricing through 2004. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenue over the past three years, however this reflects substantial increases in spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes, legal and other professional fees, and expanding support functions. We expect that these higher levels of general and administrative expenses will be generally maintained to support our long term initiatives and to ensure the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Although other revenues represented only approximately 3% of total revenues for 2003 and 2002, changes in the status of disputed Medicare billings at our Florida lab resulted in increased current period revenue and operating income of $21 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The carrier began making payments on Medicare lab billings in the third quarter of 2002 after four years of withholding all payments, and therefore we were able to begin recognizing this revenue which was entirely incremental income because the associated lab revenue costs had always been ongoing. Medicare lab revenues for 2003 current year services amounted to $26 million. In addition to the incremental current period revenue and income, we had Medicare lab recoveries totaling $83 million in 2002 and 2003 associated with lab services provided from 1995 through 2001, representing nearly 90% of the previously disputed Medicare claims. Outlook for 2004 and beyond. We are targeting operating income to be between $360 and $385 million for 2004, compared with $355 for 2003. This is consistent with our current longer term three year outlook of an average annual increase in operating income of three to eight percent for the next three years on a cumulative average basis. However, we believe the potential downside risks for this three year outlook are greater than the upside potentials outside this range. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients and from the administration of pharmaceuticals, possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, our ability to maintain contracts with our physician medical directors, and legal compliance risks such as the ongoing review by the United States Attorneys Office and HHS Office of Inspector General in Philadelphia. We undertake no duty to update these projections, whether due to changes in current or expected trends, underlying market conditions, decisions of the United States Attorneys Office, the DOJ or the OIG in any pending or future review of our business, or otherwise. 24 Table of Contents Results of operations The following is a summary of operating revenues and operating expenses. The divestiture of our dialysis operations outside the continental United States was substantially completed during 2000, and the sale of our remaining non continental centers was completed during the second quarter of 2002. The non continental U.S. operating results are excluded from the revenue and cost trends discussed below. Year ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Net operating revenues: Continental: Current period services $1,992 100 % $1,790 100 % $1,614 100 % Prior years services laboratory 24 59 Prior years services dialysis 22 Non continental 6 15 2,016 1,855 1,651 Operating expenses and charges: Continental: Patient care costs 1,361 68 % 1,212 68 % 1,087 67 % General and administrative 160 8 % 155 9 % 128 8 % Depreciation and amortization 75 4 % 64 4 % 62 4 % Goodwill amortization 42 Provision for uncollectible accounts 36 2 % 32 2 % 32 2 % Recoveries (5 ) (35 ) Minority interest and equity income, net 7 8 7 Non continental 5 17 Total operating expenses and charges 1,638 1,471 1,340 Operating income $ 379 $ 384 $ 311 Operating income excluding non continental operations, prior years recoveries, and goodwill amortization in 2001 (i.e., excluding amounts in italics) $ 355 18 % $ 319 18 % $ 298 18 % Dialysis treatments 6,373,894 5,975,280 5,690,199 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 20,377 19,090 18,185 Average dialysis revenue per treatment (excluding prior years services revenue in 2001) $303 $291 $278 Net operating revenues Net operating revenues. Net operating revenues for current period services for continental U.S. operations increased 11% in both 2003 and 2002. Approximately 4% and 5% of the increases in revenue for 2003 and 2002 were attributable to increases in the average reimbursement rate per treatment and approximately 7% and 5% were due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments. The balance of the increase in 2002 was due to approximately $21 million of additional current year Medicare laboratory revenue. As discussed below, we had not recognized any Medicare laboratory revenue during 2001 due to the ongoing dispute with the third party carrier. Dialysis services revenue. Dialysis services revenue, excluding prior period services revenue, represented approximately 97%, 97% and 98% of current operating revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Lab, other and management fee income account for the balance of revenues. 25 Table of Contents Dialysis services include outpatient center hemodialysis, which accounts for approximately 88% of total dialysis treatments, home dialysis, and inpatient hemodialysis with contracted hospitals. Major components of dialysis revenue include the administration of EPO and other drugs as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents approximately one third of operating revenues. Dialysis services are paid for primarily by Medicare and state Medicaid programs in accordance with rates established by CMS, and by other third party payors such as HMOs and health insurance carriers. Services provided to patients covered by third party insurance companies are on average more than double the Medicare or Medicaid rates. Patients covered by employer group health plans convert to Medicare after a maximum of 33 months. As of year end 2003, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates were between $121 and $144 per treatment, or an overall average of $131 per treatment, excluding the administration of drugs. The majority of our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated reimbursement rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. The commercial reimbursement rates are under continual pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the reimbursement rates generally decline substantially. Dialysis services revenues by payor type were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Percent of total dialysis revenue: Medicare 50 % 51 % 52 % Medicaid and other government based programs 8 8 8 58 59 60 Commercial payors (HMOs, and health insurance carriers) 42 41 40 100 % 100 % 100 % The average dialysis revenue recognized per treatment was $303, $291 and $278 for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2003 was principally due to commercial rate increases and changes in intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The increase in 2002 was principally due to commercial rate increases, changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, continued improvements in revenue capture, billing and collecting operations, and payor contracting. The average dialysis revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $306. Our mix of commercial patients and commercial rates, which is a major profitability factor, remained relatively stable during 2003. The number of dialysis treatments increased 6.7% in 2003 and 5.0% in 2002, principally attributable to non acquired annual growth rates of approximately 4.0% plus growth through acquisitions. We expect the non acquired growth rate to remain in the range of 3.0% to 5.0% through 2004. The prior years services revenue of $22 million in 2001 related to cash recoveries associated with prior years services and resulted from improvements in the Companys billing and collecting operations. Lab and other services. As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements (Contingencies), our Florida based laboratory subsidiary has been under an ongoing third party carrier review for Medicare reimbursement claims since 1998. Prior to the third quarter 2002, no Medicare payments had been received since May 1998. Following a favorable ruling by an administrative law judge in June 2002 relating to review periods from January 1995 to March 1998, the carrier began releasing funds for lab services provided subsequent to May 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the carrier also released funds for certain claims in review periods from 26 Table of Contents April 1998 through May 2001. During the second half of 2002, the carrier paid us a total of $69 million, representing approximately 70% of the total outstanding prior Medicare lab billings for the period from January 1995 through June 2002. Approximately $10 million of these collections related to 2002 lab services provided through June 2002, and the balance of $59 million related to prior years services. In addition to the prior period claims, the carrier also began processing billings for current period services in the third quarter of 2002, at which time we began recognizing current period Medicare lab revenue. The carriers hearing officer recently rendered partially favorable decisions relating to review periods from April 1998 to May 2000, which resulted in our recognition of additional recoveries of $24 million, of which approximately $19 million remains to be paid in the first quarter of 2004. We have filed requests for appeal to an administrative law judge for the remaining unpaid claims of approximately $11 million for review periods from April 1998 through May 2001, but cannot be assured of any further recoveries. Management fee income. Management fee income represented less than 1% of total revenues for 2003 and 2002. Our fees are typically based on a percentage of revenue of the center that we administrate and are established in the management contract. We operated or provided administrative services to 29 and 30 third party or minority owned dialysis centers as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. During the third quarter of 2003 we acquired an outpatient vascular access management business that currently manages the vascular access component at fourteen independent third party physician practices. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and facility costs. As a percentage of net operating revenue, patient care costs were 68% for 2003 and 2002, and 67% for 2001. On a per treatment basis, patient care costs increased approximately $11 and $12 in 2003 and 2002. The increase in both years was principally due to higher labor and insurance costs, and increases in new center openings, as well as increases in the levels of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Increases in revenue per treatment more than offset these cost increases. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and include expenses for corporate and regional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions, and regulatory compliance oversight. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues (excluding prior period services revenue) were approximately 8.0%, 8.7% and 8.0% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In absolute dollars, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $25 million in 2002 and an additional $6 million in 2003. The increase in 2003 principally consisted of higher labor costs. The increase in 2002 was principally due to higher labor and legal costs. The substantial increases in labor costs for 2002 and 2003 principally related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes, as well as expanding support functions. Depreciation and amortization. The increase in depreciation and amortization from $64 million in 2002 to $75 million in 2003 was principally due to new center developments, acquisitions and our new operating and billing systems. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable (excluding prior period services revenue) were approximately 1.8% of current operating revenues in 2003 and 2002, and 2.0% in 2001. During 2002 and 2001, we realized recoveries of $5 million and $35 million associated with aged accounts receivables that had been reserved in 1999. The recoveries and lower provisions in 2003 and 2002 resulted from continued improvements that we have made in our billing and collecting processes. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, and investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses 27 Table of Contents whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when an owned or third party dialysis business experiences deteriorating operating performance or liquidity problems. Goodwill is routinely assessed for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. There were no significant impairments or valuation adjustments during the periods presented. Other income The net of other income items were income of approximately $3 million for 2003, $4 million for 2002, and $3 million for 2001. These amounts included interest income of approximately $3 million for each year. Debt expense and refinancing charges Debt expense for 2003, 2002 and 2001 consisted of interest expense of approximately $64 million, $69 million and $70 million respectively, and amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $3 million for each year. The reduction in interest expense in 2003 was primarily due to lower average interest rates and lower average debt balances. Reclassification of previously reported extraordinary losses. In accordance with SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 14, and Technical Corrections, which became effective as of January 1, 2003, an after tax loss of $29.4 million in 2002 and an after tax gain of $1 million in 2001 resulting from the extinguishment of debt previously classified as extraordinary items have been reclassified to a pre tax refinancing charge of $49 million for 2002 and a pre tax gain of $2 million for 2001. In 2003, the refinancing charges of $27 million related to the consideration paid in excess of book value to redeem our Convertible Subordinated Notes and the write off of deferred financing costs and financing fees associated with amending our bank credit agreement. In 2002, the refinancing charges of $49 million, related to debt restructuring, which included retiring $225 million 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and extinguishing our then existing senior credit facilities. In 2001, the net refinancing gain of $2 million related to the write off of deferred financing costs being more than offset by the accelerated recognition of deferred interest rate swap liquidation gains as a result of debt refinancing. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2003 represented an effective tax rate of 39.0%, compared with 41.0% in 2002 and 43.4% in 2001. The reduction in the effective tax rate in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to a lower provision for state income taxes and utilization of previously unrecognized tax losses. The reduction in 2002 was primarily due to a lower provision for state income tax rates, the elimination of book amortization not deductible for tax purposes and changes in tax valuation estimates. Liquidity and capital resources Cash flow from operations during 2003 amounted to $294 million, compared with $278 million for 2002 not including $64 million in Medicare lab and uncollectible account recoveries related to prior years services. Non operating cash outflows in 2003 included $100 million for capital asset expenditures including $58 million for new center developments, $97 million for acquisitions (net of divestitures), and $107 million in stock repurchases. Non operating cash outflows for 2002 included $103 million for capital asset expenditures, $19 million for acquisitions, and $642 million in stock repurchases. During 2003 we acquired 27 dialysis centers, including controlling ownership interests in two centers in which we previously had minority ownership, for $84 million and opened 30 new dialysis centers. Other 2003 acquisitions related to ancillary operations. During 2002 we acquired 11 dialysis centers for $20 million and opened 19 new dialysis centers. The accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2003 and 2002 represented approximately 69 and 70 days of net revenue, net of bad debt provision. 28 Table of Contents We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations over the next twelve months. Our stated long term general target range for our debt leverage ratio is 3.0 to 3.5, although we expect that it may be outside this range for periods of time. As of year end 2003, our ratio was 2.3. For this purpose, debt leverage ratio is defined as total debt net of cash to annualized operating income excluding depreciation, amortization, and minority interests and equity income, net. 2003 capital structure changes. In the first quarter of 2003, we borrowed $150 million that was available under the Term Loan A of our credit facility. The Term Loan A bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00% for an overall effective rate of 3.19% at December 31, 2003, with provision to potentially further reduce the interest rate to LIBOR plus 1.50% under certain circumstances. The Term Loan A matures in March 2007 and requires annual principal payments of $33.9 million in years 2004 and 2005, $40.1 million in 2006 and $10.6 million in 2007. In July 2003, we completed a call for redemption of all of our outstanding $125 million 5 5/8% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006. Holders of the 5 5/8% Notes had the option to convert their Notes into shares of DaVita common stock at a price of $25.62 per share or receive cash at 1.0169 times the principal amount of the 5 5/8% Notes, plus accrued interest. In July 2003, we issued 4,868,352 shares of common stock from treasury stock for the conversion of nearly all the 5 5/8% Notes, and redeemed the balance for cash and accrued interest. In July 2003, we also entered into an amended credit agreement in order to, among other things, lower the overall interest rate. We also acquired an additional $200 million of borrowings under the replacement Term Loan B, which amounted to $1.042 billion. In November 2003, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement in order to again lower the interest rate on the Term Loan B and to modify certain covenants. The Term Loan B currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% for an overall effective rate of 3.42%, with a provision to potentially further reduce the interest rate to LIBOR plus 2.00% under certain circumstances. The aggregate annual principal payments for the Term Loan B are approximately $11 million in the first four years of the agreement, $255 million in the fifth year and $741 million in the sixth year, due no later than March 2009. In August 2003, we completed a call for redemption of $200 million of our outstanding $345 million 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009. Holders of the 7% Notes had the option to convert their Notes into shares of DaVita common stock at a price of $32.81 per share or receive cash at 1.042 times the principal amount of the 7% Notes, plus accrued interest. All $200 million of the Notes were redeemed for $208 million in cash plus accrued interest. In October 2003, we completed a call for redemption of the remaining $145 million of our 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009. These 7% Notes were redeemed for $155 million in cash, including accrued interest, and 16,030 shares of treasury stock. In November 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the LIBOR benchmark interest rate at 3.39% on an amortizing notional amount of $135 million of our Term Loan B outstanding debt that had the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at 5.64% based upon the margin in effect on December 31, 2003. The agreement expires in November 2008 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2003, the notional amount of the swap was approximately $135 million and its fair value was a $2 million liability, resulting in a charge to other comprehensive income of approximately $1 million, net of tax. As a result of the swap agreement, the effective interest rate on the entire credit facility was 3.69% based upon the margin in effect on December 31, 2003. In January 2004, we entered into another interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the LIBOR benchmark interest rate at 3.08% on an additional amortizing notional amount of $135 million of our Term Loan B outstanding debt that had the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at 5.33% based upon the margin in effect on January 15, 2004. The agreement expires in January 2009 and requires quarterly interest payments. As a 29 Table of Contents result of these two interest rate swap agreements, as of January 15, 2004, approximately 25% of our outstanding variable rate debt is effectively fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 5.49% and our overall credit facility effective weighted average interest rate was 3.89%, based upon current margins. During 2003, we repurchased a total of 3,441,900 shares of our common stock for approximately $107 million, or an average of $31.13 per share, pursuant to Board of Directors authorizations. As of December 31, 2003, we had $146 million remaining to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market pursuant to a $200 million Board of Directors authorization. 2002 capital structure changes. In the first quarter of 2002, we initiated a recapitalization plan to restructure our debt and repurchase common stock. In the initial phase of the recapitalization plan we retired all of our $225 million outstanding 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 for $266 million. Concurrent with the retirement of this debt, we secured a new senior credit facility agreement in the amount of $1.115 billion. The excess of the consideration paid over the book value of the Senior Subordinated Notes and write off of deferred financing costs associated with extinguishing the existing senior credit facilities and the notes resulted in refinancing charges of $49 million. We completed the next phase of the recapitalization plan with the repurchase of 16,682,337 shares of our common stock for approximately $402 million, or $24.10 per share, through a modified dutch auction tender offer. From May through December 2002 we also purchased 7,699,440 shares in the open market for approximately $172 million pursuant to a $225 million Board of Directors authorization. For the year ended December 31, 2002, stock repurchases, including 2,945,700 shares acquired prior to initiating the recapitalization plan, amounted to $642 million for 27,327,477 shares, for a composite average of $23.50 per share. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Nearly all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers, in the form of put options exercisable at the third party owners discretion. These put obligations require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2003 ($ in millions): Within One Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 50 $ 97 $ 766 $ 247 $ 1,160 Capital lease obligations 1 1 3 3 8 Operating leases 62 115 93 153 423 $ 113 $ 213 $ 862 $ 403 $ 1,591 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 15 $ 15 Acquisition of dialysis centers 38 $ 9 $ 13 60 Working capital advances to third parties under administrative services agreements 15 15 $ 68 $ $ 9 $ 13 $ 90 Contingencies Health care provider revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory 30 Table of Contents authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements; and (5) claims for refunds from private payors. As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements (Contingencies), our Florida based laboratory subsidiary has been under an ongoing third party carrier review for Medicare reimbursement claims since 1998. Prior to the third quarter 2002, no Medicare payments had been received since May 1998. Following a favorable ruling by an administrative law judge in June 2002 relating to review periods from January 1995 to March 1998, the carrier began releasing funds for lab services provided subsequent to May 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the carrier also released funds related to review periods from April 1998 through May 2001. During the second half of 2002, the carrier paid us a total of $69 million, of which $59 million related to prior years services. The carriers hearing officer recently rendered partially favorable decisions relating to review periods from April 1998 to May 2000, which resulted in our recognition of additional recoveries of $24 million, of which approximately $19 million remains to be paid in the first quarter of 2004. We have filed requests for appeal to an administrative law judge for the remaining unpaid claims of approximately $11 million for review periods from April 1998 through May 2001, but cannot be assured of any further recoveries. In February 2001 the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of our historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians. We cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the United States Attorneys Office. In May 2002, we received a subpoena from the Philadelphia office of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG. The subpoena requires an update to the information we provided in our response to the February 2001 request, and also seeks a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services, as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The subpoena covers the period from May 1996 to May 2002. We have provided the documents requested. This inquiry remains at an early stage. As it proceeds, the government could expand its areas of concern. If a court determines that there has been wrongdoing, the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these additional pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgements Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgements and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts, impairments and valuation adjustments, and accounting for income taxes, are considered to be critical in evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgements and estimates. 31 Table of Contents Revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in the Companys operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1 Auditing Health Care Third Party Revenues and Related Receivables. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues are recognized as services are provided to patients. Operating revenues consist primarily of reimbursement for dialysis and ancillary services to patients. A usual and customary fee schedule is maintained for our dialysis treatment and other patient services; however, actual collectible revenue is normally at a discount to the fee schedule. Medicare and Medicaid programs are billed at pre determined net realizable rates per treatment that are established by statute or regulation. Most nongovernmental payors, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, but a contractual allowance is recorded to adjust to the expected net realizable revenue for services provided. Contractual allowances along with provisions for uncollectible accounts are estimated based upon credit risks of third party payors, contractual terms, inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes, regulatory compliance issues and historical collection experience. Our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk is generally expected to be within 1% of total revenue, which can represent as much as 5% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses. For example, we recognized $22 million of prior period dialysis revenue in 2001 related to cash recoveries in excess of previous estimates made possible by improvements in our billing and collecting operations. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received after considering possible retroactive adjustments that may be made as a result of the ongoing third party carrier review. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as applicable. An impairment review is performed annually or whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgement about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgements because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable. 32 Table of Contents Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals monthly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, awards and benefit plan contributions, are updated periodically due to changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results may vary due to the subjective nature of fulfilling employee specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by the Companys Board of Directors. Significant new accounting standards for 2003 In January 2003 the FASB issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses the consolidation of certain entities (variable interest entities) in which an enterprise has a controlling financial interest through other than voting interests. FIN No. 46 requires that a variable interest entity be consolidated by the holder of the majority of the expected risks and rewards associated with the activities of the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 150 Accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity was issued in May 2003. This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It also requires certain mandatorily redeemable instruments such as the liability for other owners interests in limited life entities to be measured based upon the fair values of the limited life entities assets, with changes in the liability reported as interest costs. At the October 29, 2003 FASB Board meeting, the Board decided to defer indefinitely the effective date of Statement 150 related to classification and measurement requirements, but not the disclosure requirements, for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments that become subject to Statement 150 solely as a result of consolidation. Our consolidated partnerships include interests in limited life companies for which third party interests are reflected in minority interests in the financial statements. See Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements. 33 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, and capital expenditures. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we do not intend to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from economic and market conditions, the regulatory and reimbursement environment in which we operate, competitive activities and other business conditions. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include those set forth below. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. If the average rates that private payors pay us decline, then our revenues, cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced. Approximately 42% of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have private payors as the primary payor. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at rates materially higher than Medicare rates. Based on our recent experience in negotiating with private payors, we believe that pressure from private payors to decrease the rates they pay us may increase. If the average rates that private payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and earnings. If the number of patients with higher paying commercial insurance declines, then our revenues, cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced. Our revenue levels are sensitive to the percentage of our reimbursements from higher paying commercial plans. A patients insurance coverage may change for a number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the patients or a family members employment status. If there is a significant change in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans relative to plans that pay at lower rates, for example a reduction in the average number of patients under indemnity and PPO plans compared with the average number of patients under HMO plans and government programs, it would negatively impact our revenues, cash flows and earnings. Changes in clinical practices and reimbursement rates or rules for EPO and other drugs could substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. The administration of EPO and other drugs accounts for approximately one third of our net operating revenues. Changes in physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices, changes in private and governmental reimbursement criteria, the introduction of new drugs and the conversion to alternate types of administration, (for example from intravenous administration to subcutaneous or oral administration, that may in turn result in lower or less frequent dosages) could materially reduce our revenues and earnings from the administration of EPO and other drugs. For example, some Medicare fiscal intermediaries are seeking to implement local medical review policies for EPO and vitamin D analogs that would effectively limit utilization of and reimbursement for these drugs. CMS had indicated that it may issue a new national coverage decision that will direct all fiscal intermediaries with respect to reimbursement coverage for EPO. We do not know if or when CMS will issue such decision, or what it will provide. In addition, reductions in current private and government reimbursement rates for EPO or other pharmaceutical drugs would also reduce our net earnings and cash flows. For example, both CMS and members of Congress have proposed changes in the Medicare reimbursement rates for many of the outpatient prescription drugs that we administer to dialysis patients. 34 Table of Contents Adverse developments with respect to EPO could materially reduce our net earnings and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients. Amgen is the sole supplier of EPO and often unilaterally increases its price for EPO. For example, Amgen unilaterally increased its base price for EPO by 3.9% in each of 2002, 2001 and 2000. Although we have contracted coverage for EPO pricing for a fixed time period that includes discount variables depending on certain clinical criteria, we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the same discount structure for EPO that we currently receive, or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of discounts within that structure as we have historically achieved. In addition, Amgen has developed a new product, Aranesp&reg;, that may replace EPO or reduce its use with dialysis patients. We cannot predict if or when Aranesp&reg; will be introduced to the U.S. dialysis market, what its cost and reimbursement structure will be, or how it may impact our revenues from EPO. Increases in the cost of EPO and the introduction of Aranesp&reg; could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and cash flows. Future declines, or the lack of further increases, in Medicare reimbursement rates would reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Approximately 50% of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have Medicare as their primary payor. The Medicare ESRD program reimburses us for dialysis and ancillary services at fixed rates. Unlike most other Medicare programs, the Medicare ESRD program does not provide for periodic inflation increases in reimbursement rates. Increases of 1.2% in 2000 and 2.4% in 2001 were the first increases in the composite rate since 1991, and were significantly less than the cumulative rate of inflation since 1991. For 2002 through 2004 there has been no increase in the composite rate. In 2005 an increase of only 1.6% has been scheduled. Increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, have occurred and are expected to continue to occur with or without a compensating increase in reimbursement rates. We cannot predict with certainty the nature or extent of future rate changes, if any. To the extent these rates are not adjusted to keep pace with inflation, our net earnings and cash flows would be adversely affected. Future changes in the structure of, and reimbursement rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our operating earnings and cash flows. CMS is studying changes to the ESRD program, including whether the Medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include additional services that are now separately billable, such as laboratory and other diagnostic tests and the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals, in the composite rate. If Medicare began to include in its composite reimbursement rate any ancillary services that it currently reimburses separately, our revenue would decrease to the extent there was not a corresponding increase in that composite rate. In particular, Medicare revenue from EPO is approximately 28% of our total Medicare revenue. If EPO were included in the composite rate, and if the rate were not increased sufficiently, our operating earnings and cash flow could decrease substantially. Future declines in Medicaid reimbursement rates would reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Approximately 5% of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have Medicaid as their primary coverage. In addition approximately 3% of our dialysis revenues are from Medicaid secondary coverage. Approximately 45% of our Medicaid revenue is derived from patients in California. If state governments change Medicaid programs or the rates paid by those programs for our services, then our revenue and earnings may decline. Some of the states Medicaid programs have reduced rates for dialysis services, and others have proposed such reductions or other changes to eligibility for Medicaid coverage. Any actions to limit Medicaid coverage or further reduce reimbursement rates for dialysis and related services would adversely affect our revenue and earnings. The pending federal reviews of some of our historical practices could result in substantial penalties against us. We are voluntarily cooperating with the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office and OIG in Philadelphia in a review of some of our practices, including billing and other operating procedures, financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies, and the provision of pharmaceutical and other 35 Table of Contents ancillary services. The DOJ has also requested and received information regarding our laboratories. We are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved, whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters, financial or otherwise. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations, federal and state anti kickback laws, and federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information. The regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers, including dialysis providers, has increased significantly in recent years. In addition, the frequency and intensity of Medicare certification surveys and inspections of dialysis centers have increased markedly since 2000. We endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with the anti kickback laws; however, the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations. In addition, our historical dependence on manual processes that vary widely across our network of dialysis centers exposes us to greater risk of errors in billing and other business processes. Due to regulatory considerations unique to each of these states, all of our dialysis operations in New York and some of our dialysis operations in New Jersey are conducted by privately owned companies to which we provide a broad range of administrative services. These operations account for approximately 7% of our dialysis revenues. We believe that we have structured these operations to comply with the laws and regulations of these states, but we can give no assurances that they will not be challenged. If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations, we could suffer severe consequences, including: Mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses; Suspension of payments from government reimbursement programs; Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable reimbursement program requirements; Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government reimbursement programs; Loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate, including the loss of revenues from operations in New York and New Jersey conducted by privately owned companies as described above; Fines or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations, submission of false claims or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements and patient privacy law violations; and Claims for monetary damages from patients who believe their protected health information has been used or disclosed in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws. If businesses we acquire failed to adhere to regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues and earnings. Businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including for failure to adhere to laws and regulations governing dialysis operations. We generally seek indemnification from the sellers of businesses we acquire, but such liabilities may not be covered or may be greater than contractual limits or the financial resources of the indemnifying party. 36 Table of Contents If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, our revenue and earnings would decline. If a significant number of physicians stop referring patients to our centers, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at dialysis centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical directors of the centers. As a result, the primary referral source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center. If a medical director agreement terminates, whether before or at the end of its term, and a new medical director is appointed, it may negatively impact the former medical directors decision to treat his or her patients at our center. Additionally, both current and former medical directors have no obligation to refer their patients to our centers. Also, if quality or service levels at our centers deteriorate if may negatively impact patient referrals and treatment volumes. Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally five to ten years. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us. As of December 31, 2003, there were 25 centers, accounting for nearly 5% of our treatment volume, at which the medical director agreements required renewal on or before December 31, 2004. We also may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships in order to assure compliance with the safe harbor provisions of the anti kickback statute and other similar laws. These actions could negatively impact physicians decisions to extend their medical director agreements with us or to refer their patients to us. In addition, if the terms of an existing agreement were found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship, which could lead to the early termination of the agreement, or force the physician to stop referring patients to the centers. If the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel continues, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses. We are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. We compete for nurses with hospitals and other health care providers. This nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations. If we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, our operations and treatment growth will be negatively impacted. Provisions in our charter documents and compensation programs we have adopted may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests. Our charter documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent, requiring 60 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our Board of Directors and granting our Board of Directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval, and a poison pill that would substantially dilute the interest sought by an acquirer that our board of directors does not approve. In addition, most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control. We have also adopted a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock options, which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. Based on the shares of our common stock outstanding and the market price of our stock on December 31, 2003, these cash bonuses would total approximately $94 million if a control transaction occurred at that price and our Board of Directors did not modify the program. These compensation programs may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay. These provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations, the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on these obligations as of December 31, 2003. For our debt obligations with variable interest rates, the rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of 2003. These rates are based on LIBOR plus margins based upon performance and leverage criteria. The margins currently in effect are between 2.00% to 2.25%. Expected maturity date Total Fair Value Average interest rate 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 6 $ 1 $ 1 $ 2 $ 3 $ 13 $ 13 5.08 % Variable rate 45 45 52 22 $ 744 247 1,155 1,155 3.69 % Our senior credit facility is based on a floating LIBOR interest rate plus a margin, which is reset periodically and can be locked in for a maximum of six months. As a result, our interest expense is subject to fluctuations as LIBOR interest rates change. In November 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the LIBOR benchmark interest rate at 3.39% on an amortizing notional amount of $135 million of our Term Loan B outstanding debt that had the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at 5.64% based upon the margin in effect on December 31, 2003. The agreement expires in November 2008 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2003, the notional amount of the swap was approximately $135 million and its fair value was a $2 million liability. As a result of the swap agreement our overall effective interest rate on the entire credit facility was 3.69% based upon the margin in effect on December 31, 2003. In January 2004, we entered into another interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the LIBOR benchmark interest rate at 3.08% on an additional amortizing notional amount of $135 million of our Term Loan B outstanding debt that had the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at 5.33% based upon the margin in effect on January 15, 2004. The agreement expires in January 2009 and requires quarterly interest payments. As a result of these two interest rate swap agreements, as of January 15, 2004, approximately 25% of our outstanding variable rate debt is effectively fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 5.49% and our overall credit facility effective weighted average interest rate was 3.89%, based upon the current margins. One means of assessing exposure to interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $6.5 million, $3.5 million and $1.6 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, and the risk factors set forth in this Form 10 K. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients and from the administration of pharmaceuticals, possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, the Companys ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, and legal compliance risks such as the ongoing review by the US Attorneys Office and the HHS Office of Inspector General in Philadelphia. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in our forward looking statements. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we have no current intention to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview Our stated mission is to be the provider, employer and partner of choice. We believe our attention to these three areas our patients, our teammates, and our business partners represent the major drivers of our long term success, aside from external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index (DQI). Our clinical outcomes have improved over each of the past three years, and we ended 2003 with the best clinical outcomes that we have ever achieved. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. Over the past three years we have achieved significant reductions in teammate turnover, which has been a major contributor to our performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. We are pleased with the overall clinical, operating and financial performance levels achieved over the past three years, and we expect to be able to generally maintain our current levels of performance over the foreseeable future, absent significant adverse shifts in government policy, physician practice patterns, or mix of commercial plan patients. Although our business has areas of significant potential exposure, as delineated in the risk factors following this discussion and analysis, our operating results over the past three years have not been significantly adversely affected by these risk factors. Our operations represent a single reporting segment, with more than 96% of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis services, of which 88% represents on site dialysis services in approximately 540 centers that are wholly owned or majority owned. Our other direct dialysis services, which operationally are integrated with our center operations, relate to patient performed peritoneal dialysis and acute treatments in hospitals. The principal drivers to our revenue are a) the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week, and b) average treatment revenue. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our pace of opening and acquiring new centers. 22 Table of Contents Our year over year treatment volume growth for 2003 was 6.7%, compared with 5.0% and 6.3% for 2002 and 2001. Approximately 40% of our 2003 growth was associated with new centers, and approximately 60% was attributable to increased treatments. Average revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) treatments, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government reimbursement rates, and our charge capture, billing and collecting operations performance. On average, reimbursement rates from commercial payors are more than double Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment. The percent of patients under government reimbursement programs to total dialysis center patients increased approximately 1% during 2003, and is currently approximately 79%. In terms of revenue dollars, approximately 58% of our total dialysis revenue is from government programs. Government reimbursement rates are principally determined by federal (Medicare) and state (Medicaid) policy, have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reductions. Medicare reimbursements represent approximately 50% of our dialysis revenue, and cumulative increases since 1990 have only totaled 4.6%. There were no Medicare rate increases for 2002 and 2003, and the next increase is scheduled for 2005 at 1.6%. Medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures, and some reductions are anticipated in certain states. Commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Over the past three years we have been successful in maintaining a relatively stable average reimbursement rate in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases. Approximately 40% of our dialysis revenue is associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, and therefore changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, and pharmaceutical intensities significantly influence our revenue levels. Such changes, driven by physician practice patterns and protocols focused on improving clinical outcomes, have accounted for a significant portion of the increase in average revenue per treatment over the past three years. Our operating performance with respect to services charge capture billing and collecting can also be a significant factor in how much average revenue per treatment is actually realized. Over the past two years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes to ensure reliable performance, as well as compliance with federal and state regulations. Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with predicting third party reimbursements in the healthcare industry, our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgement as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. In 2001 we separately reported cash recoveries of $22 million associated with prior years dialysis services as a result of improvements in our billing and collecting operations. Our annual average revenue per treatment increased from $278 in 2001 to $291 in 2002 and to $303 in 2003. These increases were principally due to increases in our standard fee schedules (impacting non contracted commercial revenue), changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial contract negotiations, and continued improvements in revenue capture, billing and collecting operations, while maintaining a relatively stable mix of commercial patients and commercial rates. The principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also 23 Table of Contents represent significant cost changes such as increased insurance costs experienced in 2003. Our average clinical hours per treatment has improved over the past two years primarily because of reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes. There is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in 2003, and federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. Labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends. For the past three years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors, and expect relatively stable pricing through 2004. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenue over the past three years, however this reflects substantial increases in spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes, legal and other professional fees, and expanding support functions. We expect that these higher levels of general and administrative expenses will be generally maintained to support our long term initiatives and to ensure the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Although other revenues represented only approximately 3% of total revenues for 2003 and 2002, changes in the status of disputed Medicare billings at our Florida lab resulted in increased current period revenue and operating income of $21 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The carrier began making payments on Medicare lab billings in the third quarter of 2002 after four years of withholding all payments, and therefore we were able to begin recognizing this revenue which was entirely incremental income because the associated lab revenue costs had always been ongoing. Medicare lab revenues for 2003 current year services amounted to $26 million. In addition to the incremental current period revenue and income, we had Medicare lab recoveries totaling $83 million in 2002 and 2003 associated with lab services provided from 1995 through 2001, representing nearly 90% of the previously disputed Medicare claims. Outlook for 2004 and beyond. We are targeting operating income to be between $360 and $385 million for 2004, compared with $355 for 2003. This is consistent with our current longer term three year outlook of an average annual increase in operating income of three to eight percent for the next three years on a cumulative average basis. However, we believe the potential downside risks for this three year outlook are greater than the upside potentials outside this range. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients and from the administration of pharmaceuticals, possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, our ability to maintain contracts with our physician medical directors, and legal compliance risks such as the ongoing review by the United States Attorneys Office and HHS Office of Inspector General in Philadelphia. We undertake no duty to update these projections, whether due to changes in current or expected trends, underlying market conditions, decisions of the United States Attorneys Office, the DOJ or the OIG in any pending or future review of our business, or otherwise. 24 Table of Contents Results of operations The following is a summary of operating revenues and operating expenses. The divestiture of our dialysis operations outside the continental United States was substantially completed during 2000, and the sale of our remaining non continental centers was completed during the second quarter of 2002. The non continental U.S. operating results are excluded from the revenue and cost trends discussed below. Year ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Net operating revenues: Continental: Current period services $1,992 100 % $1,790 100 % $1,614 100 % Prior years services laboratory 24 59 Prior years services dialysis 22 Non continental 6 15 2,016 1,855 1,651 Operating expenses and charges: Continental: Patient care costs 1,361 68 % 1,212 68 % 1,087 67 % General and administrative 160 8 % 155 9 % 128 8 % Depreciation and amortization 75 4 % 64 4 % 62 4 % Goodwill amortization 42 Provision for uncollectible accounts 36 2 % 32 2 % 32 2 % Recoveries (5 ) (35 ) Minority interest and equity income, net 7 8 7 Non continental 5 17 Total operating expenses and charges 1,638 1,471 1,340 Operating income $ 379 $ 384 $ 311 Operating income excluding non continental operations, prior years recoveries, and goodwill amortization in 2001 (i.e., excluding amounts in italics) $ 355 18 % $ 319 18 % $ 298 18 % Dialysis treatments 6,373,894 5,975,280 5,690,199 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 20,377 19,090 18,185 Average dialysis revenue per treatment (excluding prior years services revenue in 2001) $303 $291 $278 Net operating revenues Net operating revenues. Net operating revenues for current period services for continental U.S. operations increased 11% in both 2003 and 2002. Approximately 4% and 5% of the increases in revenue for 2003 and 2002 were attributable to increases in the average reimbursement rate per treatment and approximately 7% and 5% were due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments. The balance of the increase in 2002 was due to approximately $21 million of additional current year Medicare laboratory revenue. As discussed below, we had not recognized any Medicare laboratory revenue during 2001 due to the ongoing dispute with the third party carrier. Dialysis services revenue. Dialysis services revenue, excluding prior period services revenue, represented approximately 97%, 97% and 98% of current operating revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Lab, other and management fee income account for the balance of revenues. 25 Table of Contents Dialysis services include outpatient center hemodialysis, which accounts for approximately 88% of total dialysis treatments, home dialysis, and inpatient hemodialysis with contracted hospitals. Major components of dialysis revenue include the administration of EPO and other drugs as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents approximately one third of operating revenues. Dialysis services are paid for primarily by Medicare and state Medicaid programs in accordance with rates established by CMS, and by other third party payors such as HMOs and health insurance carriers. Services provided to patients covered by third party insurance companies are on average more than double the Medicare or Medicaid rates. Patients covered by employer group health plans convert to Medicare after a maximum of 33 months. As of year end 2003, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates were between $121 and $144 per treatment, or an overall average of $131 per treatment, excluding the administration of drugs. The majority of our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated reimbursement rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. The commercial reimbursement rates are under continual pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the reimbursement rates generally decline substantially. Dialysis services revenues by payor type were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Percent of total dialysis revenue: Medicare 50 % 51 % 52 % Medicaid and other government based programs 8 8 8 58 59 60 Commercial payors (HMOs, and health insurance carriers) 42 41 40 100 % 100 % 100 % The average dialysis revenue recognized per treatment was $303, $291 and $278 for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2003 was principally due to commercial rate increases and changes in intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The increase in 2002 was principally due to commercial rate increases, changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, continued improvements in revenue capture, billing and collecting operations, and payor contracting. The average dialysis revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $306. Our mix of commercial patients and commercial rates, which is a major profitability factor, remained relatively stable during 2003. The number of dialysis treatments increased 6.7% in 2003 and 5.0% in 2002, principally attributable to non acquired annual growth rates of approximately 4.0% plus growth through acquisitions. We expect the non acquired growth rate to remain in the range of 3.0% to 5.0% through 2004. The prior years services revenue of $22 million in 2001 related to cash recoveries associated with prior years services and resulted from improvements in the Companys billing and collecting operations. Lab and other services. As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements (Contingencies), our Florida based laboratory subsidiary has been under an ongoing third party carrier review for Medicare reimbursement claims since 1998. Prior to the third quarter 2002, no Medicare payments had been received since May 1998. Following a favorable ruling by an administrative law judge in June 2002 relating to review periods from January 1995 to March 1998, the carrier began releasing funds for lab services provided subsequent to May 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the carrier also released funds for certain claims in review periods from 26 Table of Contents April 1998 through May 2001. During the second half of 2002, the carrier paid us a total of $69 million, representing approximately 70% of the total outstanding prior Medicare lab billings for the period from January 1995 through June 2002. Approximately $10 million of these collections related to 2002 lab services provided through June 2002, and the balance of $59 million related to prior years services. In addition to the prior period claims, the carrier also began processing billings for current period services in the third quarter of 2002, at which time we began recognizing current period Medicare lab revenue. The carriers hearing officer recently rendered partially favorable decisions relating to review periods from April 1998 to May 2000, which resulted in our recognition of additional recoveries of $24 million, of which approximately $19 million remains to be paid in the first quarter of 2004. We have filed requests for appeal to an administrative law judge for the remaining unpaid claims of approximately $11 million for review periods from April 1998 through May 2001, but cannot be assured of any further recoveries. Management fee income. Management fee income represented less than 1% of total revenues for 2003 and 2002. Our fees are typically based on a percentage of revenue of the center that we administrate and are established in the management contract. We operated or provided administrative services to 29 and 30 third party or minority owned dialysis centers as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. During the third quarter of 2003 we acquired an outpatient vascular access management business that currently manages the vascular access component at fourteen independent third party physician practices. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and facility costs. As a percentage of net operating revenue, patient care costs were 68% for 2003 and 2002, and 67% for 2001. On a per treatment basis, patient care costs increased approximately $11 and $12 in 2003 and 2002. The increase in both years was principally due to higher labor and insurance costs, and increases in new center openings, as well as increases in the levels of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Increases in revenue per treatment more than offset these cost increases. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and include expenses for corporate and regional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions, and regulatory compliance oversight. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues (excluding prior period services revenue) were approximately 8.0%, 8.7% and 8.0% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In absolute dollars, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $25 million in 2002 and an additional $6 million in 2003. The increase in 2003 principally consisted of higher labor costs. The increase in 2002 was principally due to higher labor and legal costs. The substantial increases in labor costs for 2002 and 2003 principally related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes, as well as expanding support functions. Depreciation and amortization. The increase in depreciation and amortization from $64 million in 2002 to $75 million in 2003 was principally due to new center developments, acquisitions and our new operating and billing systems. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable (excluding prior period services revenue) were approximately 1.8% of current operating revenues in 2003 and 2002, and 2.0% in 2001. During 2002 and 2001, we realized recoveries of $5 million and $35 million associated with aged accounts receivables that had been reserved in 1999. The recoveries and lower provisions in 2003 and 2002 resulted from continued improvements that we have made in our billing and collecting processes. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, and investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses 27 Table of Contents whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when an owned or third party dialysis business experiences deteriorating operating performance or liquidity problems. Goodwill is routinely assessed for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. There were no significant impairments or valuation adjustments during the periods presented. Other income The net of other income items were income of approximately $3 million for 2003, $4 million for 2002, and $3 million for 2001. These amounts included interest income of approximately $3 million for each year. Debt expense and refinancing charges Debt expense for 2003, 2002 and 2001 consisted of interest expense of approximately $64 million, $69 million and $70 million respectively, and amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $3 million for each year. The reduction in interest expense in 2003 was primarily due to lower average interest rates and lower average debt balances. Reclassification of previously reported extraordinary losses. In accordance with SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 14, and Technical Corrections, which became effective as of January 1, 2003, an after tax loss of $29.4 million in 2002 and an after tax gain of $1 million in 2001 resulting from the extinguishment of debt previously classified as extraordinary items have been reclassified to a pre tax refinancing charge of $49 million for 2002 and a pre tax gain of $2 million for 2001. In 2003, the refinancing charges of $27 million related to the consideration paid in excess of book value to redeem our Convertible Subordinated Notes and the write off of deferred financing costs and financing fees associated with amending our bank credit agreement. In 2002, the refinancing charges of $49 million, related to debt restructuring, which included retiring $225 million 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and extinguishing our then existing senior credit facilities. In 2001, the net refinancing gain of $2 million related to the write off of deferred financing costs being more than offset by the accelerated recognition of deferred interest rate swap liquidation gains as a result of debt refinancing. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2003 represented an effective tax rate of 39.0%, compared with 41.0% in 2002 and 43.4% in 2001. The reduction in the effective tax rate in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to a lower provision for state income taxes and utilization of previously unrecognized tax losses. The reduction in 2002 was primarily due to a lower provision for state income tax rates, the elimination of book amortization not deductible for tax purposes and changes in tax valuation estimates. Liquidity and capital resources Cash flow from operations during 2003 amounted to $294 million, compared with $278 million for 2002 not including $64 million in Medicare lab and uncollectible account recoveries related to prior years services. Non operating cash outflows in 2003 included $100 million for capital asset expenditures including $58 million for new center developments, $97 million for acquisitions (net of divestitures), and $107 million in stock repurchases. Non operating cash outflows for 2002 included $103 million for capital asset expenditures, $19 million for acquisitions, and $642 million in stock repurchases. During 2003 we acquired 27 dialysis centers, including controlling ownership interests in two centers in which we previously had minority ownership, for $84 million and opened 30 new dialysis centers. Other 2003 acquisitions related to ancillary operations. During 2002 we acquired 11 dialysis centers for $20 million and opened 19 new dialysis centers. The accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2003 and 2002 represented approximately 69 and 70 days of net revenue, net of bad debt provision. 28 Table of Contents We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations over the next twelve months. Our stated long term general target range for our debt leverage ratio is 3.0 to 3.5, although we expect that it may be outside this range for periods of time. As of year end 2003, our ratio was 2.3. For this purpose, debt leverage ratio is defined as total debt net of cash to annualized operating income excluding depreciation, amortization, and minority interests and equity income, net. 2003 capital structure changes. In the first quarter of 2003, we borrowed $150 million that was available under the Term Loan A of our credit facility. The Term Loan A bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00% for an overall effective rate of 3.19% at December 31, 2003, with provision to potentially further reduce the interest rate to LIBOR plus 1.50% under certain circumstances. The Term Loan A matures in March 2007 and requires annual principal payments of $33.9 million in years 2004 and 2005, $40.1 million in 2006 and $10.6 million in 2007. In July 2003, we completed a call for redemption of all of our outstanding $125 million 5 5/8% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006. Holders of the 5 5/8% Notes had the option to convert their Notes into shares of DaVita common stock at a price of $25.62 per share or receive cash at 1.0169 times the principal amount of the 5 5/8% Notes, plus accrued interest. In July 2003, we issued 4,868,352 shares of common stock from treasury stock for the conversion of nearly all the 5 5/8% Notes, and redeemed the balance for cash and accrued interest. In July 2003, we also entered into an amended credit agreement in order to, among other things, lower the overall interest rate. We also acquired an additional $200 million of borrowings under the replacement Term Loan B, which amounted to $1.042 billion. In November 2003, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement in order to again lower the interest rate on the Term Loan B and to modify certain covenants. The Term Loan B currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% for an overall effective rate of 3.42%, with a provision to potentially further reduce the interest rate to LIBOR plus 2.00% under certain circumstances. The aggregate annual principal payments for the Term Loan B are approximately $11 million in the first four years of the agreement, $255 million in the fifth year and $741 million in the sixth year, due no later than March 2009. In August 2003, we completed a call for redemption of $200 million of our outstanding $345 million 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009. Holders of the 7% Notes had the option to convert their Notes into shares of DaVita common stock at a price of $32.81 per share or receive cash at 1.042 times the principal amount of the 7% Notes, plus accrued interest. All $200 million of the Notes were redeemed for $208 million in cash plus accrued interest. In October 2003, we completed a call for redemption of the remaining $145 million of our 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009. These 7% Notes were redeemed for $155 million in cash, including accrued interest, and 16,030 shares of treasury stock. In November 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the LIBOR benchmark interest rate at 3.39% on an amortizing notional amount of $135 million of our Term Loan B outstanding debt that had the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at 5.64% based upon the margin in effect on December 31, 2003. The agreement expires in November 2008 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2003, the notional amount of the swap was approximately $135 million and its fair value was a $2 million liability, resulting in a charge to other comprehensive income of approximately $1 million, net of tax. As a result of the swap agreement, the effective interest rate on the entire credit facility was 3.69% based upon the margin in effect on December 31, 2003. In January 2004, we entered into another interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the LIBOR benchmark interest rate at 3.08% on an additional amortizing notional amount of $135 million of our Term Loan B outstanding debt that had the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at 5.33% based upon the margin in effect on January 15, 2004. The agreement expires in January 2009 and requires quarterly interest payments. As a 29 Table of Contents result of these two interest rate swap agreements, as of January 15, 2004, approximately 25% of our outstanding variable rate debt is effectively fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 5.49% and our overall credit facility effective weighted average interest rate was 3.89%, based upon current margins. During 2003, we repurchased a total of 3,441,900 shares of our common stock for approximately $107 million, or an average of $31.13 per share, pursuant to Board of Directors authorizations. As of December 31, 2003, we had $146 million remaining to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market pursuant to a $200 million Board of Directors authorization. 2002 capital structure changes. In the first quarter of 2002, we initiated a recapitalization plan to restructure our debt and repurchase common stock. In the initial phase of the recapitalization plan we retired all of our $225 million outstanding 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 for $266 million. Concurrent with the retirement of this debt, we secured a new senior credit facility agreement in the amount of $1.115 billion. The excess of the consideration paid over the book value of the Senior Subordinated Notes and write off of deferred financing costs associated with extinguishing the existing senior credit facilities and the notes resulted in refinancing charges of $49 million. We completed the next phase of the recapitalization plan with the repurchase of 16,682,337 shares of our common stock for approximately $402 million, or $24.10 per share, through a modified dutch auction tender offer. From May through December 2002 we also purchased 7,699,440 shares in the open market for approximately $172 million pursuant to a $225 million Board of Directors authorization. For the year ended December 31, 2002, stock repurchases, including 2,945,700 shares acquired prior to initiating the recapitalization plan, amounted to $642 million for 27,327,477 shares, for a composite average of $23.50 per share. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Nearly all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers, in the form of put options exercisable at the third party owners discretion. These put obligations require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2003 ($ in millions): Within One Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 50 $ 97 $ 766 $ 247 $ 1,160 Capital lease obligations 1 1 3 3 8 Operating leases 62 115 93 153 423 $ 113 $ 213 $ 862 $ 403 $ 1,591 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 15 $ 15 Acquisition of dialysis centers 38 $ 9 $ 13 60 Working capital advances to third parties under administrative services agreements 15 15 $ 68 $ $ 9 $ 13 $ 90 Contingencies Health care provider revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory 30 Table of Contents authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements; and (5) claims for refunds from private payors. As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements (Contingencies), our Florida based laboratory subsidiary has been under an ongoing third party carrier review for Medicare reimbursement claims since 1998. Prior to the third quarter 2002, no Medicare payments had been received since May 1998. Following a favorable ruling by an administrative law judge in June 2002 relating to review periods from January 1995 to March 1998, the carrier began releasing funds for lab services provided subsequent to May 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the carrier also released funds related to review periods from April 1998 through May 2001. During the second half of 2002, the carrier paid us a total of $69 million, of which $59 million related to prior years services. The carriers hearing officer recently rendered partially favorable decisions relating to review periods from April 1998 to May 2000, which resulted in our recognition of additional recoveries of $24 million, of which approximately $19 million remains to be paid in the first quarter of 2004. We have filed requests for appeal to an administrative law judge for the remaining unpaid claims of approximately $11 million for review periods from April 1998 through May 2001, but cannot be assured of any further recoveries. In February 2001 the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of our historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians. We cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the United States Attorneys Office. In May 2002, we received a subpoena from the Philadelphia office of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG. The subpoena requires an update to the information we provided in our response to the February 2001 request, and also seeks a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services, as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The subpoena covers the period from May 1996 to May 2002. We have provided the documents requested. This inquiry remains at an early stage. As it proceeds, the government could expand its areas of concern. If a court determines that there has been wrongdoing, the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these additional pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgements Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgements and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts, impairments and valuation adjustments, and accounting for income taxes, are considered to be critical in evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgements and estimates. 31 Table of Contents Revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in the Companys operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1 Auditing Health Care Third Party Revenues and Related Receivables. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues are recognized as services are provided to patients. Operating revenues consist primarily of reimbursement for dialysis and ancillary services to patients. A usual and customary fee schedule is maintained for our dialysis treatment and other patient services; however, actual collectible revenue is normally at a discount to the fee schedule. Medicare and Medicaid programs are billed at pre determined net realizable rates per treatment that are established by statute or regulation. Most nongovernmental payors, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, but a contractual allowance is recorded to adjust to the expected net realizable revenue for services provided. Contractual allowances along with provisions for uncollectible accounts are estimated based upon credit risks of third party payors, contractual terms, inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes, regulatory compliance issues and historical collection experience. Our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk is generally expected to be within 1% of total revenue, which can represent as much as 5% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses. For example, we recognized $22 million of prior period dialysis revenue in 2001 related to cash recoveries in excess of previous estimates made possible by improvements in our billing and collecting operations. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received after considering possible retroactive adjustments that may be made as a result of the ongoing third party carrier review. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as applicable. An impairment review is performed annually or whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgement about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgements because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable. 32 Table of Contents Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals monthly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, awards and benefit plan contributions, are updated periodically due to changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results may vary due to the subjective nature of fulfilling employee specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by the Companys Board of Directors. Significant new accounting standards for 2003 In January 2003 the FASB issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses the consolidation of certain entities (variable interest entities) in which an enterprise has a controlling financial interest through other than voting interests. FIN No. 46 requires that a variable interest entity be consolidated by the holder of the majority of the expected risks and rewards associated with the activities of the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 150 Accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity was issued in May 2003. This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It also requires certain mandatorily redeemable instruments such as the liability for other owners interests in limited life entities to be measured based upon the fair values of the limited life entities assets, with changes in the liability reported as interest costs. At the October 29, 2003 FASB Board meeting, the Board decided to defer indefinitely the effective date of Statement 150 related to classification and measurement requirements, but not the disclosure requirements, for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments that become subject to Statement 150 solely as a result of consolidation. Our consolidated partnerships include interests in limited life companies for which third party interests are reflected in minority interests in the financial statements. See Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements. 33 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS This Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, and capital expenditures. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we do not intend to update these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks resulting from economic and market conditions, the regulatory and reimbursement environment in which we operate, competitive activities and other business conditions. Our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include those set forth below. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. If the average rates that private payors pay us decline, then our revenues, cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced. Approximately 42% of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have private payors as the primary payor. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at rates materially higher than Medicare rates. Based on our recent experience in negotiating with private payors, we believe that pressure from private payors to decrease the rates they pay us may increase. If the average rates that private payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and earnings. If the number of patients with higher paying commercial insurance declines, then our revenues, cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced. Our revenue levels are sensitive to the percentage of our reimbursements from higher paying commercial plans. A patients insurance coverage may change for a number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the patients or a family members employment status. If there is a significant change in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans relative to plans that pay at lower rates, for example a reduction in the average number of patients under indemnity and PPO plans compared with the average number of patients under HMO plans and government programs, it would negatively impact our revenues, cash flows and earnings. Changes in clinical practices and reimbursement rates or rules for EPO and other drugs could substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. The administration of EPO and other drugs accounts for approximately one third of our net operating revenues. Changes in physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices, changes in private and governmental reimbursement criteria, the introduction of new drugs and the conversion to alternate types of administration, (for example from intravenous administration to subcutaneous or oral administration, that may in turn result in lower or less frequent dosages) could materially reduce our revenues and earnings from the administration of EPO and other drugs. For example, some Medicare fiscal intermediaries are seeking to implement local medical review policies for EPO and vitamin D analogs that would effectively limit utilization of and reimbursement for these drugs. CMS had indicated that it may issue a new national coverage decision that will direct all fiscal intermediaries with respect to reimbursement coverage for EPO. We do not know if or when CMS will issue such decision, or what it will provide. In addition, reductions in current private and government reimbursement rates for EPO or other pharmaceutical drugs would also reduce our net earnings and cash flows. For example, both CMS and members of Congress have proposed changes in the Medicare reimbursement rates for many of the outpatient prescription drugs that we administer to dialysis patients. 34 Table of Contents Adverse developments with respect to EPO could materially reduce our net earnings and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients. Amgen is the sole supplier of EPO and often unilaterally increases its price for EPO. For example, Amgen unilaterally increased its base price for EPO by 3.9% in each of 2002, 2001 and 2000. Although we have contracted coverage for EPO pricing for a fixed time period that includes discount variables depending on certain clinical criteria, we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the same discount structure for EPO that we currently receive, or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of discounts within that structure as we have historically achieved. In addition, Amgen has developed a new product, Aranesp&reg;, that may replace EPO or reduce its use with dialysis patients. We cannot predict if or when Aranesp&reg; will be introduced to the U.S. dialysis market, what its cost and reimbursement structure will be, or how it may impact our revenues from EPO. Increases in the cost of EPO and the introduction of Aranesp&reg; could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and cash flows. Future declines, or the lack of further increases, in Medicare reimbursement rates would reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Approximately 50% of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have Medicare as their primary payor. The Medicare ESRD program reimburses us for dialysis and ancillary services at fixed rates. Unlike most other Medicare programs, the Medicare ESRD program does not provide for periodic inflation increases in reimbursement rates. Increases of 1.2% in 2000 and 2.4% in 2001 were the first increases in the composite rate since 1991, and were significantly less than the cumulative rate of inflation since 1991. For 2002 through 2004 there has been no increase in the composite rate. In 2005 an increase of only 1.6% has been scheduled. Increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, have occurred and are expected to continue to occur with or without a compensating increase in reimbursement rates. We cannot predict with certainty the nature or extent of future rate changes, if any. To the extent these rates are not adjusted to keep pace with inflation, our net earnings and cash flows would be adversely affected. Future changes in the structure of, and reimbursement rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our operating earnings and cash flows. CMS is studying changes to the ESRD program, including whether the Medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include additional services that are now separately billable, such as laboratory and other diagnostic tests and the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals, in the composite rate. If Medicare began to include in its composite reimbursement rate any ancillary services that it currently reimburses separately, our revenue would decrease to the extent there was not a corresponding increase in that composite rate. In particular, Medicare revenue from EPO is approximately 28% of our total Medicare revenue. If EPO were included in the composite rate, and if the rate were not increased sufficiently, our operating earnings and cash flow could decrease substantially. Future declines in Medicaid reimbursement rates would reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Approximately 5% of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have Medicaid as their primary coverage. In addition approximately 3% of our dialysis revenues are from Medicaid secondary coverage. Approximately 45% of our Medicaid revenue is derived from patients in California. If state governments change Medicaid programs or the rates paid by those programs for our services, then our revenue and earnings may decline. Some of the states Medicaid programs have reduced rates for dialysis services, and others have proposed such reductions or other changes to eligibility for Medicaid coverage. Any actions to limit Medicaid coverage or further reduce reimbursement rates for dialysis and related services would adversely affect our revenue and earnings. The pending federal reviews of some of our historical practices could result in substantial penalties against us. We are voluntarily cooperating with the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office and OIG in Philadelphia in a review of some of our practices, including billing and other operating procedures, financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies, and the provision of pharmaceutical and other 35 Table of Contents ancillary services. The DOJ has also requested and received information regarding our laboratories. We are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved, whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters, financial or otherwise. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenue and earnings. Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations, federal and state anti kickback laws, and federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information. The regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers, including dialysis providers, has increased significantly in recent years. In addition, the frequency and intensity of Medicare certification surveys and inspections of dialysis centers have increased markedly since 2000. We endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with the anti kickback laws; however, the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations. In addition, our historical dependence on manual processes that vary widely across our network of dialysis centers exposes us to greater risk of errors in billing and other business processes. Due to regulatory considerations unique to each of these states, all of our dialysis operations in New York and some of our dialysis operations in New Jersey are conducted by privately owned companies to which we provide a broad range of administrative services. These operations account for approximately 7% of our dialysis revenues. We believe that we have structured these operations to comply with the laws and regulations of these states, but we can give no assurances that they will not be challenged. If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations, we could suffer severe consequences, including: Mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses; Suspension of payments from government reimbursement programs; Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable reimbursement program requirements; Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government reimbursement programs; Loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate, including the loss of revenues from operations in New York and New Jersey conducted by privately owned companies as described above; Fines or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations, submission of false claims or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements and patient privacy law violations; and Claims for monetary damages from patients who believe their protected health information has been used or disclosed in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws. If businesses we acquire failed to adhere to regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues and earnings. Businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including for failure to adhere to laws and regulations governing dialysis operations. We generally seek indemnification from the sellers of businesses we acquire, but such liabilities may not be covered or may be greater than contractual limits or the financial resources of the indemnifying party. 36 Table of Contents If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, our revenue and earnings would decline. If a significant number of physicians stop referring patients to our centers, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at dialysis centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical directors of the centers. As a result, the primary referral source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center. If a medical director agreement terminates, whether before or at the end of its term, and a new medical director is appointed, it may negatively impact the former medical directors decision to treat his or her patients at our center. Additionally, both current and former medical directors have no obligation to refer their patients to our centers. Also, if quality or service levels at our centers deteriorate if may negatively impact patient referrals and treatment volumes. Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally five to ten years. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us. As of December 31, 2003, there were 25 centers, accounting for nearly 5% of our treatment volume, at which the medical director agreements required renewal on or before December 31, 2004. We also may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships in order to assure compliance with the safe harbor provisions of the anti kickback statute and other similar laws. These actions could negatively impact physicians decisions to extend their medical director agreements with us or to refer their patients to us. In addition, if the terms of an existing agreement were found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship, which could lead to the early termination of the agreement, or force the physician to stop referring patients to the centers. If the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel continues, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses. We are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. We compete for nurses with hospitals and other health care providers. This nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations. If we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, our operations and treatment growth will be negatively impacted. Provisions in our charter documents and compensation programs we have adopted may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests. Our charter documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent, requiring 60 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our Board of Directors and granting our Board of Directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval, and a poison pill that would substantially dilute the interest sought by an acquirer that our board of directors does not approve. In addition, most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control. We have also adopted a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock options, which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. Based on the shares of our common stock outstanding and the market price of our stock on December 31, 2003, these cash bonuses would total approximately $94 million if a control transaction occurred at that price and our Board of Directors did not modify the program. These compensation programs may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay. These provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations, the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on these obligations as of December 31, 2003. For our debt obligations with variable interest rates, the rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of 2003. These rates are based on LIBOR plus margins based upon performance and leverage criteria. The margins currently in effect are between 2.00% to 2.25%. Expected maturity date Total Fair Value Average interest rate 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 6 $ 1 $ 1 $ 2 $ 3 $ 13 $ 13 5.08 % Variable rate 45 45 52 22 $ 744 247 1,155 1,155 3.69 % Our senior credit facility is based on a floating LIBOR interest rate plus a margin, which is reset periodically and can be locked in for a maximum of six months. As a result, our interest expense is subject to fluctuations as LIBOR interest rates change. In November 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the LIBOR benchmark interest rate at 3.39% on an amortizing notional amount of $135 million of our Term Loan B outstanding debt that had the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at 5.64% based upon the margin in effect on December 31, 2003. The agreement expires in November 2008 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2003, the notional amount of the swap was approximately $135 million and its fair value was a $2 million liability. As a result of the swap agreement our overall effective interest rate on the entire credit facility was 3.69% based upon the margin in effect on December 31, 2003. In January 2004, we entered into another interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the LIBOR benchmark interest rate at 3.08% on an additional amortizing notional amount of $135 million of our Term Loan B outstanding debt that had the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at 5.33% based upon the margin in effect on January 15, 2004. The agreement expires in January 2009 and requires quarterly interest payments. As a result of these two interest rate swap agreements, as of January 15, 2004, approximately 25% of our outstanding variable rate debt is effectively fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 5.49% and our overall credit facility effective weighted average interest rate was 3.89%, based upon the current margins. One means of assessing exposure to interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $6.5 million, $3.5 million and $1.6 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk.
