Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Annual report on Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements that do not concern historical facts are forward looking statements and include among other things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, and capital expenditures. These statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements, including, but not limited to, risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, and the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients, possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, and legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the ongoing review by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and the OIG and the subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and our ability to complete acquisitions of businesses, including the consummation of the Gambro Healthcare acquisition, terms of the related financing, and subsequent integration of the business. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, other than in connection with our quarterly reporting on Form 10 Q or in our Annual Report on Form 10 K, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview Our stated mission is to be the provider, employer and partner of choice. We believe our attention to these three areas our patients, our teammates, and our business partners represent the major drivers of our long term success, aside from external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes have improved over each of the past three years, and we ended 2004 with the best clinical outcomes that we have ever achieved. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. Over the past three years we have achieved significant reductions in teammate turnover, which has been a major contributor to our performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. We are pleased with the overall clinical, operating and financial performance levels achieved over the past three years. Although our business has areas of significant potential exposure, as delineated in the risk factors following this discussion and analysis, our operating results over the past three years have not been significantly adversely affected by these risk factors. Our operations represent a single reporting segment, with approximately 96% of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis services, of which 88% represents on site dialysis services in 624 centers that are wholly owned or majority owned. Our other direct dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our center operations, relate to patient performed peritoneal dialysis and acute treatments in hospitals. 22 Table of Contents The principal drivers of our revenue are a) the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week, and b) average treatment revenue. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our pace of opening and acquiring new centers. Our year over year treatment volume growth for 2004 was 10.8%, compared with 6.7% and 5.0% for 2003 and 2002. Approximately 40% of our growth in each of the last two years was associated with new centers, and approximately 60% was attributable to increased treatments. Average revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) treatments, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government reimbursement rates, and our dialysis services charge capture, billing and collecting operations performance. On average, reimbursement rates from commercial payors are more than double Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment. The percent of patients under government reimbursement programs to total dialysis center patients increased approximately 1% over the past two years, and is currently approximately 79%. In terms of revenue dollars, approximately 60% of our total dialysis revenue is from government or government based programs. Government reimbursement rates are principally determined by federal (Medicare) and state (Medicaid) policy, have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reductions. Medicare reimbursements represent approximately 50% of our dialysis revenue, and cumulative increases since 1990 total approximately 5%. There were no Medicare reimbursement rate increases for 2003 and 2004. A 1.6% increase became effective on January 1, 2005, however this increase will be more than offset by other structural changes to Medicare dialysis reimbursement rates that also became effective January 1, 2005. Medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures. Approximately 40% of our dialysis revenue is from commercial healthcare plans and contracted managed care payors. Commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Over the past three years we have been successful in maintaining a relatively stable average reimbursement rate in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases. Approximately 40% of our dialysis revenue has been associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, and therefore changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, and pharmaceutical intensities significantly influence our revenue levels. Such changes, driven by physician practice patterns and protocols focused on improving clinical outcomes, have accounted for a significant portion of the increase in average revenue per treatment over the past three years. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services charge capture, billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average revenue per treatment is actually realized. Over the past three years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that have helped improve our operating performance and reduce our regulatory compliance risks. Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with predicting third party reimbursements in the healthcare industry, our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. 23 Table of Contents Our annual average revenue per treatment increased from $291 in 2002 to $303 in 2003 and to $312 in 2004. These increases were principally due to increases in our standard fee schedules (impacting non contracted commercial revenue), changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial contract negotiations, and continued improvements in revenue capture, billing and collection operations, while maintaining a relatively stable mix of commercial patients and commercial rates. The principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost changes such as increased insurance costs experienced in 2003. Our average clinical hours per treatment has improved over the past three years primarily because of reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in 2004, and federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. Labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends. For the past three years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors, and expect relatively stable pricing through 2005. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenue over the past three years. However, this reflects substantial increases in spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes, legal and other professional fees, and expanding support functions. We expect that these higher levels of general and administrative expenses will be generally maintained to support our long term initiatives and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Although other revenues represent less than 5% of total revenues, successful resolutions of disputed Medicare billings at our Florida lab resulted in recoveries related to prior years services being recognized as current period revenue and operating income of $8 million, $24 million, and $59 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The carrier began making payments on Medicare lab billings in the third quarter of 2002 after four years of withholding all payments. Therefore we were able to begin recognizing Medicare lab revenue as services were provided, incrementally increasing income by such revenue. Medicare lab revenues for 2004 current year services amounted to $34 million. Gambro Healthcare Acquisition. On December 6, 2004, we entered into an agreement to acquire Gambro Healthcare, Inc., or Gambro Healthcare, a subsidiary of Gambro AB, one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, for a purchase price of approximately $3.05 billion in cash. We currently plan to finance this transaction and refinance our existing credit facility through the issuance of notes and the entry into a new senior secured credit facility. In conjunction with the acquisition, we are entering into a 10 year product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products Inc., a subsidiary of Gambro AB, to provide a significant majority of our dialysis equipment and supplies. We expect that the acquisition will increase our revenues by more than 80% based on 2004 levels. The timing of the completion of the acquisition transaction is dependent on the governments Hart Scott Rodino antitrust review process. On February 18, 2005, the Company received a request from the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, for additional information in connection with the acquisition. The request extends the waiting period imposed by the Hart Scott Rodino Act until thirty days after the Company and Gambro Healthcare have substantially complied with the request, unless that period is voluntarily extended by the parties or is terminated sooner by the FTC. In connection with obtaining antitrust clearance, we may decide to, or the FTC or other regulatory agencies with jurisdiction may require us to, divest certain of our or Gambro Healthcares dialysis centers. Outlook for 2005. We are currently targeting operating income to be between 2% and 6% higher than the 2004 level, exclusive of the effects of the Gambro Healthcare acquisition and related debt financing, and exclusive of the expensing of stock options required by FASB No. 123R. In connection with the Gambro acquisition the Company will be assessing financing alternatives, which could include closing some or all of the financing in advance of the closing of the acquisition. At this time, we expect the Gambro Healthcare acquisition together with the related debt financing to be dilutive to earnings per share, or EPS, in the first year after the 24 Table of Contents closing of the acquisition, neutral in the second year, and accretive thereafter. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients, possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, our ability to maintain contracts with our physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the ongoing review by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the OIG and the subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York, and our ability to complete acquisitions of businesses, including the consummation of the Gambro acquisition, terms of the related financing, and subsequent integration of the businesses. You should read Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. Results of operations Following is a summary of operating results for reference in the discussion that follows: Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, except per treatment data) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 2,291 100 % $ 1,992 100 % $ 1,796 100 % Prior years services laboratory 8 24 59 2,299 2,016 1,855 Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 1,555 68 % 1,361 68 % 1,218 68 % General and administrative 192 8 % 160 8 % 154 9 % Depreciation and amortization 87 4 % 75 4 % 64 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 41 2 % 36 2 % 32 2 % Recoveries (5 ) Minority interests and equity income, net 14 7 8 Total operating expenses and charges 1,889 1,638 1,471 Operating income including prior years recoveries, (i.e., including amounts in italics) $ 410 $ 379 $ 384 Dialysis treatments 7,062,424 6,373,894 5,975,280 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 22,528 20,377 19,090 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 312 $ 303 $ 291 Net operating revenues Dialysis revenues represented approximately 96% of net operating revenues in 2004, and 97% in 2003 and 2002. Lab and other ancillary services and management fee income accounted for the balance of revenues. Operating revenues for current period services increased 15% in 2004 and 11% in 2003. Approximately 11% and 7% of the increases in revenue for 2004 and 2003 were due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments and approximately 3% and 4% was attributable to increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment. The balance of the increase in 2004 was due to additional lab, management fees and ancillary revenue. Dialysis revenues. Dialysis services include outpatient center hemodialysis, home dialysis and inpatient hemodialysis under contracts with hospitals, which accounted for approximately 88%, 7% and 5% of total 25 Table of Contents dialysis revenues, respectively. Major components of dialysis revenues include the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents approximately 40% of total dialysis revenues. Approximately 60% of our total dialysis revenues are from government based programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, with the balance from more than 600 commercial payors under more than 1500 commercial healthcare plans and approximately 300 managed care contracts. Approximately 50% of our total dialysis revenues are associated with Medicare patients, who represent nearly 70% of our total patients. Services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans are paid on average at more than double the Medicare or Medicaid rates. Patients covered by employer group health plans convert to Medicare after a maximum of 33 months. As of year end 2004, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $121 and $144 per treatment, or an overall average of $131 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. The majority of our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated reimbursement rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. The commercial reimbursement rates are under continuous downward pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the reimbursement rates normally decline substantially. No single payor accounts for more than 5% of total dialysis revenues. The number of dialysis treatments increased 10.8% in 2004 and 6.7% in 2003. Acquisitions accounted for 5.8% and 2.8% of treatment growth for 2004 and 2003. Non acquired treatment growth was 5.0% and 3.9% for 2004 and 2003. The average dialysis revenues recognized per treatment was $312, $303 and $291 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in average dialysis revenues per treatment in 2004 and 2003 was principally due to commercial rate increases and changes in intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The average dialysis revenues per treatment for the fourth quarter of 2004 was approximately $311. Our mix of commercial patients and commercial rates, which is a major profitability factor, remained relatively stable during 2004. Lab and other services. A third party carrier review of Medicare reimbursement claims associated with our Florida based laboratory was initiated in 1998. Prior to the third quarter 2002, no Medicare payments had been received since May 1998. Following a favorable ruling by an administrative law judge in June 2002 relating to review periods from January 1995 to March 1998, the carrier began releasing funds for lab services provided subsequent to May 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the carrier also released funds for certain claims in review periods from April 1998 through May 2001. During the second half of 2002, the carrier paid us a total of $69 million. Approximately $10 million of these collections related to 2002 lab services provided through June 2002, and the balance of $59 million related to prior years services. In addition to paying the prior period claims, the carrier also began processing billings for current period services in the third quarter of 2002, at which time we began recognizing current period Medicare lab revenue. In late 2003 the carriers hearing officer rendered partially favorable decisions relating to review periods from April 1998 to May 2000, resulting in our recognition of additional recoveries of $24 million. We filed requests for appeal for the remaining unsettled claims for these review periods. In the third quarter of 2004, an administrative law judge rendered a favorable decision regarding the majority of these unsettled claims, which resulted in our recognition of $8.3 million in additional recoveries. Less than $4 million in disputed Medicare lab billings currently remain unresolved. Management fee income. Management fee income represented less than 1% of net operating revenues for 2004 and 2003. We operated or provided administrative services to 34 third party or minority owned dialysis centers as of December 31, 2004. In 2003 we acquired an outpatient vascular access management business that currently manages the vascular access component at seventeen independent third party physician practices. Our management fees are principally based on a percentage of the revenue of the managed operations. 26 Table of Contents Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and facility costs. As a percentage of current period operating revenues, patient care costs were 68% for all periods presented. On a per treatment basis, patient care costs increased approximately $7 and $11 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increases in 2004 and 2003 were principally due to higher labor costs and increases in the levels of revenue generating physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The increase in 2003 was also due to higher insurance costs. The higher labor costs reflect rising labor rates and the effect of the increase in the number of newly opened centers not yet at normal productivity levels, partially offset by general labor productivity improvements. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in 2004. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and include expenses for corporate and regional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions, and regulatory compliance oversight. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of current period operating revenues were 8.4%, 8.0% and 8.6% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In absolute dollars, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $32 million in 2004 and $6 million in 2003. The increase in 2004 principally consisted of higher labor costs, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives, and increases in support infrastructure for corporate initiatives and business expansion. The increase in 2003 was principally due to higher labor costs. The substantial increases in labor costs for 2004 and 2003 principally related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes, as well as expanding support functions. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was approximately 4% of current period operating revenues for each of the past three years. The increase in depreciation and amortization from $75 million in 2003 to $87 million in 2004 was principally due to new center developments and acquisitions. Provision for uncollectible accounts. The provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately 2% of current period operating revenues for each of the three years. During 2002, we realized recoveries of $5 million associated with aged accounts receivable that had been reserved in 1999. The recoveries resulted from improvements made in our billing and collection processes. Minority interests and equity income, net. Minority interests net of equity income increased in 2004 by approximately $7 million due to an increase in new centers having minority partners as well as growth in the earnings of our joint ventures. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, and investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. Other income Other income, which was a net of approximately $4 million, $3 million and $4 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, consisted principally of interest income. Debt expense and refinancing charges Debt expense for 2004, 2003 and 2002 consisted of interest expense of approximately $50 million, $64 million and $69 million, respectively, and amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $2 million 27 Table of Contents in 2004, and $3 million in 2003 and 2002. The decrease in interest expense in 2004 as compared to 2003 was due to changes in the mix of our debt instruments. For most of 2003 we incurred higher interest rates on our senior subordinated notes, which were paid off in the second half of 2003 and replaced with lower interest rate borrowings from our credit facility. This decrease was partially offset by the effect on interest rates from our swap agreements and higher average debt balances. The reduction in interest expense in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to lower average interest rates and lower average debt balances. Reclassification of previously reported extraordinary losses. In accordance with SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 14, and Technical Corrections, which became effective as of January 1, 2003, an after tax loss of $29.4 million in 2002 associated with the extinguishment of debt was reclassified from an extraordinary item to a pre tax refinancing charge of $49 million. In 2003, the refinancing charges of $27 million related to the consideration paid in excess of book value to redeem our Convertible Subordinated Notes and the write off of deferred financing costs and financing fees associated with the amendment of our bank credit agreement. In 2002, the refinancing charges of $49 million related to debt restructuring, which included retiring $225 million of 9 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and extinguishing our then existing senior credit facilities. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2004 represented an effective tax rate of 38.6%, compared with 39.0% and 41.0% in 2003 and 2002. The reduction in the effective tax rate for 2004 was primarily due to lower state income taxes. The reduction in the effective tax rate for 2003 was primarily due to a lower provision for state income taxes and utilization of previously unrecognized tax losses. The effective tax rate for 2005 is currently projected to be comparable to the 2004 level. Liquidity and capital resources Cash flow from operations during 2004 amounted to $420 million, including after tax Medicare lab recoveries of $17 million, compared with $294 million for 2003. Non operating cash outflows in 2004 included $128 million for capital asset expenditures including $83 million for new center developments, $265 million for acquisitions (net of divestitures), and $97 million for stock repurchases. Non operating cash outflows for 2003 included $100 million for capital asset expenditures including $58 million for new center developments, $97 million for acquisitions, and $107 million for stock repurchases. During 2004, we acquired a total of 51 dialysis centers and opened 44 new dialysis centers. During 2003 we acquired 27 dialysis centers for $84 million (including controlling ownership interests in two centers in which we previously had minority ownership) and opened 30 new dialysis centers. Other 2003 acquisitions related to ancillary operations. The largest acquisition during 2004 was the purchase of common stock of Physicians Dialysis, Inc. (PDI), for approximately $150 million, which added 24 centers. On December 6, 2004 we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Gambro Healthcare, Inc. for a purchase price of approximately $3.05 billion in cash. The timing of the closing of the acquisition transaction is dependent on the governments Hart Scott Rodino anti trust review process. In connection with the Gambro acquisition we will be assessing financing alternatives, which could include closing some or all of the financing in advance of the closing of the acquisition. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We have obtained acquisition financing commitments from a group of financial institutions, however such commitments are subject to customary conditions. We expect to spend approximately $100 million to $120 million for capital asset expenditures in 2005. This includes approximately $50 to $60 million for routine maintenance items and $50 to $60 million for new center developments. This level of capital asset expenditures is consistent with our 2004 level. We expect to open between 30 to 40 new centers in 2005. 28 Table of Contents The accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2004 and 2003 represented approximately 70 and 69 days of net revenue, net of bad debt provision. As of December 31, 2004, we had undrawn credit facilities totaling $116 million of which $23 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient borrowing capacity and operating cash flows to fund our planned acquisitions and expansions and to meet our other obligations over the next twelve months. 2004 capital structure changes. In the third quarter of 2004, we amended our existing credit facilities in order to modify certain restricted payment covenants principally for acquisitions and share repurchases and we extended the maturity of the Term Loan B until June 30, 2010. We also borrowed an additional $250 million under a new Term Loan C principally to fund potential acquisitions and share repurchases. The Term Loan C bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% for an overall effective rate of 4.16% at December 31, 2004. The aggregate annual principal payments for the amended Term Loan B and the Term Loan C are approximately $56.1 million and $11.9 million in the first five years of the agreement, and $974.2 million and $238.1 million in the sixth year, respectively. We expect to put new credit facilities in place in connection with the planned Gambro Healthcare acquisition. Under the previously announced Board authorization for share repurchases, we repurchased a total of 3,350,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $28.82 per share during 2004. On November 2, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $200 million of our common stock, from time to time, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The total outstanding Board authorizations for share repurchases are now approximately $249 million. In the first quarter of 2004, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate of 3.08%, plus the Term Loan B margin of 2.00%, for an overall effective rate of 5.08% as of December 31, 2004. The total amortizing notional amount of the swap was $135 million matched with the Term Loan B outstanding debt. The agreement expires in January 2009 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2004, the notional amount of this swap was $135 million and its fair value was an asset of $1.7 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $1.1 million, net of tax. In the third quarter of 2004, we entered into another interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate of 3.64%, plus the Term Loan C margin of 1.75%, for an overall effective rate of 5.39% as of December 31, 2004. The total $75 million non amortizing notional amount of the swap was matched with the Term Loan C outstanding debt. The agreement expires in August 2008 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2004 the fair value of the swap was an asset of $0.1 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $0.06 million, net of tax. At December 31, 2004, approximately 25% of our outstanding variable rate debt was economically fixed at an effective weighted average interest rate of 5.27% and our overall credit facility effective weighted average interest rate was 4.60% based upon current margins in effect ranging from 1.75% to 2.00%. On December 10, 2004 we entered into two forward interest rate swap agreements that will have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate at 3.875% effective July 1, 2005. The total amortizing notional amount of these two swaps is $800 million and both expire in January 2010 and require quarterly interest payments beginning in October 2005. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate notional amount of these swaps was $800 million and their fair value was an asset of $0.4 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $0.2 million, net of tax. As a result of our swap agreements, we will have over 80% of our outstanding variable rate debt economically fixed. 29 Table of Contents 2003 capital structure changes. In the first quarter of 2003, we borrowed $150 million that was available under the Term Loan A of our credit facility. The Term Loan A bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00% for an overall effective rate of 3.19% at December 31, 2003. In July 2003, we completed a call for redemption of all of our outstanding $125 million 5 5/8% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 by issuing 7,302,528 shares of our common stock from treasury stock for the conversion of nearly all the 5 5/8% Notes, and redeemed the balance for cash and accrued interest. In July 2003, we also entered into an amended credit agreement in order to, among other things, lower the overall interest rate. We also acquired an additional $200 million of borrowings under the replacement Term Loan B, which amounted to $1.042 billion. In November 2003, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement in order to again lower the interest rate on the Term Loan B and to modify certain covenants. In 2003 we completed a call for redemption of our $345 million, 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009. The 7% notes were redeemed for $363 million in cash, including accrued interest and 24,045 shares of common stock. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate of 3.39%, plus the Term Loan B margin of 2.00% for an overall effective rate of 5.39% as of December 31, 2004. The total amortizing notional amount of this swap was $135 million and was matched with Term Loan B outstanding debt. The agreement expires in November 2008 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2004, the notional amount of this swap was approximately $135 million and its fair value was an asset of $0.6 million which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $1.3 million, net of tax. During 2003, we repurchased a total of 5,162,850 shares of our common stock for approximately $107 million, or an average of $20.76 per share, pursuant to authorizations by the Board of Directors. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Nearly all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers, in the form of put options exercisable at the third party owners discretion. These put obligations, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital as needed to several third party centers including minority owned centers and centers that we operate under administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2004 (in millions): WithinOne Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 52 $ 80 $ 629 $ 607 $ 1,368 Capital lease obligations 1 4 1 2 8 Operating leases 74 132 102 189 497 $ 127 $ 216 $ 732 $ 798 $ 1,873 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 23 $ 23 Acquisition of dialysis centers 56 15 19 13 103 Working capital advances to third parties under administrative services agreements 15 15 $ 94 $ 15 $ 19 $ 13 $ 141 30 Table of Contents Contingencies Our revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements; and (5) claims for refunds from private payors. On October 25, 2004, we received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office, or U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. The subpoena covers the period from 1996 to present and requires the production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including our laboratory services. The subpoena also includes specific requests for documents relating to testing for parathyroid hormone levels, or PTH, and to products relating to vitamin D therapies. We believe that the subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena, including Fresenius Medical Care, Renal Care Group and Gambro Healthcare. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Compliance with the subpoena will require management attention and legal expense. We cannot predict whether legal proceedings will be initiated against us relating to this investigation or, if proceedings are initiated, the outcome of any such proceedings. In addition, criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. If a court determines that there has been wrongdoing, the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial. In February 2001 the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and financial relationships with physicians. We cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the U.S. Attorneys Office. In May 2002, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office and the Philadelphia Office of the OIG. The subpoena requires an update to the information we provided in our response to the February 2001 request, and also seeks a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services, as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The subpoena covers the period from May 1996 to May 2002. We have provided the documents requested and continue to cooperate with the United States Attorneys Office and the OIG in its investigation. If this review proceeds, the government could expand its areas of concern. If a court determines that there has been wrongdoing, the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these additional pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts, impairments and valuation adjustments, and accounting for income taxes, are considered 31 Table of Contents to be critical in evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize for a reporting period. The rates at which we are reimbursed are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the more than 1,500 commercial healthcare plans under which we receive reimbursements, often arbitrary and inconsistent reimbursements by commercial payors, ongoing insurance coverage changes, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on a) the reimbursement rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the reimbursement rates paid by the government payor (eg. 80% for Medicare patients) and b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (eg. Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for reimbursements, and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 50,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. Our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk is generally expected to be within 1% of total revenue, which can represent as much as 5% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses. For example, we recognized $22 million of prior period dialysis revenue in 2001 related to cash recoveries in excess of previous estimates made possible by improvements in our billing and collecting operations. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received after considering possible retroactive adjustments that may be made as a result of the ongoing third party carrier review. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as applicable. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset 32 Table of Contents will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, awards and benefit plan contributions, are updated periodically due to changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results may vary due to the subjective nature of fulfilling employee specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Significant new accounting standard for 2005 In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 123R, Share Based Payment, that amends FASB Statements No. 123 and 95, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. This statement requires a company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, such as stock options, based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize such cost over the requisite period during which an employee provides service. The grant date fair value will be determined using option pricing models adjusted for unique characteristics of the equity instruments. The statement also addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the Companys equity instruments or that may be settled through the issuance of such equity instruments. The statement does not change the accounting for transactions in which a company issues equity instruments for services to non employees or the accounting for employee stock ownership plans. This statement is effective beginning in the third quarter of 2005, and requires us to recognize compensation costs on outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. We currently project that the adoption of this standard will reduce pre tax income by less than $10 million for the second half of 2005. 33 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including the risks discussed below. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements under the heading Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. If the average rates that private payors pay us decline, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced. Approximately 40% of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have private payors as the primary payor. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us on terms and at rates materially higher than Medicare rates. Based on our recent experience in negotiating with private payors, we believe that pressure from private payors to decrease the rates they pay us may increase. If the average rates that private payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. If the number of patients with higher paying commercial insurance declines, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced. Our revenue levels are sensitive to the percentage of our reimbursements from higher paying commercial plans. A patients insurance coverage may change for a number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the patients or a family members employment status. For a patient covered by an employer group health plan, Medicare generally becomes the primary payor after 33 months, or earlier if the patients employer group health plan coverage terminates. When Medicare becomes the primary payor, the payment rate we receive for that patient shifts from the employer group health plan rate to the Medicare reimbursement rate. If there is a significant reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans relative to government based programs that pay at lower rates it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Future declines, or the lack of further increases, in Medicare reimbursement rates would reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Approximately one half of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have Medicare as their primary payor. The Medicare ESRD program reimburses us for dialysis and ancillary services at fixed rates. Unlike most other Medicare programs, the Medicare ESRD program does not provide for periodic inflation increases in reimbursement rates. Increases of 1.2% in 2000 and 2.4% in 2001 were the first increases in the composite reimbursement rate since 1991, and were significantly less than the cumulative rate of inflation over the same period. For 2002 through 2004, there was no increase in the composite reimbursement rate. Effective January 1, 2005, there was an increase of only 1.6%. Increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, have occurred and are expected to continue to occur regardless of whether there is a compensating increase in reimbursement rates. We cannot predict with certainty the nature or extent of future rate changes, if any. To the extent these rates decline or are not adjusted to keep pace with inflation, our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be adversely affected. Changes in the structure of, and reimbursement rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. The Medicare composite reimbursement rate covers the cost of treatment, including the supplies used in those treatments, specified laboratory tests and certain pharmaceuticals. Other services and pharmaceuticals, including EPO, vitamin D analogs and iron supplements, are separately billed. Changes to the structure of the composite rate and separately billable reimbursement rates became effective on January 1, 2005. These changes 34 Table of Contents more than offset the 1.6% composite rate increase that also became effective January 1, 2005. In addition, effective April 1, 2005, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, plans to implement a case mix adjustment payment methodology which is designed to pay differential composite service rates based on a variety of patient characteristics. If the case mix adjustment is not properly implemented it could adversely affect the Medicare reimbursement rates. Future changes in the structure of, and reimbursement rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. CMS continues to study the ESRD reimbursement system through a number of demonstration projects which will take place over the next few years. The changes that went into effect on January 1, 2005 include changes in the way we are reimbursed for certain pharmaceuticals that are currently billed outside the composite rate. Pharmaceuticals are approximately one half of our total Medicare revenues. If Medicare begins to include in its composite reimbursement rate pharmaceuticals, laboratory services or other ancillary services that it currently reimburses separately, or if there are further changes to or decreases in the reimbursement rate for these items without a corresponding increase in the composite rate, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Changes in state Medicaid programs or reimbursement rates could reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. More than 5% of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have Medicaid as their primary coverage. State governments may propose reductions in reimbursement rates, limitations on eligibility or other changes to Medicaid programs from time to time. If state governments reduce the rates paid by those programs for dialysis and related services, limit eligibility for Medicaid coverage or adopt changes similar to those adopted by Medicare, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected. Changes in clinical practices and reimbursement rates or rules for EPO and other pharmaceuticals could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. The administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals accounts for approximately 40% of our total dialysis revenues. Changes in physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices, changes in private and governmental reimbursement criteria, the introduction of new pharmaceuticals and the conversion to alternate types of administration could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. For example, some Medicare fiscal intermediaries (Medicare claims processing contractors) are seeking to implement local medical review policies for EPO and vitamin D analogs that would effectively limit utilization of and reimbursement for these pharmaceuticals. CMS has proposed a draft reimbursement policy that would direct all fiscal intermediaries with respect to reimbursement coverage for EPO. It is possible that the draft policy, if finalized, will affect physician prescription patterns and the timing of our cash flows due to changes in auditing methodology by fiscal intermediaries. Adverse developments with respect to EPO and the introduction of Aranesp&reg; could materially reduce our earnings and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients. Amgen is the sole supplier of EPO and may unilaterally decide to increase its price for EPO at any time. For example, Amgen unilaterally increased its base price for EPO by 3.9% in each of 2002, 2001 and 2000. Although we have entered into contracts for EPO pricing for a fixed time period that includes discount variables depending on certain clinical criteria and other criteria, we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the discount structure for EPO that we currently receive, or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of discounts within that structure as we have historically achieved. An increase in the cost of EPO could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows. Amgen has developed and obtained FDA approval for Aranesp&reg;, a new pharmaceutical used to treat anemia that may replace EPO or reduce its use with dialysis patients. Unlike EPO, which is generally administered in 35 Table of Contents conjunction with each dialysis treatment, Aranesp&reg; can remain effective for between two and three weeks. In the event that Amgen begins to market Aranesp&reg; for the treatment of dialysis patients, we may realize lower margins on the administration of Aranesp&reg; than are currently realized with EPO. In addition, some physicians may begin to administer Aranesp&reg; in their offices, which would prevent us from recognizing revenue or profit from the administration of EPO or Aranesp&reg; to those physicians patients. A significant increase in the use of Aranesp&reg; would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. The investigation related to the subpoena we received on October 25, 2004 from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York could result in substantial penalties against us. We are voluntarily cooperating with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and the OIG with respect to the subpoena we received on October 25, 2004, which requested a wide range of documents, including specific documents relating to testing of parathyroid hormone levels and products relating to vitamin D therapies. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena including Gambro Healthcare, Fresenius Medical Care and Renal Care Group. The U.S. Attorneys Office has also requested information regarding our Florida laboratory. Compliance with the subpoena will require management attention and legal expense. We are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved, whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters, financial or otherwise. In addition, criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. The pending federal review related to the subpoena we received in May 2002 from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania could result in substantial penalties against us. We are voluntarily cooperating with the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the OIG in a review of some historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures, financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies, and the provision of pharmaceutical and other ancillary services, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services. The U.S. Attorneys Office has also requested and received information regarding certain of our laboratories. We are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved, whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters, financial or otherwise. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations, federal and state anti kickback laws, Stark II physician self referral prohibition and analogous state referral statutes, and federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information. The regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers, including dialysis providers, has increased significantly in recent years. Medicare has increased the frequency and intensity of its certification surveys and inspections of dialysis centers have increased markedly in recent years. In addition, fiscal intermediaries are increasing their prepayment and post payment reviews. We endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with the anti kickback laws and the Stark II physicians self referral law. However, the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations. For example, none of our medical director agreements establishes compensation using the anti kickback safe harbor method; rather, compensation under our medical director agreements is the result of individual negotiation and the Company believes exceeds amounts determined in that manner. If an enforcement agency were to challenge the level of compensation that we pay our medical directors, we could be required to 36 Table of Contents change our practices, face criminal or civil penalties, pay substantial fines or otherwise experience a material adverse effect as a result of a challenge to these arrangements. Due to regulatory considerations unique to each of these states, all of our dialysis operations in New York and some of our dialysis operations in New Jersey are conducted by privately owned companies to which we provide a broad range of administrative services. These operations account for approximately 6% of our dialysis revenues. We believe that we have structured these operations to comply with the laws and regulations of these states, but we can give no assurances that they will not be challenged. If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows including: Mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses; Suspension or termination of our participation in government reimbursement programs; Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable reimbursement program requirements; Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government reimbursement programs; Loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate, including the loss of revenues from operations in New York and New Jersey conducted by privately owned companies as described above; Fines, damages or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations, Stark II violations, submission of false claims, civil or criminal liability based on violations of law, or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements and patient privacy law violations; Claims for monetary damages from patients who believe their protected health information has been used or disclosed in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws; and Termination of relationships with medical directors. We may be subject to liability claims for damages and other expenses not covered by insurance that could reduce our earnings and cash flows. The administration of dialysis and related services to patients may subject us to litigation and liability for damages. Our business, profitability and growth prospects could suffer if we face negative publicity or we pay damages or defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope of any applicable insurance coverage. We currently maintain programs of general and professional liability insurance. However, a successful professional liability, malpractice or negligence claim in excess of our insurance coverage could harm our profitability and liquidity. In addition, if our costs of insurance and claims increase, then our earnings could decline. Market rates for insurance premiums and deductibles have been steadily increasing. Our earnings and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following: Further increases in premiums and deductibles; Increases in the number of liability claims against us or the cost of settling or trying cases related to those claims; and An inability to obtain one or more types of insurance on acceptable terms. If businesses we acquire have unknown liabilities, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Our business strategy includes the acquisition of dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate dialysis centers. Businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities or liabilities that are in excess of the amounts that we had estimated. These liabilities could include liabilities arising as a result of any failure to adhere to laws and regulations governing dialysis operations, such as violations of federal or state anti kickback statutes or Stark II. Although we generally seek indemnification from the sellers of businesses we acquire for 37 Table of Contents matters that are not properly disclosed to us, we are not always successful. In addition, even in cases where we are able to obtain indemnification, we may discover liabilities greater than the contractual limits or the financial resources of the indemnifying party. In the event that we are responsible for liabilities substantially in excess of any amounts recovered through rights to indemnification, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced. Many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at dialysis centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical directors of the centers. As a result, the primary referral source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center. If a medical director agreement terminates, whether before or at the end of its term, and a new medical director is appointed, it may negatively impact the former medical directors decision to treat his or her patients at our center. Additionally, both current and former medical directors have no obligation to refer their patients to our centers. Also, if the quality of service levels at our centers deteriorate, it may negatively impact patient referrals and treatment volumes. Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally five to ten years. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us. As of January 1, 2005, there were 59 centers, accounting for approximately 9% of our 2004 treatment volume, at which the medical director agreements require renewal on or before December 31, 2005. We may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships to assure compliance with the safe harbor provisions of the anti kickback statute, Stark II law and other similar laws. These actions could negatively impact the decision of physicians to extend their medical director agreements with us or to refer their patients to us. If the terms of any existing agreement are found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship which could lead to the early termination of the agreement, or force the physician to stop referring patients to the centers. If our joint ventures were found to violate the law, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. As of December 31, 2004 we operated 128 dialysis centers, representing approximately 15% of our dialysis revenue, that are owned by joint ventures in which we own a controlling interest and one or more physicians or physician practice groups have a minority interest. The physician owners may also provide medical director services to those centers or other centers we own and operate. Because our relationships with physicians are governed by the anti kickback statute contained in the Social Security Act, we have sought to structure our joint venture arrangements to satisfy as many safe harbor requirements as possible. However, our joint venture arrangements do not satisfy all elements of any safe harbor under the federal anti kickback statute. Based on the exceptions applicable to ESRD services, we believe that our joint venture arrangements and operations materially comply with the Stark II law. If the joint ventures are found to be in violation of the anti kickback statute or the Stark provisions, we could be required to restructure the joint ventures or refuse to accept referrals for designated health services from the physicians with whom the joint venture centers have a financial relationship. We also could be required to repay to Medicare amounts received by the joint ventures pursuant to prohibited referrals, and we could be subject to monetary penalties and exclusion from government healthcare programs. If our joint venture centers are subject to any of these penalties, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. 38 Table of Contents The level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business. We have substantial debt outstanding and if we consummate the proposed Gambro Healthcare acquisition we will incur substantial additional debt. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The level of our current and proposed indebtedness, among other things, could: make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt securities; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes; expose us to interest rate fluctuations because the interest on the debt under some of our indebtedness may be at variable rates; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. If additional debt financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to grow our business, take advantage of business opportunities, respond to competitive pressures or refinance maturing debt, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. We will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts, including any strategic acquisitions we may make in the future, will depend on our ability to generate cash. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that our currently anticipated growth in revenue and cash flow will be realized on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Our senior secured credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets. As such, our ability to refinance our debt or seek additional financing could be limited by such security interest. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel continues, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses. We are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. We compete for nurses with hospitals and other health care providers. This nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations. If we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, our operations and treatment growth will be negatively impacted, which would result in reduced revenues, earnings and cash flows. 39 Table of Contents Provisions in our charter documents, compensation programs and Delaware law may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests. Our charter documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent, requiring 90 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our Board of Directors and granting our Board of Directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval, and a poison pill that would substantially dilute the interest sought by an acquirer that our Board of Directors does not approve. In addition, most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control. We have also adopted a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock awards, which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. Based on the shares of our common stock outstanding and the market price of our stock on December 31, 2004, these cash bonuses would total approximately $149 million if a control transaction occurred at that price and our Board of Directors did not modify the program. These compensation programs may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law that, subject to exceptions, would prohibit us from engaging in any business combinations with any interested stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder. These restrictions may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of our Company. These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our Company at a price that our stockholders may find attractive. These provisions could also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. The Gambro Healthcare acquisition is significantly larger than any other acquisition we have made to date. We will face challenges integrating the Gambro Healthcare centers and may not realize anticipated benefits. The Gambro Healthcare acquisition is the largest acquisition we have attempted to date. There is a risk that, due to the size of the acquisition, we will be unable to integrate Gambro Healthcare into our operations as effectively as we have with prior acquisitions, which would result in fewer benefits to us from the acquisition than currently anticipated as well as increased costs. The integration of the Gambro Healthcare operations will require implementation of appropriate operations, management and financial reporting systems and controls. We may experience difficulties in effectively implementing these and other systems and integrating Gambro Healthcares systems and operations. In addition, the integration of Gambro Healthcare will require the focused attention of our management team, including a significant commitment of their time and resources. The need for management to focus on integration matters, could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues and operating results. If the integration is not successful or if our Gambro Healthcare operations are less profitable than we currently anticipate, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. We will assume substantially all of Gambro Healthcares liabilities, including contingent liabilities. If these liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are unknown Gambro Healthcare obligations, our business could be materially and adversely affected. As a result of the Gambro Healthcare acquisition, we will assume substantially all of Gambro Healthcares liabilities, including contingent liabilities. We may learn additional information about Gambro Healthcares 40 Table of Contents business that adversely affects us, such as unknown liabilities, issues relating to internal controls over financial reporting, issues that could affect our ability to comply with the Sarbanes Oxley Act after we acquire Gambro Healthcare or issues that could affect our ability to comply with other applicable laws, including laws and regulations governing dialysis operations. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Gambro Healthcare acquisition will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. Among other things, if Gambro Healthcares liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are obligations of Gambro Healthcare of which we are not aware at the time of completion of the acquisition, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We have limited indemnification rights in connection with these and other regulatory compliance and litigation matters affecting Gambro Healthcare, as well as known contingent liabilities of Gambro Healthcare that we will assume. For example, Gambro Healthcare was served a complaint regarding a former employee and a putative class of employees in California for claims relating to California labor laws. Although this matter is subject to indemnification under the acquisition agreement, claims relating to this matter may exceed the limit on our indemnification rights. Gambro Healthcare may also have other unknown liabilities which we will be responsible for after the acquisition. If we are responsible for liabilities not covered by indemnification rights or substantially in excess of amounts covered through any indemnification rights, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. The integration of Gambro Healthcare and the realization of cost savings will require us to make significant expenditures. In order to obtain the cost savings and operating income that we believe the integration of Gambro Healthcare should provide, we will be required to make significant expenditures. We are in the early stages of planning for the integration process and are uncertain as to the extent and amount of these expenditures. Further, given the amount of indebtedness that we will incur as part of the Gambro Healthcare acquisition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing required for any significant expenditures on favorable terms or at all. In addition, we may not achieve the cost savings we expect through the integration of the Gambro Healthcare operations regardless of our expenditures, which failure would materially and adversely affect our financial results. The costs associated with compliance with the corporate integrity agreement could be substantial and may be greater than we currently anticipate. If we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for Gambro Healthcare employees after the acquisition, we may not be able to effectively integrate their operations. In order to successfully integrate the Gambro Healthcare operations into our own, we will require the services of Gambro Healthcares clinical, operating and administrative employees. If we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for Gambro Healthcare employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate Gambro Healthcares systems and operations. If we lose the services of a significant number of Gambro Healthcares medical directors, our results of operations could be harmed. Certain of Gambro Healthcares contracts with its medical directors provide that the contract is terminable upon a change of control of Gambro Healthcare. These termination provisions would be triggered by our acquisition of Gambro Healthcare. If we lose the services of a significant number of Gambro Healthcares medical directors, our results of operations may be harmed. Our alliance and product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products Inc. will limit our ability to achieve costs savings with respect to products and equipment we are required to purchase under this agreement. In connection with the Gambro Healthcare acquisition, we will enter into a ten year alliance and product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products Inc., a subsidiary of Gambro AB, pursuant to which we will be 41 Table of Contents required to purchase from Gambro Renal Products specified percentages of our requirements for hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices. This will limit our ability to realize future cost savings in regard to these products and equipment. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, our total spending on hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment was approximately 8% of our total operating costs. If Gambro Renal Products is unable to fulfill its obligations under the agreement, we may have difficulty finding alternative sources of supplies on favorable financial terms, further reducing our ability to achieve cost savings. In addition, as we replace existing equipment from other third party manufacturers with Gambro Renal Products equipment, we may incur additional expenses as we transition to this new equipment. The consummation of the Gambro Healthcare acquisition is subject to a number of conditions; if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, we will not be able to consummate the acquisition. The stock purchase agreement relating to the Gambro Healthcare acquisition contains a number of conditions which must be satisfied or waived prior to the closing of the acquisition. These conditions include, among others, execution and delivery of the transition services agreement and the alliance product and supply agreement and receipt of regulatory approvals, including antitrust clearance. On February 18, 2005, we received a request from the Federal Trade Commission for additional information in connection with its review of our anti trust filing. We intend to respond promptly to this request. The effect of the second request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the Hart Scott Rodino Act until thirty days after we and Gambro Healthcare have substantially complied with the request, unless that period is extended voluntarily by us and Gambro Healthcare or is terminated sooner by the FTC. In addition, one or more states Attorneys General could attempt to impose conditions or otherwise interfere with the proposed acquisition. In connection with obtaining antitrust clearance, we may decide to, or the Federal Trade Commission or other regulatory agencies with jurisdiction may request that we divest certain of our or Gambro Healthcares dialysis centers. These divestitures could be material. In addition, we will require financing in order to consummate the Gambro Healthcare acquisition. We have obtained acquisition financing commitments from a group of financial institutions, however such commitments are subject to customary conditions. We therefore cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all or that we will be able to consummate the Gambro Healthcare acquisition on the terms described herein or at all. If we do not cause Gambro Healthcare to comply and Gambro Healthcare does not comply with its corporate integrity agreement, or Gambro Healthcare otherwise has failed or fails to comply with applicable government regulations to its operations, we could be subject to additional penalties and otherwise may be materially harmed. On December 1, 2004, Gambro Healthcare entered into a settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States government relating to the Department of Justices investigation of Gambro Healthcares Medicare and Medicaid billing practices and its relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers. In connection with the settlement agreement, Gambro Healthcare, without admitting liability, made a one time payment of approximately $310 million and entered into a corporate integrity agreement with HHS. In addition, its subsidiary, Gambro Supply Corp., entered a plea of guilty to a one count felony charge related to the conduct of its predecessor, REN Supply Corp., and paid a criminal fine of $25 million. Gambro Supply Corp. was excluded from participation in federal health care programs. However, no other Gambro AB affiliates were so excluded. Gambro Healthcare also agreed to voluntarily cooperate with the government in connection with its further investigation. The corporate integrity agreement applies to all of Gambro Healthcares centers and requires, among other things, that Gambro Healthcare implement additional training, engage an independent review organization to conduct an annual review of certain of its reimbursement claims, and submit to the OIG an annual report with respect to its compliance activities. Moreover, Gambro Healthcare has reached a preliminary understanding with the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units to settle the related claims of the affected state Medicaid programs for a one time payment of $15 million plus interest accruing at the rate of 5% per annum from December 1, 2004. Completion of the Medicaid settlement is subject to confirmation of certain claims data and negotiation and execution of settlement 42 Table of Contents agreements with the relevant states. As a result of the settlement agreement, private payors and other third parties may initiate legal proceedings against Gambro Healthcare related to the billing practices and other matters covered by the settlement agreement. If we do not cause Gambro Healthcare to comply, and Gambro Healthcare does not comply, with the terms of the corporate integrity agreement or otherwise has failed or fails to comply with the extensive federal, state and local government regulations applicable to its operations, we could be subject to additional penalties, including monetary penalties or suspension from participation in government reimbursement programs, and otherwise may be materially harmed. The costs associated with compliance with the corporate integrity agreement and cooperation with the government could be substantial and may be greater than we currently anticipate. 43 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2004. For our debt obligations with variable interest rates, the rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of 2004 including the economic effects of our swap agreements. These rates are based on LIBOR plus margins based upon performance and leverage criteria plus the impact from the swap agreements. The margins currently in effect range from 1.75% to 2.00%. Expected maturity date Total Fair Value Average interest rate 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 5 $ 1 $ 3 $ 3 $ 13 $ 13 5.53 % Variable rate $ 48 $ 55 $ 25 $ 15 $ 614 $ 606 $ 1,363 $ 1,363 4.63 % Our senior credit facility is based on a floating LIBOR interest rate plus a margin, which is reset periodically and can be locked in for a maximum of six months. As a result, our interest expense is subject to fluctuations as LIBOR interest rates change. We have entered into three interest rate swap agreements, two matched on our Term Loan B outstanding debt and one matched on our Term Loan C outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2004, the total notional amount of these swap agreements was $345 million and the interest rates were economically modified to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 3.64% plus the Term Loan margins ranging from 1.75% to 2.00%, in effect as of December 31, 2004. This resulted in an overall effective rate of 5.27% as of December 31, 2004, on approximately 25% of our outstanding debt. Two of the swap agreements expire in 2008 and one in 2009. As of December 31, 2004, the fair value of the swaps was an asset of $2.4 million. As a result of these swap agreements, our overall effective weighted average interest rate of our credit facility was 4.60% based upon current margins in effect ranging from 1.75% to 2.00% as of December 31, 2004. We also have entered into two forward interest rate swap agreements that will have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to become a fixed rate at 3.875% effective July 1, 2005. The total amortizing notional amount of the two swaps is $800 million and both expire in January 2010 and require quarterly interest payments beginning in October 2005. As of December 31, 2004, the fair value of these swaps was an asset of $0.4 million. As a result of all of our swap agreements, we will have over 80% of our outstanding variable rate debt economically fixed. One means of assessing exposure to interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $5.9 million, $6.5 million and $3.5 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk. 44 Table of Contents

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Annual report on Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements that do not concern historical facts are forward looking statements and include among other things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, and capital expenditures. These statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements, including, but not limited to, risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, and the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients, possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, and legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the ongoing review by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and the OIG and the subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and our ability to complete acquisitions of businesses, including the consummation of the Gambro Healthcare acquisition, terms of the related financing, and subsequent integration of the business. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, other than in connection with our quarterly reporting on Form 10 Q or in our Annual Report on Form 10 K, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview Our stated mission is to be the provider, employer and partner of choice. We believe our attention to these three areas our patients, our teammates, and our business partners represent the major drivers of our long term success, aside from external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes have improved over each of the past three years, and we ended 2004 with the best clinical outcomes that we have ever achieved. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. Over the past three years we have achieved significant reductions in teammate turnover, which has been a major contributor to our performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. We are pleased with the overall clinical, operating and financial performance levels achieved over the past three years. Although our business has areas of significant potential exposure, as delineated in the risk factors following this discussion and analysis, our operating results over the past three years have not been significantly adversely affected by these risk factors. Our operations represent a single reporting segment, with approximately 96% of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis services, of which 88% represents on site dialysis services in 624 centers that are wholly owned or majority owned. Our other direct dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our center operations, relate to patient performed peritoneal dialysis and acute treatments in hospitals. 22 Table of Contents The principal drivers of our revenue are a) the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week, and b) average treatment revenue. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our pace of opening and acquiring new centers. Our year over year treatment volume growth for 2004 was 10.8%, compared with 6.7% and 5.0% for 2003 and 2002. Approximately 40% of our growth in each of the last two years was associated with new centers, and approximately 60% was attributable to increased treatments. Average revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) treatments, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government reimbursement rates, and our dialysis services charge capture, billing and collecting operations performance. On average, reimbursement rates from commercial payors are more than double Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment. The percent of patients under government reimbursement programs to total dialysis center patients increased approximately 1% over the past two years, and is currently approximately 79%. In terms of revenue dollars, approximately 60% of our total dialysis revenue is from government or government based programs. Government reimbursement rates are principally determined by federal (Medicare) and state (Medicaid) policy, have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reductions. Medicare reimbursements represent approximately 50% of our dialysis revenue, and cumulative increases since 1990 total approximately 5%. There were no Medicare reimbursement rate increases for 2003 and 2004. A 1.6% increase became effective on January 1, 2005, however this increase will be more than offset by other structural changes to Medicare dialysis reimbursement rates that also became effective January 1, 2005. Medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures. Approximately 40% of our dialysis revenue is from commercial healthcare plans and contracted managed care payors. Commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Over the past three years we have been successful in maintaining a relatively stable average reimbursement rate in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases. Approximately 40% of our dialysis revenue has been associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, and therefore changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, and pharmaceutical intensities significantly influence our revenue levels. Such changes, driven by physician practice patterns and protocols focused on improving clinical outcomes, have accounted for a significant portion of the increase in average revenue per treatment over the past three years. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services charge capture, billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average revenue per treatment is actually realized. Over the past three years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that have helped improve our operating performance and reduce our regulatory compliance risks. Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with predicting third party reimbursements in the healthcare industry, our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. 23 Table of Contents Our annual average revenue per treatment increased from $291 in 2002 to $303 in 2003 and to $312 in 2004. These increases were principally due to increases in our standard fee schedules (impacting non contracted commercial revenue), changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial contract negotiations, and continued improvements in revenue capture, billing and collection operations, while maintaining a relatively stable mix of commercial patients and commercial rates. The principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost changes such as increased insurance costs experienced in 2003. Our average clinical hours per treatment has improved over the past three years primarily because of reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in 2004, and federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. Labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends. For the past three years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors, and expect relatively stable pricing through 2005. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenue over the past three years. However, this reflects substantial increases in spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes, legal and other professional fees, and expanding support functions. We expect that these higher levels of general and administrative expenses will be generally maintained to support our long term initiatives and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Although other revenues represent less than 5% of total revenues, successful resolutions of disputed Medicare billings at our Florida lab resulted in recoveries related to prior years services being recognized as current period revenue and operating income of $8 million, $24 million, and $59 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The carrier began making payments on Medicare lab billings in the third quarter of 2002 after four years of withholding all payments. Therefore we were able to begin recognizing Medicare lab revenue as services were provided, incrementally increasing income by such revenue. Medicare lab revenues for 2004 current year services amounted to $34 million. Gambro Healthcare Acquisition. On December 6, 2004, we entered into an agreement to acquire Gambro Healthcare, Inc., or Gambro Healthcare, a subsidiary of Gambro AB, one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, for a purchase price of approximately $3.05 billion in cash. We currently plan to finance this transaction and refinance our existing credit facility through the issuance of notes and the entry into a new senior secured credit facility. In conjunction with the acquisition, we are entering into a 10 year product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products Inc., a subsidiary of Gambro AB, to provide a significant majority of our dialysis equipment and supplies. We expect that the acquisition will increase our revenues by more than 80% based on 2004 levels. The timing of the completion of the acquisition transaction is dependent on the governments Hart Scott Rodino antitrust review process. On February 18, 2005, the Company received a request from the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, for additional information in connection with the acquisition. The request extends the waiting period imposed by the Hart Scott Rodino Act until thirty days after the Company and Gambro Healthcare have substantially complied with the request, unless that period is voluntarily extended by the parties or is terminated sooner by the FTC. In connection with obtaining antitrust clearance, we may decide to, or the FTC or other regulatory agencies with jurisdiction may require us to, divest certain of our or Gambro Healthcares dialysis centers. Outlook for 2005. We are currently targeting operating income to be between 2% and 6% higher than the 2004 level, exclusive of the effects of the Gambro Healthcare acquisition and related debt financing, and exclusive of the expensing of stock options required by FASB No. 123R. In connection with the Gambro acquisition the Company will be assessing financing alternatives, which could include closing some or all of the financing in advance of the closing of the acquisition. At this time, we expect the Gambro Healthcare acquisition together with the related debt financing to be dilutive to earnings per share, or EPS, in the first year after the 24 Table of Contents closing of the acquisition, neutral in the second year, and accretive thereafter. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients, possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, our ability to maintain contracts with our physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the ongoing review by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the OIG and the subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York, and our ability to complete acquisitions of businesses, including the consummation of the Gambro acquisition, terms of the related financing, and subsequent integration of the businesses. You should read Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. Results of operations Following is a summary of operating results for reference in the discussion that follows: Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, except per treatment data) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 2,291 100 % $ 1,992 100 % $ 1,796 100 % Prior years services laboratory 8 24 59 2,299 2,016 1,855 Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 1,555 68 % 1,361 68 % 1,218 68 % General and administrative 192 8 % 160 8 % 154 9 % Depreciation and amortization 87 4 % 75 4 % 64 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 41 2 % 36 2 % 32 2 % Recoveries (5 ) Minority interests and equity income, net 14 7 8 Total operating expenses and charges 1,889 1,638 1,471 Operating income including prior years recoveries, (i.e., including amounts in italics) $ 410 $ 379 $ 384 Dialysis treatments 7,062,424 6,373,894 5,975,280 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 22,528 20,377 19,090 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 312 $ 303 $ 291 Net operating revenues Dialysis revenues represented approximately 96% of net operating revenues in 2004, and 97% in 2003 and 2002. Lab and other ancillary services and management fee income accounted for the balance of revenues. Operating revenues for current period services increased 15% in 2004 and 11% in 2003. Approximately 11% and 7% of the increases in revenue for 2004 and 2003 were due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments and approximately 3% and 4% was attributable to increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment. The balance of the increase in 2004 was due to additional lab, management fees and ancillary revenue. Dialysis revenues. Dialysis services include outpatient center hemodialysis, home dialysis and inpatient hemodialysis under contracts with hospitals, which accounted for approximately 88%, 7% and 5% of total 25 Table of Contents dialysis revenues, respectively. Major components of dialysis revenues include the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents approximately 40% of total dialysis revenues. Approximately 60% of our total dialysis revenues are from government based programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, with the balance from more than 600 commercial payors under more than 1500 commercial healthcare plans and approximately 300 managed care contracts. Approximately 50% of our total dialysis revenues are associated with Medicare patients, who represent nearly 70% of our total patients. Services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans are paid on average at more than double the Medicare or Medicaid rates. Patients covered by employer group health plans convert to Medicare after a maximum of 33 months. As of year end 2004, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $121 and $144 per treatment, or an overall average of $131 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. The majority of our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated reimbursement rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. The commercial reimbursement rates are under continuous downward pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the reimbursement rates normally decline substantially. No single payor accounts for more than 5% of total dialysis revenues. The number of dialysis treatments increased 10.8% in 2004 and 6.7% in 2003. Acquisitions accounted for 5.8% and 2.8% of treatment growth for 2004 and 2003. Non acquired treatment growth was 5.0% and 3.9% for 2004 and 2003. The average dialysis revenues recognized per treatment was $312, $303 and $291 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in average dialysis revenues per treatment in 2004 and 2003 was principally due to commercial rate increases and changes in intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The average dialysis revenues per treatment for the fourth quarter of 2004 was approximately $311. Our mix of commercial patients and commercial rates, which is a major profitability factor, remained relatively stable during 2004. Lab and other services. A third party carrier review of Medicare reimbursement claims associated with our Florida based laboratory was initiated in 1998. Prior to the third quarter 2002, no Medicare payments had been received since May 1998. Following a favorable ruling by an administrative law judge in June 2002 relating to review periods from January 1995 to March 1998, the carrier began releasing funds for lab services provided subsequent to May 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the carrier also released funds for certain claims in review periods from April 1998 through May 2001. During the second half of 2002, the carrier paid us a total of $69 million. Approximately $10 million of these collections related to 2002 lab services provided through June 2002, and the balance of $59 million related to prior years services. In addition to paying the prior period claims, the carrier also began processing billings for current period services in the third quarter of 2002, at which time we began recognizing current period Medicare lab revenue. In late 2003 the carriers hearing officer rendered partially favorable decisions relating to review periods from April 1998 to May 2000, resulting in our recognition of additional recoveries of $24 million. We filed requests for appeal for the remaining unsettled claims for these review periods. In the third quarter of 2004, an administrative law judge rendered a favorable decision regarding the majority of these unsettled claims, which resulted in our recognition of $8.3 million in additional recoveries. Less than $4 million in disputed Medicare lab billings currently remain unresolved. Management fee income. Management fee income represented less than 1% of net operating revenues for 2004 and 2003. We operated or provided administrative services to 34 third party or minority owned dialysis centers as of December 31, 2004. In 2003 we acquired an outpatient vascular access management business that currently manages the vascular access component at seventeen independent third party physician practices. Our management fees are principally based on a percentage of the revenue of the managed operations. 26 Table of Contents Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and facility costs. As a percentage of current period operating revenues, patient care costs were 68% for all periods presented. On a per treatment basis, patient care costs increased approximately $7 and $11 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increases in 2004 and 2003 were principally due to higher labor costs and increases in the levels of revenue generating physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The increase in 2003 was also due to higher insurance costs. The higher labor costs reflect rising labor rates and the effect of the increase in the number of newly opened centers not yet at normal productivity levels, partially offset by general labor productivity improvements. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in 2004. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and include expenses for corporate and regional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions, and regulatory compliance oversight. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of current period operating revenues were 8.4%, 8.0% and 8.6% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In absolute dollars, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $32 million in 2004 and $6 million in 2003. The increase in 2004 principally consisted of higher labor costs, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives, and increases in support infrastructure for corporate initiatives and business expansion. The increase in 2003 was principally due to higher labor costs. The substantial increases in labor costs for 2004 and 2003 principally related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes, as well as expanding support functions. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was approximately 4% of current period operating revenues for each of the past three years. The increase in depreciation and amortization from $75 million in 2003 to $87 million in 2004 was principally due to new center developments and acquisitions. Provision for uncollectible accounts. The provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately 2% of current period operating revenues for each of the three years. During 2002, we realized recoveries of $5 million associated with aged accounts receivable that had been reserved in 1999. The recoveries resulted from improvements made in our billing and collection processes. Minority interests and equity income, net. Minority interests net of equity income increased in 2004 by approximately $7 million due to an increase in new centers having minority partners as well as growth in the earnings of our joint ventures. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, and investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. Other income Other income, which was a net of approximately $4 million, $3 million and $4 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, consisted principally of interest income. Debt expense and refinancing charges Debt expense for 2004, 2003 and 2002 consisted of interest expense of approximately $50 million, $64 million and $69 million, respectively, and amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $2 million 27 Table of Contents in 2004, and $3 million in 2003 and 2002. The decrease in interest expense in 2004 as compared to 2003 was due to changes in the mix of our debt instruments. For most of 2003 we incurred higher interest rates on our senior subordinated notes, which were paid off in the second half of 2003 and replaced with lower interest rate borrowings from our credit facility. This decrease was partially offset by the effect on interest rates from our swap agreements and higher average debt balances. The reduction in interest expense in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to lower average interest rates and lower average debt balances. Reclassification of previously reported extraordinary losses. In accordance with SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 14, and Technical Corrections, which became effective as of January 1, 2003, an after tax loss of $29.4 million in 2002 associated with the extinguishment of debt was reclassified from an extraordinary item to a pre tax refinancing charge of $49 million. In 2003, the refinancing charges of $27 million related to the consideration paid in excess of book value to redeem our Convertible Subordinated Notes and the write off of deferred financing costs and financing fees associated with the amendment of our bank credit agreement. In 2002, the refinancing charges of $49 million related to debt restructuring, which included retiring $225 million of 9 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and extinguishing our then existing senior credit facilities. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2004 represented an effective tax rate of 38.6%, compared with 39.0% and 41.0% in 2003 and 2002. The reduction in the effective tax rate for 2004 was primarily due to lower state income taxes. The reduction in the effective tax rate for 2003 was primarily due to a lower provision for state income taxes and utilization of previously unrecognized tax losses. The effective tax rate for 2005 is currently projected to be comparable to the 2004 level. Liquidity and capital resources Cash flow from operations during 2004 amounted to $420 million, including after tax Medicare lab recoveries of $17 million, compared with $294 million for 2003. Non operating cash outflows in 2004 included $128 million for capital asset expenditures including $83 million for new center developments, $265 million for acquisitions (net of divestitures), and $97 million for stock repurchases. Non operating cash outflows for 2003 included $100 million for capital asset expenditures including $58 million for new center developments, $97 million for acquisitions, and $107 million for stock repurchases. During 2004, we acquired a total of 51 dialysis centers and opened 44 new dialysis centers. During 2003 we acquired 27 dialysis centers for $84 million (including controlling ownership interests in two centers in which we previously had minority ownership) and opened 30 new dialysis centers. Other 2003 acquisitions related to ancillary operations. The largest acquisition during 2004 was the purchase of common stock of Physicians Dialysis, Inc. (PDI), for approximately $150 million, which added 24 centers. On December 6, 2004 we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Gambro Healthcare, Inc. for a purchase price of approximately $3.05 billion in cash. The timing of the closing of the acquisition transaction is dependent on the governments Hart Scott Rodino anti trust review process. In connection with the Gambro acquisition we will be assessing financing alternatives, which could include closing some or all of the financing in advance of the closing of the acquisition. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We have obtained acquisition financing commitments from a group of financial institutions, however such commitments are subject to customary conditions. We expect to spend approximately $100 million to $120 million for capital asset expenditures in 2005. This includes approximately $50 to $60 million for routine maintenance items and $50 to $60 million for new center developments. This level of capital asset expenditures is consistent with our 2004 level. We expect to open between 30 to 40 new centers in 2005. 28 Table of Contents The accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2004 and 2003 represented approximately 70 and 69 days of net revenue, net of bad debt provision. As of December 31, 2004, we had undrawn credit facilities totaling $116 million of which $23 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient borrowing capacity and operating cash flows to fund our planned acquisitions and expansions and to meet our other obligations over the next twelve months. 2004 capital structure changes. In the third quarter of 2004, we amended our existing credit facilities in order to modify certain restricted payment covenants principally for acquisitions and share repurchases and we extended the maturity of the Term Loan B until June 30, 2010. We also borrowed an additional $250 million under a new Term Loan C principally to fund potential acquisitions and share repurchases. The Term Loan C bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% for an overall effective rate of 4.16% at December 31, 2004. The aggregate annual principal payments for the amended Term Loan B and the Term Loan C are approximately $56.1 million and $11.9 million in the first five years of the agreement, and $974.2 million and $238.1 million in the sixth year, respectively. We expect to put new credit facilities in place in connection with the planned Gambro Healthcare acquisition. Under the previously announced Board authorization for share repurchases, we repurchased a total of 3,350,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $28.82 per share during 2004. On November 2, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $200 million of our common stock, from time to time, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The total outstanding Board authorizations for share repurchases are now approximately $249 million. In the first quarter of 2004, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate of 3.08%, plus the Term Loan B margin of 2.00%, for an overall effective rate of 5.08% as of December 31, 2004. The total amortizing notional amount of the swap was $135 million matched with the Term Loan B outstanding debt. The agreement expires in January 2009 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2004, the notional amount of this swap was $135 million and its fair value was an asset of $1.7 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $1.1 million, net of tax. In the third quarter of 2004, we entered into another interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate of 3.64%, plus the Term Loan C margin of 1.75%, for an overall effective rate of 5.39% as of December 31, 2004. The total $75 million non amortizing notional amount of the swap was matched with the Term Loan C outstanding debt. The agreement expires in August 2008 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2004 the fair value of the swap was an asset of $0.1 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $0.06 million, net of tax. At December 31, 2004, approximately 25% of our outstanding variable rate debt was economically fixed at an effective weighted average interest rate of 5.27% and our overall credit facility effective weighted average interest rate was 4.60% based upon current margins in effect ranging from 1.75% to 2.00%. On December 10, 2004 we entered into two forward interest rate swap agreements that will have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate at 3.875% effective July 1, 2005. The total amortizing notional amount of these two swaps is $800 million and both expire in January 2010 and require quarterly interest payments beginning in October 2005. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate notional amount of these swaps was $800 million and their fair value was an asset of $0.4 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $0.2 million, net of tax. As a result of our swap agreements, we will have over 80% of our outstanding variable rate debt economically fixed. 29 Table of Contents 2003 capital structure changes. In the first quarter of 2003, we borrowed $150 million that was available under the Term Loan A of our credit facility. The Term Loan A bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00% for an overall effective rate of 3.19% at December 31, 2003. In July 2003, we completed a call for redemption of all of our outstanding $125 million 5 5/8% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 by issuing 7,302,528 shares of our common stock from treasury stock for the conversion of nearly all the 5 5/8% Notes, and redeemed the balance for cash and accrued interest. In July 2003, we also entered into an amended credit agreement in order to, among other things, lower the overall interest rate. We also acquired an additional $200 million of borrowings under the replacement Term Loan B, which amounted to $1.042 billion. In November 2003, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement in order to again lower the interest rate on the Term Loan B and to modify certain covenants. In 2003 we completed a call for redemption of our $345 million, 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009. The 7% notes were redeemed for $363 million in cash, including accrued interest and 24,045 shares of common stock. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate of 3.39%, plus the Term Loan B margin of 2.00% for an overall effective rate of 5.39% as of December 31, 2004. The total amortizing notional amount of this swap was $135 million and was matched with Term Loan B outstanding debt. The agreement expires in November 2008 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2004, the notional amount of this swap was approximately $135 million and its fair value was an asset of $0.6 million which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $1.3 million, net of tax. During 2003, we repurchased a total of 5,162,850 shares of our common stock for approximately $107 million, or an average of $20.76 per share, pursuant to authorizations by the Board of Directors. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Nearly all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers, in the form of put options exercisable at the third party owners discretion. These put obligations, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital as needed to several third party centers including minority owned centers and centers that we operate under administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2004 (in millions): WithinOne Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 52 $ 80 $ 629 $ 607 $ 1,368 Capital lease obligations 1 4 1 2 8 Operating leases 74 132 102 189 497 $ 127 $ 216 $ 732 $ 798 $ 1,873 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 23 $ 23 Acquisition of dialysis centers 56 15 19 13 103 Working capital advances to third parties under administrative services agreements 15 15 $ 94 $ 15 $ 19 $ 13 $ 141 30 Table of Contents Contingencies Our revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements; and (5) claims for refunds from private payors. On October 25, 2004, we received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office, or U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. The subpoena covers the period from 1996 to present and requires the production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including our laboratory services. The subpoena also includes specific requests for documents relating to testing for parathyroid hormone levels, or PTH, and to products relating to vitamin D therapies. We believe that the subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena, including Fresenius Medical Care, Renal Care Group and Gambro Healthcare. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Compliance with the subpoena will require management attention and legal expense. We cannot predict whether legal proceedings will be initiated against us relating to this investigation or, if proceedings are initiated, the outcome of any such proceedings. In addition, criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. If a court determines that there has been wrongdoing, the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial. In February 2001 the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and financial relationships with physicians. We cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the U.S. Attorneys Office. In May 2002, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office and the Philadelphia Office of the OIG. The subpoena requires an update to the information we provided in our response to the February 2001 request, and also seeks a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services, as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The subpoena covers the period from May 1996 to May 2002. We have provided the documents requested and continue to cooperate with the United States Attorneys Office and the OIG in its investigation. If this review proceeds, the government could expand its areas of concern. If a court determines that there has been wrongdoing, the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these additional pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts, impairments and valuation adjustments, and accounting for income taxes, are considered 31 Table of Contents to be critical in evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize for a reporting period. The rates at which we are reimbursed are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the more than 1,500 commercial healthcare plans under which we receive reimbursements, often arbitrary and inconsistent reimbursements by commercial payors, ongoing insurance coverage changes, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on a) the reimbursement rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the reimbursement rates paid by the government payor (eg. 80% for Medicare patients) and b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (eg. Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for reimbursements, and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 50,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. Our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk is generally expected to be within 1% of total revenue, which can represent as much as 5% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses. For example, we recognized $22 million of prior period dialysis revenue in 2001 related to cash recoveries in excess of previous estimates made possible by improvements in our billing and collecting operations. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received after considering possible retroactive adjustments that may be made as a result of the ongoing third party carrier review. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as applicable. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset 32 Table of Contents will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, awards and benefit plan contributions, are updated periodically due to changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results may vary due to the subjective nature of fulfilling employee specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Significant new accounting standard for 2005 In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 123R, Share Based Payment, that amends FASB Statements No. 123 and 95, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. This statement requires a company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, such as stock options, based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize such cost over the requisite period during which an employee provides service. The grant date fair value will be determined using option pricing models adjusted for unique characteristics of the equity instruments. The statement also addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the Companys equity instruments or that may be settled through the issuance of such equity instruments. The statement does not change the accounting for transactions in which a company issues equity instruments for services to non employees or the accounting for employee stock ownership plans. This statement is effective beginning in the third quarter of 2005, and requires us to recognize compensation costs on outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. We currently project that the adoption of this standard will reduce pre tax income by less than $10 million for the second half of 2005. 33 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including the risks discussed below. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements under the heading Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. If the average rates that private payors pay us decline, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced. Approximately 40% of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have private payors as the primary payor. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us on terms and at rates materially higher than Medicare rates. Based on our recent experience in negotiating with private payors, we believe that pressure from private payors to decrease the rates they pay us may increase. If the average rates that private payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. If the number of patients with higher paying commercial insurance declines, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced. Our revenue levels are sensitive to the percentage of our reimbursements from higher paying commercial plans. A patients insurance coverage may change for a number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the patients or a family members employment status. For a patient covered by an employer group health plan, Medicare generally becomes the primary payor after 33 months, or earlier if the patients employer group health plan coverage terminates. When Medicare becomes the primary payor, the payment rate we receive for that patient shifts from the employer group health plan rate to the Medicare reimbursement rate. If there is a significant reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans relative to government based programs that pay at lower rates it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Future declines, or the lack of further increases, in Medicare reimbursement rates would reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Approximately one half of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have Medicare as their primary payor. The Medicare ESRD program reimburses us for dialysis and ancillary services at fixed rates. Unlike most other Medicare programs, the Medicare ESRD program does not provide for periodic inflation increases in reimbursement rates. Increases of 1.2% in 2000 and 2.4% in 2001 were the first increases in the composite reimbursement rate since 1991, and were significantly less than the cumulative rate of inflation over the same period. For 2002 through 2004, there was no increase in the composite reimbursement rate. Effective January 1, 2005, there was an increase of only 1.6%. Increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, have occurred and are expected to continue to occur regardless of whether there is a compensating increase in reimbursement rates. We cannot predict with certainty the nature or extent of future rate changes, if any. To the extent these rates decline or are not adjusted to keep pace with inflation, our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be adversely affected. Changes in the structure of, and reimbursement rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. The Medicare composite reimbursement rate covers the cost of treatment, including the supplies used in those treatments, specified laboratory tests and certain pharmaceuticals. Other services and pharmaceuticals, including EPO, vitamin D analogs and iron supplements, are separately billed. Changes to the structure of the composite rate and separately billable reimbursement rates became effective on January 1, 2005. These changes 34 Table of Contents more than offset the 1.6% composite rate increase that also became effective January 1, 2005. In addition, effective April 1, 2005, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, plans to implement a case mix adjustment payment methodology which is designed to pay differential composite service rates based on a variety of patient characteristics. If the case mix adjustment is not properly implemented it could adversely affect the Medicare reimbursement rates. Future changes in the structure of, and reimbursement rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. CMS continues to study the ESRD reimbursement system through a number of demonstration projects which will take place over the next few years. The changes that went into effect on January 1, 2005 include changes in the way we are reimbursed for certain pharmaceuticals that are currently billed outside the composite rate. Pharmaceuticals are approximately one half of our total Medicare revenues. If Medicare begins to include in its composite reimbursement rate pharmaceuticals, laboratory services or other ancillary services that it currently reimburses separately, or if there are further changes to or decreases in the reimbursement rate for these items without a corresponding increase in the composite rate, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Changes in state Medicaid programs or reimbursement rates could reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. More than 5% of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have Medicaid as their primary coverage. State governments may propose reductions in reimbursement rates, limitations on eligibility or other changes to Medicaid programs from time to time. If state governments reduce the rates paid by those programs for dialysis and related services, limit eligibility for Medicaid coverage or adopt changes similar to those adopted by Medicare, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected. Changes in clinical practices and reimbursement rates or rules for EPO and other pharmaceuticals could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. The administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals accounts for approximately 40% of our total dialysis revenues. Changes in physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices, changes in private and governmental reimbursement criteria, the introduction of new pharmaceuticals and the conversion to alternate types of administration could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. For example, some Medicare fiscal intermediaries (Medicare claims processing contractors) are seeking to implement local medical review policies for EPO and vitamin D analogs that would effectively limit utilization of and reimbursement for these pharmaceuticals. CMS has proposed a draft reimbursement policy that would direct all fiscal intermediaries with respect to reimbursement coverage for EPO. It is possible that the draft policy, if finalized, will affect physician prescription patterns and the timing of our cash flows due to changes in auditing methodology by fiscal intermediaries. Adverse developments with respect to EPO and the introduction of Aranesp&reg; could materially reduce our earnings and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients. Amgen is the sole supplier of EPO and may unilaterally decide to increase its price for EPO at any time. For example, Amgen unilaterally increased its base price for EPO by 3.9% in each of 2002, 2001 and 2000. Although we have entered into contracts for EPO pricing for a fixed time period that includes discount variables depending on certain clinical criteria and other criteria, we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the discount structure for EPO that we currently receive, or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of discounts within that structure as we have historically achieved. An increase in the cost of EPO could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows. Amgen has developed and obtained FDA approval for Aranesp&reg;, a new pharmaceutical used to treat anemia that may replace EPO or reduce its use with dialysis patients. Unlike EPO, which is generally administered in 35 Table of Contents conjunction with each dialysis treatment, Aranesp&reg; can remain effective for between two and three weeks. In the event that Amgen begins to market Aranesp&reg; for the treatment of dialysis patients, we may realize lower margins on the administration of Aranesp&reg; than are currently realized with EPO. In addition, some physicians may begin to administer Aranesp&reg; in their offices, which would prevent us from recognizing revenue or profit from the administration of EPO or Aranesp&reg; to those physicians patients. A significant increase in the use of Aranesp&reg; would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. The investigation related to the subpoena we received on October 25, 2004 from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York could result in substantial penalties against us. We are voluntarily cooperating with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and the OIG with respect to the subpoena we received on October 25, 2004, which requested a wide range of documents, including specific documents relating to testing of parathyroid hormone levels and products relating to vitamin D therapies. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena including Gambro Healthcare, Fresenius Medical Care and Renal Care Group. The U.S. Attorneys Office has also requested information regarding our Florida laboratory. Compliance with the subpoena will require management attention and legal expense. We are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved, whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters, financial or otherwise. In addition, criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. The pending federal review related to the subpoena we received in May 2002 from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania could result in substantial penalties against us. We are voluntarily cooperating with the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the OIG in a review of some historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures, financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies, and the provision of pharmaceutical and other ancillary services, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services. The U.S. Attorneys Office has also requested and received information regarding certain of our laboratories. We are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved, whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters, financial or otherwise. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations, federal and state anti kickback laws, Stark II physician self referral prohibition and analogous state referral statutes, and federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information. The regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers, including dialysis providers, has increased significantly in recent years. Medicare has increased the frequency and intensity of its certification surveys and inspections of dialysis centers have increased markedly in recent years. In addition, fiscal intermediaries are increasing their prepayment and post payment reviews. We endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with the anti kickback laws and the Stark II physicians self referral law. However, the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations. For example, none of our medical director agreements establishes compensation using the anti kickback safe harbor method; rather, compensation under our medical director agreements is the result of individual negotiation and the Company believes exceeds amounts determined in that manner. If an enforcement agency were to challenge the level of compensation that we pay our medical directors, we could be required to 36 Table of Contents change our practices, face criminal or civil penalties, pay substantial fines or otherwise experience a material adverse effect as a result of a challenge to these arrangements. Due to regulatory considerations unique to each of these states, all of our dialysis operations in New York and some of our dialysis operations in New Jersey are conducted by privately owned companies to which we provide a broad range of administrative services. These operations account for approximately 6% of our dialysis revenues. We believe that we have structured these operations to comply with the laws and regulations of these states, but we can give no assurances that they will not be challenged. If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows including: Mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses; Suspension or termination of our participation in government reimbursement programs; Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable reimbursement program requirements; Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government reimbursement programs; Loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate, including the loss of revenues from operations in New York and New Jersey conducted by privately owned companies as described above; Fines, damages or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations, Stark II violations, submission of false claims, civil or criminal liability based on violations of law, or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements and patient privacy law violations; Claims for monetary damages from patients who believe their protected health information has been used or disclosed in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws; and Termination of relationships with medical directors. We may be subject to liability claims for damages and other expenses not covered by insurance that could reduce our earnings and cash flows. The administration of dialysis and related services to patients may subject us to litigation and liability for damages. Our business, profitability and growth prospects could suffer if we face negative publicity or we pay damages or defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope of any applicable insurance coverage. We currently maintain programs of general and professional liability insurance. However, a successful professional liability, malpractice or negligence claim in excess of our insurance coverage could harm our profitability and liquidity. In addition, if our costs of insurance and claims increase, then our earnings could decline. Market rates for insurance premiums and deductibles have been steadily increasing. Our earnings and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following: Further increases in premiums and deductibles; Increases in the number of liability claims against us or the cost of settling or trying cases related to those claims; and An inability to obtain one or more types of insurance on acceptable terms. If businesses we acquire have unknown liabilities, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Our business strategy includes the acquisition of dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate dialysis centers. Businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities or liabilities that are in excess of the amounts that we had estimated. These liabilities could include liabilities arising as a result of any failure to adhere to laws and regulations governing dialysis operations, such as violations of federal or state anti kickback statutes or Stark II. Although we generally seek indemnification from the sellers of businesses we acquire for 37 Table of Contents matters that are not properly disclosed to us, we are not always successful. In addition, even in cases where we are able to obtain indemnification, we may discover liabilities greater than the contractual limits or the financial resources of the indemnifying party. In the event that we are responsible for liabilities substantially in excess of any amounts recovered through rights to indemnification, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced. Many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at dialysis centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical directors of the centers. As a result, the primary referral source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center. If a medical director agreement terminates, whether before or at the end of its term, and a new medical director is appointed, it may negatively impact the former medical directors decision to treat his or her patients at our center. Additionally, both current and former medical directors have no obligation to refer their patients to our centers. Also, if the quality of service levels at our centers deteriorate, it may negatively impact patient referrals and treatment volumes. Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally five to ten years. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us. As of January 1, 2005, there were 59 centers, accounting for approximately 9% of our 2004 treatment volume, at which the medical director agreements require renewal on or before December 31, 2005. We may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships to assure compliance with the safe harbor provisions of the anti kickback statute, Stark II law and other similar laws. These actions could negatively impact the decision of physicians to extend their medical director agreements with us or to refer their patients to us. If the terms of any existing agreement are found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship which could lead to the early termination of the agreement, or force the physician to stop referring patients to the centers. If our joint ventures were found to violate the law, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. As of December 31, 2004 we operated 128 dialysis centers, representing approximately 15% of our dialysis revenue, that are owned by joint ventures in which we own a controlling interest and one or more physicians or physician practice groups have a minority interest. The physician owners may also provide medical director services to those centers or other centers we own and operate. Because our relationships with physicians are governed by the anti kickback statute contained in the Social Security Act, we have sought to structure our joint venture arrangements to satisfy as many safe harbor requirements as possible. However, our joint venture arrangements do not satisfy all elements of any safe harbor under the federal anti kickback statute. Based on the exceptions applicable to ESRD services, we believe that our joint venture arrangements and operations materially comply with the Stark II law. If the joint ventures are found to be in violation of the anti kickback statute or the Stark provisions, we could be required to restructure the joint ventures or refuse to accept referrals for designated health services from the physicians with whom the joint venture centers have a financial relationship. We also could be required to repay to Medicare amounts received by the joint ventures pursuant to prohibited referrals, and we could be subject to monetary penalties and exclusion from government healthcare programs. If our joint venture centers are subject to any of these penalties, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. 38 Table of Contents The level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business. We have substantial debt outstanding and if we consummate the proposed Gambro Healthcare acquisition we will incur substantial additional debt. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The level of our current and proposed indebtedness, among other things, could: make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt securities; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes; expose us to interest rate fluctuations because the interest on the debt under some of our indebtedness may be at variable rates; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. If additional debt financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to grow our business, take advantage of business opportunities, respond to competitive pressures or refinance maturing debt, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. We will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts, including any strategic acquisitions we may make in the future, will depend on our ability to generate cash. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that our currently anticipated growth in revenue and cash flow will be realized on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Our senior secured credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets. As such, our ability to refinance our debt or seek additional financing could be limited by such security interest. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel continues, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses. We are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. We compete for nurses with hospitals and other health care providers. This nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations. If we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, our operations and treatment growth will be negatively impacted, which would result in reduced revenues, earnings and cash flows. 39 Table of Contents Provisions in our charter documents, compensation programs and Delaware law may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests. Our charter documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent, requiring 90 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our Board of Directors and granting our Board of Directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval, and a poison pill that would substantially dilute the interest sought by an acquirer that our Board of Directors does not approve. In addition, most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control. We have also adopted a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock awards, which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. Based on the shares of our common stock outstanding and the market price of our stock on December 31, 2004, these cash bonuses would total approximately $149 million if a control transaction occurred at that price and our Board of Directors did not modify the program. These compensation programs may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law that, subject to exceptions, would prohibit us from engaging in any business combinations with any interested stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder. These restrictions may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of our Company. These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our Company at a price that our stockholders may find attractive. These provisions could also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. The Gambro Healthcare acquisition is significantly larger than any other acquisition we have made to date. We will face challenges integrating the Gambro Healthcare centers and may not realize anticipated benefits. The Gambro Healthcare acquisition is the largest acquisition we have attempted to date. There is a risk that, due to the size of the acquisition, we will be unable to integrate Gambro Healthcare into our operations as effectively as we have with prior acquisitions, which would result in fewer benefits to us from the acquisition than currently anticipated as well as increased costs. The integration of the Gambro Healthcare operations will require implementation of appropriate operations, management and financial reporting systems and controls. We may experience difficulties in effectively implementing these and other systems and integrating Gambro Healthcares systems and operations. In addition, the integration of Gambro Healthcare will require the focused attention of our management team, including a significant commitment of their time and resources. The need for management to focus on integration matters, could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues and operating results. If the integration is not successful or if our Gambro Healthcare operations are less profitable than we currently anticipate, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. We will assume substantially all of Gambro Healthcares liabilities, including contingent liabilities. If these liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are unknown Gambro Healthcare obligations, our business could be materially and adversely affected. As a result of the Gambro Healthcare acquisition, we will assume substantially all of Gambro Healthcares liabilities, including contingent liabilities. We may learn additional information about Gambro Healthcares 40 Table of Contents business that adversely affects us, such as unknown liabilities, issues relating to internal controls over financial reporting, issues that could affect our ability to comply with the Sarbanes Oxley Act after we acquire Gambro Healthcare or issues that could affect our ability to comply with other applicable laws, including laws and regulations governing dialysis operations. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Gambro Healthcare acquisition will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. Among other things, if Gambro Healthcares liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are obligations of Gambro Healthcare of which we are not aware at the time of completion of the acquisition, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We have limited indemnification rights in connection with these and other regulatory compliance and litigation matters affecting Gambro Healthcare, as well as known contingent liabilities of Gambro Healthcare that we will assume. For example, Gambro Healthcare was served a complaint regarding a former employee and a putative class of employees in California for claims relating to California labor laws. Although this matter is subject to indemnification under the acquisition agreement, claims relating to this matter may exceed the limit on our indemnification rights. Gambro Healthcare may also have other unknown liabilities which we will be responsible for after the acquisition. If we are responsible for liabilities not covered by indemnification rights or substantially in excess of amounts covered through any indemnification rights, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. The integration of Gambro Healthcare and the realization of cost savings will require us to make significant expenditures. In order to obtain the cost savings and operating income that we believe the integration of Gambro Healthcare should provide, we will be required to make significant expenditures. We are in the early stages of planning for the integration process and are uncertain as to the extent and amount of these expenditures. Further, given the amount of indebtedness that we will incur as part of the Gambro Healthcare acquisition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing required for any significant expenditures on favorable terms or at all. In addition, we may not achieve the cost savings we expect through the integration of the Gambro Healthcare operations regardless of our expenditures, which failure would materially and adversely affect our financial results. The costs associated with compliance with the corporate integrity agreement could be substantial and may be greater than we currently anticipate. If we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for Gambro Healthcare employees after the acquisition, we may not be able to effectively integrate their operations. In order to successfully integrate the Gambro Healthcare operations into our own, we will require the services of Gambro Healthcares clinical, operating and administrative employees. If we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for Gambro Healthcare employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate Gambro Healthcares systems and operations. If we lose the services of a significant number of Gambro Healthcares medical directors, our results of operations could be harmed. Certain of Gambro Healthcares contracts with its medical directors provide that the contract is terminable upon a change of control of Gambro Healthcare. These termination provisions would be triggered by our acquisition of Gambro Healthcare. If we lose the services of a significant number of Gambro Healthcares medical directors, our results of operations may be harmed. Our alliance and product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products Inc. will limit our ability to achieve costs savings with respect to products and equipment we are required to purchase under this agreement. In connection with the Gambro Healthcare acquisition, we will enter into a ten year alliance and product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products Inc., a subsidiary of Gambro AB, pursuant to which we will be 41 Table of Contents required to purchase from Gambro Renal Products specified percentages of our requirements for hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices. This will limit our ability to realize future cost savings in regard to these products and equipment. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, our total spending on hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment was approximately 8% of our total operating costs. If Gambro Renal Products is unable to fulfill its obligations under the agreement, we may have difficulty finding alternative sources of supplies on favorable financial terms, further reducing our ability to achieve cost savings. In addition, as we replace existing equipment from other third party manufacturers with Gambro Renal Products equipment, we may incur additional expenses as we transition to this new equipment. The consummation of the Gambro Healthcare acquisition is subject to a number of conditions; if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, we will not be able to consummate the acquisition. The stock purchase agreement relating to the Gambro Healthcare acquisition contains a number of conditions which must be satisfied or waived prior to the closing of the acquisition. These conditions include, among others, execution and delivery of the transition services agreement and the alliance product and supply agreement and receipt of regulatory approvals, including antitrust clearance. On February 18, 2005, we received a request from the Federal Trade Commission for additional information in connection with its review of our anti trust filing. We intend to respond promptly to this request. The effect of the second request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the Hart Scott Rodino Act until thirty days after we and Gambro Healthcare have substantially complied with the request, unless that period is extended voluntarily by us and Gambro Healthcare or is terminated sooner by the FTC. In addition, one or more states Attorneys General could attempt to impose conditions or otherwise interfere with the proposed acquisition. In connection with obtaining antitrust clearance, we may decide to, or the Federal Trade Commission or other regulatory agencies with jurisdiction may request that we divest certain of our or Gambro Healthcares dialysis centers. These divestitures could be material. In addition, we will require financing in order to consummate the Gambro Healthcare acquisition. We have obtained acquisition financing commitments from a group of financial institutions, however such commitments are subject to customary conditions. We therefore cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all or that we will be able to consummate the Gambro Healthcare acquisition on the terms described herein or at all. If we do not cause Gambro Healthcare to comply and Gambro Healthcare does not comply with its corporate integrity agreement, or Gambro Healthcare otherwise has failed or fails to comply with applicable government regulations to its operations, we could be subject to additional penalties and otherwise may be materially harmed. On December 1, 2004, Gambro Healthcare entered into a settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States government relating to the Department of Justices investigation of Gambro Healthcares Medicare and Medicaid billing practices and its relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers. In connection with the settlement agreement, Gambro Healthcare, without admitting liability, made a one time payment of approximately $310 million and entered into a corporate integrity agreement with HHS. In addition, its subsidiary, Gambro Supply Corp., entered a plea of guilty to a one count felony charge related to the conduct of its predecessor, REN Supply Corp., and paid a criminal fine of $25 million. Gambro Supply Corp. was excluded from participation in federal health care programs. However, no other Gambro AB affiliates were so excluded. Gambro Healthcare also agreed to voluntarily cooperate with the government in connection with its further investigation. The corporate integrity agreement applies to all of Gambro Healthcares centers and requires, among other things, that Gambro Healthcare implement additional training, engage an independent review organization to conduct an annual review of certain of its reimbursement claims, and submit to the OIG an annual report with respect to its compliance activities. Moreover, Gambro Healthcare has reached a preliminary understanding with the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units to settle the related claims of the affected state Medicaid programs for a one time payment of $15 million plus interest accruing at the rate of 5% per annum from December 1, 2004. Completion of the Medicaid settlement is subject to confirmation of certain claims data and negotiation and execution of settlement 42 Table of Contents agreements with the relevant states. As a result of the settlement agreement, private payors and other third parties may initiate legal proceedings against Gambro Healthcare related to the billing practices and other matters covered by the settlement agreement. If we do not cause Gambro Healthcare to comply, and Gambro Healthcare does not comply, with the terms of the corporate integrity agreement or otherwise has failed or fails to comply with the extensive federal, state and local government regulations applicable to its operations, we could be subject to additional penalties, including monetary penalties or suspension from participation in government reimbursement programs, and otherwise may be materially harmed. The costs associated with compliance with the corporate integrity agreement and cooperation with the government could be substantial and may be greater than we currently anticipate. 43 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2004. For our debt obligations with variable interest rates, the rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of 2004 including the economic effects of our swap agreements. These rates are based on LIBOR plus margins based upon performance and leverage criteria plus the impact from the swap agreements. The margins currently in effect range from 1.75% to 2.00%. Expected maturity date Total Fair Value Average interest rate 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 5 $ 1 $ 3 $ 3 $ 13 $ 13 5.53 % Variable rate $ 48 $ 55 $ 25 $ 15 $ 614 $ 606 $ 1,363 $ 1,363 4.63 % Our senior credit facility is based on a floating LIBOR interest rate plus a margin, which is reset periodically and can be locked in for a maximum of six months. As a result, our interest expense is subject to fluctuations as LIBOR interest rates change. We have entered into three interest rate swap agreements, two matched on our Term Loan B outstanding debt and one matched on our Term Loan C outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2004, the total notional amount of these swap agreements was $345 million and the interest rates were economically modified to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 3.64% plus the Term Loan margins ranging from 1.75% to 2.00%, in effect as of December 31, 2004. This resulted in an overall effective rate of 5.27% as of December 31, 2004, on approximately 25% of our outstanding debt. Two of the swap agreements expire in 2008 and one in 2009. As of December 31, 2004, the fair value of the swaps was an asset of $2.4 million. As a result of these swap agreements, our overall effective weighted average interest rate of our credit facility was 4.60% based upon current margins in effect ranging from 1.75% to 2.00% as of December 31, 2004. We also have entered into two forward interest rate swap agreements that will have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to become a fixed rate at 3.875% effective July 1, 2005. The total amortizing notional amount of the two swaps is $800 million and both expire in January 2010 and require quarterly interest payments beginning in October 2005. As of December 31, 2004, the fair value of these swaps was an asset of $0.4 million. As a result of all of our swap agreements, we will have over 80% of our outstanding variable rate debt economically fixed. One means of assessing exposure to interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $5.9 million, $6.5 million and $3.5 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk. 44 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Annual report on Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements that do not concern historical facts are forward looking statements and include among other things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, and capital expenditures. These statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements, including, but not limited to, risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, and the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients, possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, and legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the ongoing review by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and the OIG and the subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and our ability to complete acquisitions of businesses, including the consummation of the Gambro Healthcare acquisition, terms of the related financing, and subsequent integration of the business. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, other than in connection with our quarterly reporting on Form 10 Q or in our Annual Report on Form 10 K, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview Our stated mission is to be the provider, employer and partner of choice. We believe our attention to these three areas our patients, our teammates, and our business partners represent the major drivers of our long term success, aside from external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes have improved over each of the past three years, and we ended 2004 with the best clinical outcomes that we have ever achieved. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. Over the past three years we have achieved significant reductions in teammate turnover, which has been a major contributor to our performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. We are pleased with the overall clinical, operating and financial performance levels achieved over the past three years. Although our business has areas of significant potential exposure, as delineated in the risk factors following this discussion and analysis, our operating results over the past three years have not been significantly adversely affected by these risk factors. Our operations represent a single reporting segment, with approximately 96% of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis services, of which 88% represents on site dialysis services in 624 centers that are wholly owned or majority owned. Our other direct dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our center operations, relate to patient performed peritoneal dialysis and acute treatments in hospitals. 22 Table of Contents The principal drivers of our revenue are a) the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week, and b) average treatment revenue. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our pace of opening and acquiring new centers. Our year over year treatment volume growth for 2004 was 10.8%, compared with 6.7% and 5.0% for 2003 and 2002. Approximately 40% of our growth in each of the last two years was associated with new centers, and approximately 60% was attributable to increased treatments. Average revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) treatments, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government reimbursement rates, and our dialysis services charge capture, billing and collecting operations performance. On average, reimbursement rates from commercial payors are more than double Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment. The percent of patients under government reimbursement programs to total dialysis center patients increased approximately 1% over the past two years, and is currently approximately 79%. In terms of revenue dollars, approximately 60% of our total dialysis revenue is from government or government based programs. Government reimbursement rates are principally determined by federal (Medicare) and state (Medicaid) policy, have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reductions. Medicare reimbursements represent approximately 50% of our dialysis revenue, and cumulative increases since 1990 total approximately 5%. There were no Medicare reimbursement rate increases for 2003 and 2004. A 1.6% increase became effective on January 1, 2005, however this increase will be more than offset by other structural changes to Medicare dialysis reimbursement rates that also became effective January 1, 2005. Medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures. Approximately 40% of our dialysis revenue is from commercial healthcare plans and contracted managed care payors. Commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Over the past three years we have been successful in maintaining a relatively stable average reimbursement rate in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases. Approximately 40% of our dialysis revenue has been associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, and therefore changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, and pharmaceutical intensities significantly influence our revenue levels. Such changes, driven by physician practice patterns and protocols focused on improving clinical outcomes, have accounted for a significant portion of the increase in average revenue per treatment over the past three years. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services charge capture, billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average revenue per treatment is actually realized. Over the past three years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that have helped improve our operating performance and reduce our regulatory compliance risks. Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with predicting third party reimbursements in the healthcare industry, our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. 23 Table of Contents Our annual average revenue per treatment increased from $291 in 2002 to $303 in 2003 and to $312 in 2004. These increases were principally due to increases in our standard fee schedules (impacting non contracted commercial revenue), changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial contract negotiations, and continued improvements in revenue capture, billing and collection operations, while maintaining a relatively stable mix of commercial patients and commercial rates. The principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost changes such as increased insurance costs experienced in 2003. Our average clinical hours per treatment has improved over the past three years primarily because of reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in 2004, and federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. Labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends. For the past three years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors, and expect relatively stable pricing through 2005. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenue over the past three years. However, this reflects substantial increases in spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes, legal and other professional fees, and expanding support functions. We expect that these higher levels of general and administrative expenses will be generally maintained to support our long term initiatives and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Although other revenues represent less than 5% of total revenues, successful resolutions of disputed Medicare billings at our Florida lab resulted in recoveries related to prior years services being recognized as current period revenue and operating income of $8 million, $24 million, and $59 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The carrier began making payments on Medicare lab billings in the third quarter of 2002 after four years of withholding all payments. Therefore we were able to begin recognizing Medicare lab revenue as services were provided, incrementally increasing income by such revenue. Medicare lab revenues for 2004 current year services amounted to $34 million. Gambro Healthcare Acquisition. On December 6, 2004, we entered into an agreement to acquire Gambro Healthcare, Inc., or Gambro Healthcare, a subsidiary of Gambro AB, one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, for a purchase price of approximately $3.05 billion in cash. We currently plan to finance this transaction and refinance our existing credit facility through the issuance of notes and the entry into a new senior secured credit facility. In conjunction with the acquisition, we are entering into a 10 year product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products Inc., a subsidiary of Gambro AB, to provide a significant majority of our dialysis equipment and supplies. We expect that the acquisition will increase our revenues by more than 80% based on 2004 levels. The timing of the completion of the acquisition transaction is dependent on the governments Hart Scott Rodino antitrust review process. On February 18, 2005, the Company received a request from the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, for additional information in connection with the acquisition. The request extends the waiting period imposed by the Hart Scott Rodino Act until thirty days after the Company and Gambro Healthcare have substantially complied with the request, unless that period is voluntarily extended by the parties or is terminated sooner by the FTC. In connection with obtaining antitrust clearance, we may decide to, or the FTC or other regulatory agencies with jurisdiction may require us to, divest certain of our or Gambro Healthcares dialysis centers. Outlook for 2005. We are currently targeting operating income to be between 2% and 6% higher than the 2004 level, exclusive of the effects of the Gambro Healthcare acquisition and related debt financing, and exclusive of the expensing of stock options required by FASB No. 123R. In connection with the Gambro acquisition the Company will be assessing financing alternatives, which could include closing some or all of the financing in advance of the closing of the acquisition. At this time, we expect the Gambro Healthcare acquisition together with the related debt financing to be dilutive to earnings per share, or EPS, in the first year after the 24 Table of Contents closing of the acquisition, neutral in the second year, and accretive thereafter. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients, possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies, our ability to maintain contracts with our physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the ongoing review by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the OIG and the subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York, and our ability to complete acquisitions of businesses, including the consummation of the Gambro acquisition, terms of the related financing, and subsequent integration of the businesses. You should read Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or other developments. Results of operations Following is a summary of operating results for reference in the discussion that follows: Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, except per treatment data) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 2,291 100 % $ 1,992 100 % $ 1,796 100 % Prior years services laboratory 8 24 59 2,299 2,016 1,855 Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 1,555 68 % 1,361 68 % 1,218 68 % General and administrative 192 8 % 160 8 % 154 9 % Depreciation and amortization 87 4 % 75 4 % 64 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 41 2 % 36 2 % 32 2 % Recoveries (5 ) Minority interests and equity income, net 14 7 8 Total operating expenses and charges 1,889 1,638 1,471 Operating income including prior years recoveries, (i.e., including amounts in italics) $ 410 $ 379 $ 384 Dialysis treatments 7,062,424 6,373,894 5,975,280 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 22,528 20,377 19,090 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 312 $ 303 $ 291 Net operating revenues Dialysis revenues represented approximately 96% of net operating revenues in 2004, and 97% in 2003 and 2002. Lab and other ancillary services and management fee income accounted for the balance of revenues. Operating revenues for current period services increased 15% in 2004 and 11% in 2003. Approximately 11% and 7% of the increases in revenue for 2004 and 2003 were due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments and approximately 3% and 4% was attributable to increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment. The balance of the increase in 2004 was due to additional lab, management fees and ancillary revenue. Dialysis revenues. Dialysis services include outpatient center hemodialysis, home dialysis and inpatient hemodialysis under contracts with hospitals, which accounted for approximately 88%, 7% and 5% of total 25 Table of Contents dialysis revenues, respectively. Major components of dialysis revenues include the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents approximately 40% of total dialysis revenues. Approximately 60% of our total dialysis revenues are from government based programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, with the balance from more than 600 commercial payors under more than 1500 commercial healthcare plans and approximately 300 managed care contracts. Approximately 50% of our total dialysis revenues are associated with Medicare patients, who represent nearly 70% of our total patients. Services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans are paid on average at more than double the Medicare or Medicaid rates. Patients covered by employer group health plans convert to Medicare after a maximum of 33 months. As of year end 2004, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $121 and $144 per treatment, or an overall average of $131 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. The majority of our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated reimbursement rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. The commercial reimbursement rates are under continuous downward pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the reimbursement rates normally decline substantially. No single payor accounts for more than 5% of total dialysis revenues. The number of dialysis treatments increased 10.8% in 2004 and 6.7% in 2003. Acquisitions accounted for 5.8% and 2.8% of treatment growth for 2004 and 2003. Non acquired treatment growth was 5.0% and 3.9% for 2004 and 2003. The average dialysis revenues recognized per treatment was $312, $303 and $291 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in average dialysis revenues per treatment in 2004 and 2003 was principally due to commercial rate increases and changes in intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The average dialysis revenues per treatment for the fourth quarter of 2004 was approximately $311. Our mix of commercial patients and commercial rates, which is a major profitability factor, remained relatively stable during 2004. Lab and other services. A third party carrier review of Medicare reimbursement claims associated with our Florida based laboratory was initiated in 1998. Prior to the third quarter 2002, no Medicare payments had been received since May 1998. Following a favorable ruling by an administrative law judge in June 2002 relating to review periods from January 1995 to March 1998, the carrier began releasing funds for lab services provided subsequent to May 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the carrier also released funds for certain claims in review periods from April 1998 through May 2001. During the second half of 2002, the carrier paid us a total of $69 million. Approximately $10 million of these collections related to 2002 lab services provided through June 2002, and the balance of $59 million related to prior years services. In addition to paying the prior period claims, the carrier also began processing billings for current period services in the third quarter of 2002, at which time we began recognizing current period Medicare lab revenue. In late 2003 the carriers hearing officer rendered partially favorable decisions relating to review periods from April 1998 to May 2000, resulting in our recognition of additional recoveries of $24 million. We filed requests for appeal for the remaining unsettled claims for these review periods. In the third quarter of 2004, an administrative law judge rendered a favorable decision regarding the majority of these unsettled claims, which resulted in our recognition of $8.3 million in additional recoveries. Less than $4 million in disputed Medicare lab billings currently remain unresolved. Management fee income. Management fee income represented less than 1% of net operating revenues for 2004 and 2003. We operated or provided administrative services to 34 third party or minority owned dialysis centers as of December 31, 2004. In 2003 we acquired an outpatient vascular access management business that currently manages the vascular access component at seventeen independent third party physician practices. Our management fees are principally based on a percentage of the revenue of the managed operations. 26 Table of Contents Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and facility costs. As a percentage of current period operating revenues, patient care costs were 68% for all periods presented. On a per treatment basis, patient care costs increased approximately $7 and $11 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increases in 2004 and 2003 were principally due to higher labor costs and increases in the levels of revenue generating physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The increase in 2003 was also due to higher insurance costs. The higher labor costs reflect rising labor rates and the effect of the increase in the number of newly opened centers not yet at normal productivity levels, partially offset by general labor productivity improvements. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in 2004. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and include expenses for corporate and regional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions, and regulatory compliance oversight. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of current period operating revenues were 8.4%, 8.0% and 8.6% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In absolute dollars, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $32 million in 2004 and $6 million in 2003. The increase in 2004 principally consisted of higher labor costs, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives, and increases in support infrastructure for corporate initiatives and business expansion. The increase in 2003 was principally due to higher labor costs. The substantial increases in labor costs for 2004 and 2003 principally related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes, as well as expanding support functions. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was approximately 4% of current period operating revenues for each of the past three years. The increase in depreciation and amortization from $75 million in 2003 to $87 million in 2004 was principally due to new center developments and acquisitions. Provision for uncollectible accounts. The provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately 2% of current period operating revenues for each of the three years. During 2002, we realized recoveries of $5 million associated with aged accounts receivable that had been reserved in 1999. The recoveries resulted from improvements made in our billing and collection processes. Minority interests and equity income, net. Minority interests net of equity income increased in 2004 by approximately $7 million due to an increase in new centers having minority partners as well as growth in the earnings of our joint ventures. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, and investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. Other income Other income, which was a net of approximately $4 million, $3 million and $4 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, consisted principally of interest income. Debt expense and refinancing charges Debt expense for 2004, 2003 and 2002 consisted of interest expense of approximately $50 million, $64 million and $69 million, respectively, and amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $2 million 27 Table of Contents in 2004, and $3 million in 2003 and 2002. The decrease in interest expense in 2004 as compared to 2003 was due to changes in the mix of our debt instruments. For most of 2003 we incurred higher interest rates on our senior subordinated notes, which were paid off in the second half of 2003 and replaced with lower interest rate borrowings from our credit facility. This decrease was partially offset by the effect on interest rates from our swap agreements and higher average debt balances. The reduction in interest expense in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to lower average interest rates and lower average debt balances. Reclassification of previously reported extraordinary losses. In accordance with SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 14, and Technical Corrections, which became effective as of January 1, 2003, an after tax loss of $29.4 million in 2002 associated with the extinguishment of debt was reclassified from an extraordinary item to a pre tax refinancing charge of $49 million. In 2003, the refinancing charges of $27 million related to the consideration paid in excess of book value to redeem our Convertible Subordinated Notes and the write off of deferred financing costs and financing fees associated with the amendment of our bank credit agreement. In 2002, the refinancing charges of $49 million related to debt restructuring, which included retiring $225 million of 9 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and extinguishing our then existing senior credit facilities. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2004 represented an effective tax rate of 38.6%, compared with 39.0% and 41.0% in 2003 and 2002. The reduction in the effective tax rate for 2004 was primarily due to lower state income taxes. The reduction in the effective tax rate for 2003 was primarily due to a lower provision for state income taxes and utilization of previously unrecognized tax losses. The effective tax rate for 2005 is currently projected to be comparable to the 2004 level. Liquidity and capital resources Cash flow from operations during 2004 amounted to $420 million, including after tax Medicare lab recoveries of $17 million, compared with $294 million for 2003. Non operating cash outflows in 2004 included $128 million for capital asset expenditures including $83 million for new center developments, $265 million for acquisitions (net of divestitures), and $97 million for stock repurchases. Non operating cash outflows for 2003 included $100 million for capital asset expenditures including $58 million for new center developments, $97 million for acquisitions, and $107 million for stock repurchases. During 2004, we acquired a total of 51 dialysis centers and opened 44 new dialysis centers. During 2003 we acquired 27 dialysis centers for $84 million (including controlling ownership interests in two centers in which we previously had minority ownership) and opened 30 new dialysis centers. Other 2003 acquisitions related to ancillary operations. The largest acquisition during 2004 was the purchase of common stock of Physicians Dialysis, Inc. (PDI), for approximately $150 million, which added 24 centers. On December 6, 2004 we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Gambro Healthcare, Inc. for a purchase price of approximately $3.05 billion in cash. The timing of the closing of the acquisition transaction is dependent on the governments Hart Scott Rodino anti trust review process. In connection with the Gambro acquisition we will be assessing financing alternatives, which could include closing some or all of the financing in advance of the closing of the acquisition. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We have obtained acquisition financing commitments from a group of financial institutions, however such commitments are subject to customary conditions. We expect to spend approximately $100 million to $120 million for capital asset expenditures in 2005. This includes approximately $50 to $60 million for routine maintenance items and $50 to $60 million for new center developments. This level of capital asset expenditures is consistent with our 2004 level. We expect to open between 30 to 40 new centers in 2005. 28 Table of Contents The accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2004 and 2003 represented approximately 70 and 69 days of net revenue, net of bad debt provision. As of December 31, 2004, we had undrawn credit facilities totaling $116 million of which $23 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient borrowing capacity and operating cash flows to fund our planned acquisitions and expansions and to meet our other obligations over the next twelve months. 2004 capital structure changes. In the third quarter of 2004, we amended our existing credit facilities in order to modify certain restricted payment covenants principally for acquisitions and share repurchases and we extended the maturity of the Term Loan B until June 30, 2010. We also borrowed an additional $250 million under a new Term Loan C principally to fund potential acquisitions and share repurchases. The Term Loan C bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% for an overall effective rate of 4.16% at December 31, 2004. The aggregate annual principal payments for the amended Term Loan B and the Term Loan C are approximately $56.1 million and $11.9 million in the first five years of the agreement, and $974.2 million and $238.1 million in the sixth year, respectively. We expect to put new credit facilities in place in connection with the planned Gambro Healthcare acquisition. Under the previously announced Board authorization for share repurchases, we repurchased a total of 3,350,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $28.82 per share during 2004. On November 2, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $200 million of our common stock, from time to time, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The total outstanding Board authorizations for share repurchases are now approximately $249 million. In the first quarter of 2004, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate of 3.08%, plus the Term Loan B margin of 2.00%, for an overall effective rate of 5.08% as of December 31, 2004. The total amortizing notional amount of the swap was $135 million matched with the Term Loan B outstanding debt. The agreement expires in January 2009 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2004, the notional amount of this swap was $135 million and its fair value was an asset of $1.7 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $1.1 million, net of tax. In the third quarter of 2004, we entered into another interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate of 3.64%, plus the Term Loan C margin of 1.75%, for an overall effective rate of 5.39% as of December 31, 2004. The total $75 million non amortizing notional amount of the swap was matched with the Term Loan C outstanding debt. The agreement expires in August 2008 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2004 the fair value of the swap was an asset of $0.1 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $0.06 million, net of tax. At December 31, 2004, approximately 25% of our outstanding variable rate debt was economically fixed at an effective weighted average interest rate of 5.27% and our overall credit facility effective weighted average interest rate was 4.60% based upon current margins in effect ranging from 1.75% to 2.00%. On December 10, 2004 we entered into two forward interest rate swap agreements that will have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate at 3.875% effective July 1, 2005. The total amortizing notional amount of these two swaps is $800 million and both expire in January 2010 and require quarterly interest payments beginning in October 2005. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate notional amount of these swaps was $800 million and their fair value was an asset of $0.4 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $0.2 million, net of tax. As a result of our swap agreements, we will have over 80% of our outstanding variable rate debt economically fixed. 29 Table of Contents 2003 capital structure changes. In the first quarter of 2003, we borrowed $150 million that was available under the Term Loan A of our credit facility. The Term Loan A bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00% for an overall effective rate of 3.19% at December 31, 2003. In July 2003, we completed a call for redemption of all of our outstanding $125 million 5 5/8% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 by issuing 7,302,528 shares of our common stock from treasury stock for the conversion of nearly all the 5 5/8% Notes, and redeemed the balance for cash and accrued interest. In July 2003, we also entered into an amended credit agreement in order to, among other things, lower the overall interest rate. We also acquired an additional $200 million of borrowings under the replacement Term Loan B, which amounted to $1.042 billion. In November 2003, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement in order to again lower the interest rate on the Term Loan B and to modify certain covenants. In 2003 we completed a call for redemption of our $345 million, 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009. The 7% notes were redeemed for $363 million in cash, including accrued interest and 24,045 shares of common stock. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate of 3.39%, plus the Term Loan B margin of 2.00% for an overall effective rate of 5.39% as of December 31, 2004. The total amortizing notional amount of this swap was $135 million and was matched with Term Loan B outstanding debt. The agreement expires in November 2008 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2004, the notional amount of this swap was approximately $135 million and its fair value was an asset of $0.6 million which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $1.3 million, net of tax. During 2003, we repurchased a total of 5,162,850 shares of our common stock for approximately $107 million, or an average of $20.76 per share, pursuant to authorizations by the Board of Directors. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Nearly all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers, in the form of put options exercisable at the third party owners discretion. These put obligations, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital as needed to several third party centers including minority owned centers and centers that we operate under administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2004 (in millions): WithinOne Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 52 $ 80 $ 629 $ 607 $ 1,368 Capital lease obligations 1 4 1 2 8 Operating leases 74 132 102 189 497 $ 127 $ 216 $ 732 $ 798 $ 1,873 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 23 $ 23 Acquisition of dialysis centers 56 15 19 13 103 Working capital advances to third parties under administrative services agreements 15 15 $ 94 $ 15 $ 19 $ 13 $ 141 30 Table of Contents Contingencies Our revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements; and (5) claims for refunds from private payors. On October 25, 2004, we received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office, or U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. The subpoena covers the period from 1996 to present and requires the production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including our laboratory services. The subpoena also includes specific requests for documents relating to testing for parathyroid hormone levels, or PTH, and to products relating to vitamin D therapies. We believe that the subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena, including Fresenius Medical Care, Renal Care Group and Gambro Healthcare. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Compliance with the subpoena will require management attention and legal expense. We cannot predict whether legal proceedings will be initiated against us relating to this investigation or, if proceedings are initiated, the outcome of any such proceedings. In addition, criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. If a court determines that there has been wrongdoing, the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial. In February 2001 the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and financial relationships with physicians. We cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the U.S. Attorneys Office. In May 2002, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office and the Philadelphia Office of the OIG. The subpoena requires an update to the information we provided in our response to the February 2001 request, and also seeks a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services, as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The subpoena covers the period from May 1996 to May 2002. We have provided the documents requested and continue to cooperate with the United States Attorneys Office and the OIG in its investigation. If this review proceeds, the government could expand its areas of concern. If a court determines that there has been wrongdoing, the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these additional pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts, impairments and valuation adjustments, and accounting for income taxes, are considered 31 Table of Contents to be critical in evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize for a reporting period. The rates at which we are reimbursed are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the more than 1,500 commercial healthcare plans under which we receive reimbursements, often arbitrary and inconsistent reimbursements by commercial payors, ongoing insurance coverage changes, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on a) the reimbursement rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the reimbursement rates paid by the government payor (eg. 80% for Medicare patients) and b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (eg. Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for reimbursements, and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 50,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. Our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk is generally expected to be within 1% of total revenue, which can represent as much as 5% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses. For example, we recognized $22 million of prior period dialysis revenue in 2001 related to cash recoveries in excess of previous estimates made possible by improvements in our billing and collecting operations. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received after considering possible retroactive adjustments that may be made as a result of the ongoing third party carrier review. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as applicable. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset 32 Table of Contents will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, awards and benefit plan contributions, are updated periodically due to changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results may vary due to the subjective nature of fulfilling employee specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Significant new accounting standard for 2005 In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 123R, Share Based Payment, that amends FASB Statements No. 123 and 95, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. This statement requires a company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, such as stock options, based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize such cost over the requisite period during which an employee provides service. The grant date fair value will be determined using option pricing models adjusted for unique characteristics of the equity instruments. The statement also addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the Companys equity instruments or that may be settled through the issuance of such equity instruments. The statement does not change the accounting for transactions in which a company issues equity instruments for services to non employees or the accounting for employee stock ownership plans. This statement is effective beginning in the third quarter of 2005, and requires us to recognize compensation costs on outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. We currently project that the adoption of this standard will reduce pre tax income by less than $10 million for the second half of 2005. 33 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including the risks discussed below. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements under the heading Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. If the average rates that private payors pay us decline, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced. Approximately 40% of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have private payors as the primary payor. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us on terms and at rates materially higher than Medicare rates. Based on our recent experience in negotiating with private payors, we believe that pressure from private payors to decrease the rates they pay us may increase. If the average rates that private payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. If the number of patients with higher paying commercial insurance declines, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced. Our revenue levels are sensitive to the percentage of our reimbursements from higher paying commercial plans. A patients insurance coverage may change for a number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the patients or a family members employment status. For a patient covered by an employer group health plan, Medicare generally becomes the primary payor after 33 months, or earlier if the patients employer group health plan coverage terminates. When Medicare becomes the primary payor, the payment rate we receive for that patient shifts from the employer group health plan rate to the Medicare reimbursement rate. If there is a significant reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans relative to government based programs that pay at lower rates it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Future declines, or the lack of further increases, in Medicare reimbursement rates would reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Approximately one half of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have Medicare as their primary payor. The Medicare ESRD program reimburses us for dialysis and ancillary services at fixed rates. Unlike most other Medicare programs, the Medicare ESRD program does not provide for periodic inflation increases in reimbursement rates. Increases of 1.2% in 2000 and 2.4% in 2001 were the first increases in the composite reimbursement rate since 1991, and were significantly less than the cumulative rate of inflation over the same period. For 2002 through 2004, there was no increase in the composite reimbursement rate. Effective January 1, 2005, there was an increase of only 1.6%. Increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, have occurred and are expected to continue to occur regardless of whether there is a compensating increase in reimbursement rates. We cannot predict with certainty the nature or extent of future rate changes, if any. To the extent these rates decline or are not adjusted to keep pace with inflation, our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be adversely affected. Changes in the structure of, and reimbursement rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. The Medicare composite reimbursement rate covers the cost of treatment, including the supplies used in those treatments, specified laboratory tests and certain pharmaceuticals. Other services and pharmaceuticals, including EPO, vitamin D analogs and iron supplements, are separately billed. Changes to the structure of the composite rate and separately billable reimbursement rates became effective on January 1, 2005. These changes 34 Table of Contents more than offset the 1.6% composite rate increase that also became effective January 1, 2005. In addition, effective April 1, 2005, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, plans to implement a case mix adjustment payment methodology which is designed to pay differential composite service rates based on a variety of patient characteristics. If the case mix adjustment is not properly implemented it could adversely affect the Medicare reimbursement rates. Future changes in the structure of, and reimbursement rates under, the Medicare ESRD program could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. CMS continues to study the ESRD reimbursement system through a number of demonstration projects which will take place over the next few years. The changes that went into effect on January 1, 2005 include changes in the way we are reimbursed for certain pharmaceuticals that are currently billed outside the composite rate. Pharmaceuticals are approximately one half of our total Medicare revenues. If Medicare begins to include in its composite reimbursement rate pharmaceuticals, laboratory services or other ancillary services that it currently reimburses separately, or if there are further changes to or decreases in the reimbursement rate for these items without a corresponding increase in the composite rate, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Changes in state Medicaid programs or reimbursement rates could reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. More than 5% of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have Medicaid as their primary coverage. State governments may propose reductions in reimbursement rates, limitations on eligibility or other changes to Medicaid programs from time to time. If state governments reduce the rates paid by those programs for dialysis and related services, limit eligibility for Medicaid coverage or adopt changes similar to those adopted by Medicare, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected. Changes in clinical practices and reimbursement rates or rules for EPO and other pharmaceuticals could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. The administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals accounts for approximately 40% of our total dialysis revenues. Changes in physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices, changes in private and governmental reimbursement criteria, the introduction of new pharmaceuticals and the conversion to alternate types of administration could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. For example, some Medicare fiscal intermediaries (Medicare claims processing contractors) are seeking to implement local medical review policies for EPO and vitamin D analogs that would effectively limit utilization of and reimbursement for these pharmaceuticals. CMS has proposed a draft reimbursement policy that would direct all fiscal intermediaries with respect to reimbursement coverage for EPO. It is possible that the draft policy, if finalized, will affect physician prescription patterns and the timing of our cash flows due to changes in auditing methodology by fiscal intermediaries. Adverse developments with respect to EPO and the introduction of Aranesp&reg; could materially reduce our earnings and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients. Amgen is the sole supplier of EPO and may unilaterally decide to increase its price for EPO at any time. For example, Amgen unilaterally increased its base price for EPO by 3.9% in each of 2002, 2001 and 2000. Although we have entered into contracts for EPO pricing for a fixed time period that includes discount variables depending on certain clinical criteria and other criteria, we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the discount structure for EPO that we currently receive, or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of discounts within that structure as we have historically achieved. An increase in the cost of EPO could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows. Amgen has developed and obtained FDA approval for Aranesp&reg;, a new pharmaceutical used to treat anemia that may replace EPO or reduce its use with dialysis patients. Unlike EPO, which is generally administered in 35 Table of Contents conjunction with each dialysis treatment, Aranesp&reg; can remain effective for between two and three weeks. In the event that Amgen begins to market Aranesp&reg; for the treatment of dialysis patients, we may realize lower margins on the administration of Aranesp&reg; than are currently realized with EPO. In addition, some physicians may begin to administer Aranesp&reg; in their offices, which would prevent us from recognizing revenue or profit from the administration of EPO or Aranesp&reg; to those physicians patients. A significant increase in the use of Aranesp&reg; would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. The investigation related to the subpoena we received on October 25, 2004 from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York could result in substantial penalties against us. We are voluntarily cooperating with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and the OIG with respect to the subpoena we received on October 25, 2004, which requested a wide range of documents, including specific documents relating to testing of parathyroid hormone levels and products relating to vitamin D therapies. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena including Gambro Healthcare, Fresenius Medical Care and Renal Care Group. The U.S. Attorneys Office has also requested information regarding our Florida laboratory. Compliance with the subpoena will require management attention and legal expense. We are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved, whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters, financial or otherwise. In addition, criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. The pending federal review related to the subpoena we received in May 2002 from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania could result in substantial penalties against us. We are voluntarily cooperating with the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the OIG in a review of some historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures, financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies, and the provision of pharmaceutical and other ancillary services, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services. The U.S. Attorneys Office has also requested and received information regarding certain of our laboratories. We are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved, whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters, financial or otherwise. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations, federal and state anti kickback laws, Stark II physician self referral prohibition and analogous state referral statutes, and federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information. The regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers, including dialysis providers, has increased significantly in recent years. Medicare has increased the frequency and intensity of its certification surveys and inspections of dialysis centers have increased markedly in recent years. In addition, fiscal intermediaries are increasing their prepayment and post payment reviews. We endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with the anti kickback laws and the Stark II physicians self referral law. However, the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations. For example, none of our medical director agreements establishes compensation using the anti kickback safe harbor method; rather, compensation under our medical director agreements is the result of individual negotiation and the Company believes exceeds amounts determined in that manner. If an enforcement agency were to challenge the level of compensation that we pay our medical directors, we could be required to 36 Table of Contents change our practices, face criminal or civil penalties, pay substantial fines or otherwise experience a material adverse effect as a result of a challenge to these arrangements. Due to regulatory considerations unique to each of these states, all of our dialysis operations in New York and some of our dialysis operations in New Jersey are conducted by privately owned companies to which we provide a broad range of administrative services. These operations account for approximately 6% of our dialysis revenues. We believe that we have structured these operations to comply with the laws and regulations of these states, but we can give no assurances that they will not be challenged. If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows including: Mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses; Suspension or termination of our participation in government reimbursement programs; Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable reimbursement program requirements; Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government reimbursement programs; Loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate, including the loss of revenues from operations in New York and New Jersey conducted by privately owned companies as described above; Fines, damages or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations, Stark II violations, submission of false claims, civil or criminal liability based on violations of law, or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements and patient privacy law violations; Claims for monetary damages from patients who believe their protected health information has been used or disclosed in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws; and Termination of relationships with medical directors. We may be subject to liability claims for damages and other expenses not covered by insurance that could reduce our earnings and cash flows. The administration of dialysis and related services to patients may subject us to litigation and liability for damages. Our business, profitability and growth prospects could suffer if we face negative publicity or we pay damages or defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope of any applicable insurance coverage. We currently maintain programs of general and professional liability insurance. However, a successful professional liability, malpractice or negligence claim in excess of our insurance coverage could harm our profitability and liquidity. In addition, if our costs of insurance and claims increase, then our earnings could decline. Market rates for insurance premiums and deductibles have been steadily increasing. Our earnings and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following: Further increases in premiums and deductibles; Increases in the number of liability claims against us or the cost of settling or trying cases related to those claims; and An inability to obtain one or more types of insurance on acceptable terms. If businesses we acquire have unknown liabilities, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Our business strategy includes the acquisition of dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate dialysis centers. Businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities or liabilities that are in excess of the amounts that we had estimated. These liabilities could include liabilities arising as a result of any failure to adhere to laws and regulations governing dialysis operations, such as violations of federal or state anti kickback statutes or Stark II. Although we generally seek indemnification from the sellers of businesses we acquire for 37 Table of Contents matters that are not properly disclosed to us, we are not always successful. In addition, even in cases where we are able to obtain indemnification, we may discover liabilities greater than the contractual limits or the financial resources of the indemnifying party. In the event that we are responsible for liabilities substantially in excess of any amounts recovered through rights to indemnification, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced. Many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at dialysis centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical directors of the centers. As a result, the primary referral source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center. If a medical director agreement terminates, whether before or at the end of its term, and a new medical director is appointed, it may negatively impact the former medical directors decision to treat his or her patients at our center. Additionally, both current and former medical directors have no obligation to refer their patients to our centers. Also, if the quality of service levels at our centers deteriorate, it may negatively impact patient referrals and treatment volumes. Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally five to ten years. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us. As of January 1, 2005, there were 59 centers, accounting for approximately 9% of our 2004 treatment volume, at which the medical director agreements require renewal on or before December 31, 2005. We may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships to assure compliance with the safe harbor provisions of the anti kickback statute, Stark II law and other similar laws. These actions could negatively impact the decision of physicians to extend their medical director agreements with us or to refer their patients to us. If the terms of any existing agreement are found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship which could lead to the early termination of the agreement, or force the physician to stop referring patients to the centers. If our joint ventures were found to violate the law, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. As of December 31, 2004 we operated 128 dialysis centers, representing approximately 15% of our dialysis revenue, that are owned by joint ventures in which we own a controlling interest and one or more physicians or physician practice groups have a minority interest. The physician owners may also provide medical director services to those centers or other centers we own and operate. Because our relationships with physicians are governed by the anti kickback statute contained in the Social Security Act, we have sought to structure our joint venture arrangements to satisfy as many safe harbor requirements as possible. However, our joint venture arrangements do not satisfy all elements of any safe harbor under the federal anti kickback statute. Based on the exceptions applicable to ESRD services, we believe that our joint venture arrangements and operations materially comply with the Stark II law. If the joint ventures are found to be in violation of the anti kickback statute or the Stark provisions, we could be required to restructure the joint ventures or refuse to accept referrals for designated health services from the physicians with whom the joint venture centers have a financial relationship. We also could be required to repay to Medicare amounts received by the joint ventures pursuant to prohibited referrals, and we could be subject to monetary penalties and exclusion from government healthcare programs. If our joint venture centers are subject to any of these penalties, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. 38 Table of Contents The level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business. We have substantial debt outstanding and if we consummate the proposed Gambro Healthcare acquisition we will incur substantial additional debt. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The level of our current and proposed indebtedness, among other things, could: make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt securities; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes; expose us to interest rate fluctuations because the interest on the debt under some of our indebtedness may be at variable rates; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. If additional debt financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to grow our business, take advantage of business opportunities, respond to competitive pressures or refinance maturing debt, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. We will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts, including any strategic acquisitions we may make in the future, will depend on our ability to generate cash. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that our currently anticipated growth in revenue and cash flow will be realized on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Our senior secured credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets. As such, our ability to refinance our debt or seek additional financing could be limited by such security interest. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel continues, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses. We are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. We compete for nurses with hospitals and other health care providers. This nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations. If we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, our operations and treatment growth will be negatively impacted, which would result in reduced revenues, earnings and cash flows. 39 Table of Contents Provisions in our charter documents, compensation programs and Delaware law may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests. Our charter documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent, requiring 90 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our Board of Directors and granting our Board of Directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval, and a poison pill that would substantially dilute the interest sought by an acquirer that our Board of Directors does not approve. In addition, most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control. We have also adopted a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock awards, which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. Based on the shares of our common stock outstanding and the market price of our stock on December 31, 2004, these cash bonuses would total approximately $149 million if a control transaction occurred at that price and our Board of Directors did not modify the program. These compensation programs may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law that, subject to exceptions, would prohibit us from engaging in any business combinations with any interested stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder. These restrictions may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of our Company. These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our Company at a price that our stockholders may find attractive. These provisions could also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. The Gambro Healthcare acquisition is significantly larger than any other acquisition we have made to date. We will face challenges integrating the Gambro Healthcare centers and may not realize anticipated benefits. The Gambro Healthcare acquisition is the largest acquisition we have attempted to date. There is a risk that, due to the size of the acquisition, we will be unable to integrate Gambro Healthcare into our operations as effectively as we have with prior acquisitions, which would result in fewer benefits to us from the acquisition than currently anticipated as well as increased costs. The integration of the Gambro Healthcare operations will require implementation of appropriate operations, management and financial reporting systems and controls. We may experience difficulties in effectively implementing these and other systems and integrating Gambro Healthcares systems and operations. In addition, the integration of Gambro Healthcare will require the focused attention of our management team, including a significant commitment of their time and resources. The need for management to focus on integration matters, could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues and operating results. If the integration is not successful or if our Gambro Healthcare operations are less profitable than we currently anticipate, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. We will assume substantially all of Gambro Healthcares liabilities, including contingent liabilities. If these liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are unknown Gambro Healthcare obligations, our business could be materially and adversely affected. As a result of the Gambro Healthcare acquisition, we will assume substantially all of Gambro Healthcares liabilities, including contingent liabilities. We may learn additional information about Gambro Healthcares 40 Table of Contents business that adversely affects us, such as unknown liabilities, issues relating to internal controls over financial reporting, issues that could affect our ability to comply with the Sarbanes Oxley Act after we acquire Gambro Healthcare or issues that could affect our ability to comply with other applicable laws, including laws and regulations governing dialysis operations. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Gambro Healthcare acquisition will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. Among other things, if Gambro Healthcares liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are obligations of Gambro Healthcare of which we are not aware at the time of completion of the acquisition, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We have limited indemnification rights in connection with these and other regulatory compliance and litigation matters affecting Gambro Healthcare, as well as known contingent liabilities of Gambro Healthcare that we will assume. For example, Gambro Healthcare was served a complaint regarding a former employee and a putative class of employees in California for claims relating to California labor laws. Although this matter is subject to indemnification under the acquisition agreement, claims relating to this matter may exceed the limit on our indemnification rights. Gambro Healthcare may also have other unknown liabilities which we will be responsible for after the acquisition. If we are responsible for liabilities not covered by indemnification rights or substantially in excess of amounts covered through any indemnification rights, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows. The integration of Gambro Healthcare and the realization of cost savings will require us to make significant expenditures. In order to obtain the cost savings and operating income that we believe the integration of Gambro Healthcare should provide, we will be required to make significant expenditures. We are in the early stages of planning for the integration process and are uncertain as to the extent and amount of these expenditures. Further, given the amount of indebtedness that we will incur as part of the Gambro Healthcare acquisition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing required for any significant expenditures on favorable terms or at all. In addition, we may not achieve the cost savings we expect through the integration of the Gambro Healthcare operations regardless of our expenditures, which failure would materially and adversely affect our financial results. The costs associated with compliance with the corporate integrity agreement could be substantial and may be greater than we currently anticipate. If we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for Gambro Healthcare employees after the acquisition, we may not be able to effectively integrate their operations. In order to successfully integrate the Gambro Healthcare operations into our own, we will require the services of Gambro Healthcares clinical, operating and administrative employees. If we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for Gambro Healthcare employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate Gambro Healthcares systems and operations. If we lose the services of a significant number of Gambro Healthcares medical directors, our results of operations could be harmed. Certain of Gambro Healthcares contracts with its medical directors provide that the contract is terminable upon a change of control of Gambro Healthcare. These termination provisions would be triggered by our acquisition of Gambro Healthcare. If we lose the services of a significant number of Gambro Healthcares medical directors, our results of operations may be harmed. Our alliance and product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products Inc. will limit our ability to achieve costs savings with respect to products and equipment we are required to purchase under this agreement. In connection with the Gambro Healthcare acquisition, we will enter into a ten year alliance and product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products Inc., a subsidiary of Gambro AB, pursuant to which we will be 41 Table of Contents required to purchase from Gambro Renal Products specified percentages of our requirements for hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices. This will limit our ability to realize future cost savings in regard to these products and equipment. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, our total spending on hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment was approximately 8% of our total operating costs. If Gambro Renal Products is unable to fulfill its obligations under the agreement, we may have difficulty finding alternative sources of supplies on favorable financial terms, further reducing our ability to achieve cost savings. In addition, as we replace existing equipment from other third party manufacturers with Gambro Renal Products equipment, we may incur additional expenses as we transition to this new equipment. The consummation of the Gambro Healthcare acquisition is subject to a number of conditions; if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, we will not be able to consummate the acquisition. The stock purchase agreement relating to the Gambro Healthcare acquisition contains a number of conditions which must be satisfied or waived prior to the closing of the acquisition. These conditions include, among others, execution and delivery of the transition services agreement and the alliance product and supply agreement and receipt of regulatory approvals, including antitrust clearance. On February 18, 2005, we received a request from the Federal Trade Commission for additional information in connection with its review of our anti trust filing. We intend to respond promptly to this request. The effect of the second request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the Hart Scott Rodino Act until thirty days after we and Gambro Healthcare have substantially complied with the request, unless that period is extended voluntarily by us and Gambro Healthcare or is terminated sooner by the FTC. In addition, one or more states Attorneys General could attempt to impose conditions or otherwise interfere with the proposed acquisition. In connection with obtaining antitrust clearance, we may decide to, or the Federal Trade Commission or other regulatory agencies with jurisdiction may request that we divest certain of our or Gambro Healthcares dialysis centers. These divestitures could be material. In addition, we will require financing in order to consummate the Gambro Healthcare acquisition. We have obtained acquisition financing commitments from a group of financial institutions, however such commitments are subject to customary conditions. We therefore cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all or that we will be able to consummate the Gambro Healthcare acquisition on the terms described herein or at all. If we do not cause Gambro Healthcare to comply and Gambro Healthcare does not comply with its corporate integrity agreement, or Gambro Healthcare otherwise has failed or fails to comply with applicable government regulations to its operations, we could be subject to additional penalties and otherwise may be materially harmed. On December 1, 2004, Gambro Healthcare entered into a settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States government relating to the Department of Justices investigation of Gambro Healthcares Medicare and Medicaid billing practices and its relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers. In connection with the settlement agreement, Gambro Healthcare, without admitting liability, made a one time payment of approximately $310 million and entered into a corporate integrity agreement with HHS. In addition, its subsidiary, Gambro Supply Corp., entered a plea of guilty to a one count felony charge related to the conduct of its predecessor, REN Supply Corp., and paid a criminal fine of $25 million. Gambro Supply Corp. was excluded from participation in federal health care programs. However, no other Gambro AB affiliates were so excluded. Gambro Healthcare also agreed to voluntarily cooperate with the government in connection with its further investigation. The corporate integrity agreement applies to all of Gambro Healthcares centers and requires, among other things, that Gambro Healthcare implement additional training, engage an independent review organization to conduct an annual review of certain of its reimbursement claims, and submit to the OIG an annual report with respect to its compliance activities. Moreover, Gambro Healthcare has reached a preliminary understanding with the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units to settle the related claims of the affected state Medicaid programs for a one time payment of $15 million plus interest accruing at the rate of 5% per annum from December 1, 2004. Completion of the Medicaid settlement is subject to confirmation of certain claims data and negotiation and execution of settlement 42 Table of Contents agreements with the relevant states. As a result of the settlement agreement, private payors and other third parties may initiate legal proceedings against Gambro Healthcare related to the billing practices and other matters covered by the settlement agreement. If we do not cause Gambro Healthcare to comply, and Gambro Healthcare does not comply, with the terms of the corporate integrity agreement or otherwise has failed or fails to comply with the extensive federal, state and local government regulations applicable to its operations, we could be subject to additional penalties, including monetary penalties or suspension from participation in government reimbursement programs, and otherwise may be materially harmed. The costs associated with compliance with the corporate integrity agreement and cooperation with the government could be substantial and may be greater than we currently anticipate. 43 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2004. For our debt obligations with variable interest rates, the rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of 2004 including the economic effects of our swap agreements. These rates are based on LIBOR plus margins based upon performance and leverage criteria plus the impact from the swap agreements. The margins currently in effect range from 1.75% to 2.00%. Expected maturity date Total Fair Value Average interest rate 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 5 $ 1 $ 3 $ 3 $ 13 $ 13 5.53 % Variable rate $ 48 $ 55 $ 25 $ 15 $ 614 $ 606 $ 1,363 $ 1,363 4.63 % Our senior credit facility is based on a floating LIBOR interest rate plus a margin, which is reset periodically and can be locked in for a maximum of six months. As a result, our interest expense is subject to fluctuations as LIBOR interest rates change. We have entered into three interest rate swap agreements, two matched on our Term Loan B outstanding debt and one matched on our Term Loan C outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2004, the total notional amount of these swap agreements was $345 million and the interest rates were economically modified to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 3.64% plus the Term Loan margins ranging from 1.75% to 2.00%, in effect as of December 31, 2004. This resulted in an overall effective rate of 5.27% as of December 31, 2004, on approximately 25% of our outstanding debt. Two of the swap agreements expire in 2008 and one in 2009. As of December 31, 2004, the fair value of the swaps was an asset of $2.4 million. As a result of these swap agreements, our overall effective weighted average interest rate of our credit facility was 4.60% based upon current margins in effect ranging from 1.75% to 2.00% as of December 31, 2004. We also have entered into two forward interest rate swap agreements that will have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to become a fixed rate at 3.875% effective July 1, 2005. The total amortizing notional amount of the two swaps is $800 million and both expire in January 2010 and require quarterly interest payments beginning in October 2005. As of December 31, 2004, the fair value of these swaps was an asset of $0.4 million. As a result of all of our swap agreements, we will have over 80% of our outstanding variable rate debt economically fixed. One means of assessing exposure to interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $5.9 million, $6.5 million and $3.5 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk. 44 Table of Contents
