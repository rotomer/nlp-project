Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the notes to our consolidated financial statements. On September 11, 2003, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $200 million of the Companys common stock, with no expiration date. On November 2, 2004, the Company announced that the Board of Directors approved an increase in the Companys authorization to repurchase shares of its common stock by an additional $200 million. The Company is authorized to make purchases from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other considerations. However, under the terms of our credit facilities and our Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes, we have share repurchase limitations. There were no repurchases of our common stock during 2005. We had approximately $249 million available from Board authorizations to repurchase shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2005. 29 Table of Contents Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The following table presents selected consolidated financial and operating data for the periods indicated. In October 2005, we completed the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare which was one of the largest dialysis services providers in the United States operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion, for approximately $3.06 billion, subject to a tax basis step up election as discussed above. In conjunction with a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission, on October 4, 2005, we divested a total of 71 centers in order to complete the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. See footnote (5) below. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results from October 1, 2005, and the operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. The following financial and operating data should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this report.

(3) The swap valuation net gains of $4,548 in 2005, represented the accumulated fair value on several swap instruments that were ineffective as cash flow hedges, as a result of the repayment of our credit facilities, as well as changes in the fair values of these swaps until they were redesignated, and represent changes in the fair value of the swaps during periods in which there was no matching variable rate LIBOR based interest payments. (4) Refinancing charges of $8,170 in 2005 represented the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the extinguishment of our prior credit facility. Refinancing charges of $26,501 in 2003 represented the consideration paid to redeem the $125,000 5 5/8% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 and the $345,000 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 in excess of book value, the write off of related deferred financing costs and other financing fees associated with the amendment of the prior credit facility. Refinancing charges of $48,930 in 2002 represented the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the retirement of the $225,000 outstanding 9 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011. Refinancing gains of $1,629 in 2001 related to the write off of deferred financing costs offset by accelerated swap liquidation gains from debt refinancing. (5) During 2005, we divested a total of 71 outpatient dialysis centers in conjunction with a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission on October 4, 2005 in order for us to complete the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. In addition, we completed the sale of three additional centers that were previously pending state regulatory approval in January 2006. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested and held for sale centers are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. (6) All share and per share data for all periods presented prior to 2005 have been adjusted to retroactively reflect the effects of a 3 for 2 stock split that occurred in the second quarter of 2004. (7) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed by dividing earnings by fixed charges. Earnings for this purpose is defined as pretax income from continuing operations adjusted by adding back fixed charges expensed during the period. Fixed charges include debt expense (interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs), the estimated interest component of rental expense on operating leases, and capitalized interest. (8) Share repurchases consisted of 3,350,100 shares of common stock for $96,540 in 2004, 5,162,850 shares of common stock for $107,162 in 2003, 40,991,216 shares of common stock for $642,171 in 2002 and 1,333,050 shares of common stock for $20,360 in 2001. Debt of $124,700 and $526 was converted into 7,302,528 and 24,045 shares of common stock in 2003.

The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,233 outpatient dialysis centers and 795 hospitals, serving approximately 96,000 patients. In October 2005, we acquired DVA Renal Healthcare, Inc. (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare, Inc.), one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, for approximately $3.06 billion, subject to a tax basis step up adjustment, and entered into a 10 year Alliance and Product Supply Agreement with Gambro valued as a $162 million intangible liability. At the time of the acquisition, DVA Renal Healthcare was operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results effective October 1, 2005. In accordance with a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission on October 4, 2005, we were required to divest a total of 69 outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements in order for us to complete the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. In 2005, we divested a total of 71 centers and terminated the two management services agreements. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, we completed the sale of three additional centers that were previously pending state regulatory approval. We received total cash consideration of approximately $330 million for all of the centers divested and used approximately $13 million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture, to distribute a minority owners share of the sale proceeds, and to pay related transaction costs. We anticipate paying related income taxes of approximately 32 Table of Contents $90 million. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers and its one management services agreement are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Our stated mission is to be the provider, employer and partner of choice. We believe our attention to these three areas our patients, our teammates, and our business partners represent the major drivers of our long term success, aside from external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes have improved over each of the past three years, and we ended 2005 with the best clinical outcomes that we have ever achieved. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. Over the past several years we have achieved significant reductions in teammate turnover, which has been a major contributor to our performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. We are pleased with the overall clinical, operating and financial performance levels achieved over the past three years. Although our business has areas of significant potential exposure, as delineated in the risk factors in Item 1A, under the heading Risk Factors, our operating results over the past three years have not been significantly adversely affected by these risk factors, although we cannot provide any assurance that they will not have an impact in the future. Our operations represent a single reporting segment, with more than 95% of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis services, of which 85% represents outpatient hemodialysis services in 1,195 centers that are wholly owned or majority owned. Other direct dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our center operations, are peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services. The principal drivers of our revenue are a) the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week, and b) average treatment revenue. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our pace of opening and acquiring new centers. The number of dialysis treatments increased approximately 36% in 2005 as compared to 2004 and approximately 11% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare accounted for approximately 23% of treatment volume growth for 2005, and represented approximately 44% of the total treatments in the fourth quarter of 2005. Approximately 8% of the increase in the number of treatments in 2005 resulted from routine acquisitions and approximately 5% was due to increased treatments in existing centers. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 6% of our 2004 year over year treatment volume growth, with the remaining 5% attributable to increased treatments in existing centers. Average revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, and our dialysis services charge capture, billing and collecting operations performance. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are more than double Medicare and Medicaid payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment. Approximately 87% of our patients are currently covered under government programs (principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare assigned HMO plans). The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare did not materially affect this patient mix percentage. 33 Table of Contents Approximately 65% of our total dialysis revenue is from government based programs. Government payment rates are principally determined by federal (Medicare) and state (Medicaid) policy. These payment rates have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of being reduced. Medicare revenues represent approximately 50% of our dialysis revenue. Cumulative net increases in Medicare payment rates from 1990 through 2005 total approximately 5%. There were no Medicare payment rate increases for 2003 and 2004. A 1.6% increase was effective on January 1, 2005, however this increase was more than offset by other structural changes to Medicare dialysis payment rates that also became effective January 1, 2005. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, CMS implemented a 1.6% increase. Medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures. Approximately 35% of our dialysis revenue is from commercial insurance and managed care plans. Commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are at contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Over the past three years we have been successful in maintaining relatively stable average payment rates in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases, although we expect continued pressure on commercial payment rates. Approximately 35% of our dialysis revenue has been associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for approximately 25% of our dialysis revenue. Therefore changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, and pharmaceutical intensities significantly influence our revenue levels. Such changes, driven by physician practice patterns and protocols focused on improving clinical outcomes, accounted for a significant portion of the increase in average revenue per treatment in 2004. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services charge capture, billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past three years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduce our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. We are in the process of upgrading our billing and collections systems as we integrate our systems with DVA Renal Healthcares systems which may impact our collections performance. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis revenue per treatment for continuing operations was $313, $313 and $305 for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The revenue per treatment averages for continuing operations for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2005, prior to the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, were approximately $317 and $314 per treatment, respectively. Principal factors affecting our average revenue per treatment were increases in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue), changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial contract negotiations, together with a relatively stable mix of commercial patients and commercial rates. The combined average revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter 2005, including DVA Renal Healthcares results from October 1, 2005, was $311 per treatment. The decrease in average revenue per treatment in the fourth quarter reflects the effect of lower average revenue per treatment attributable to the DVA Renal Healthcare centers and a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals in the quarter. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future. Additionally, the integration process for the DVA Renal Healthcare billing system could adversely affect our collections through the two to three year transition period. The principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also 34 Table of Contents represent significant cost changes such as increased insurance costs experienced in 2004. Our average clinical hours per treatment have improved over the past three years primarily because of reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in 2004 and 2005, and federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. Labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends. For the past three years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors. We expect relatively stable pricing through 2006, however, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO includes volume discount and other thresholds which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to meet those thresholds. Our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare did not have a significant impact on our overall patient costs on a per treatment basis in the fourth quarter of 2005. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenues over the past three years. However, this reflects substantial increases in spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes, legal and other professional fees, and expanding support functions. We expect that these higher levels of general and administrative expenses will be generally maintained or increased to support our long term initiatives and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Approximately $11 million in integration costs associated with the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare were incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005, and we currently expect integration costs to be in the range of $50 million in 2006, exclusive of capital asset expenditures. Although other revenues represent less than 5% of total revenues, successful resolutions of disputed Medicare billings at our Florida lab resulted in recoveries related to prior years services being recognized as current period revenue and operating income of approximately $4 million, $8 million, and $24 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Outlook for 2006. We are currently targeting operating income in 2006 to be in the $630 $700 million range before the impact of FASB No. 123R related to stock based compensation expense. We currently expect that our pre tax stock option expense will be in the range of $20 million to $30 million, significantly dependent on the timing and amounts of grants in 2006, as well as the Companys stock price at those future dates. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients, possible reductions in private and government payment rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with our physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the ongoing review by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the OIG, the subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and the subpoenas from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, DVA Renal Healthcares compliance with its corporate integrity agreement, and our ability to complete and integrate acquisitions of businesses, including the integration of DVA Renal Healthcare. You should read Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 32 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. 35 Table of Contents Results of operations Following is a summary of operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. Prior year operating results have been restated to reflect only continuing operations. Year ended December 31, Continuing Operations 2005 2004 2003 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, except per treatment data) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 2,970 100 % $ 2,169 100 % $ 1,895 100 % Prior years services laboratory 4 8 24 2,974 2,177 1,919 Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 2,036 69 % 1,470 68 % 1,288 68 % General and administrative 272 9 % 192 9 % 160 8 % Depreciation and amortization 117 4 % 83 4 % 71 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 62 2 % 39 2 % 34 2 % Minority interests and equity income, net 22 12 7 Total operating expenses and charges 2,509 85 % 1,796 83 % 1,560 82 % Operating income including prior years recoveries (i.e., including amounts in italics) $ 465 $ 381 $ 360 Dialysis treatments 9,044,966 6,654,069 6,015,201 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 28,898 21,225 19,224 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 313 $ 313 $ 305 The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results from October 1, 2005. Our operating income margins, excluding recoveries for prior years lab services, declined from 17.2% in 2004 to 15.5% in 2005, primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs, and the effects of the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. The average revenue per treatment rates attributable to DVA Renal Healthcare centers are lower than our average rates before the acquisition, and we incurred approximately $11 million in integration costs in the fourth quarter of 2005. Our combined operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2005 was approximately 14%. Net operating revenues Operating revenues for current period services increased 37% in 2005 compared to 2004 and 14% in 2004 compared to 2003. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare in the fourth quarter of 2005 accounted for approximately 22% of the increase in 2005, approximately 12% was due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments with the balance of approximately 3% due to additional increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment and additional lab, management fees and ancillary revenue. Approximately 11% of the increase in 2004 was due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments with the balance attributable to increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment. Dialysis revenues represented approximately 95%, 96% and 96% of net operating revenues in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Lab and other ancillary services and management fee income accounted for the balance of revenues. Dialysis revenues. We generate approximately 85%, 9% and 6% of our total dialysis revenue from outpatient hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and home based dialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis, respectively. Major components of dialysis revenues include the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents approximately 35% of total dialysis revenues. Approximately 65% of our total dialysis revenues are from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage Plans, representing approximately 87% of our total patients. Our 36 Table of Contents non government payors consist principally of commercial insurance plans, including more than 500 with whom we have contracted rates. Additionally, we have approximately 1,500 single patient agreements establishing our payment rates for patients not covered by other contracts. Approximately 10 percent of our revenue is associated with non contracted commercial plans. Less than one percent of our dialysis services payments were received directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounts for more than 5% of total dialysis revenues. On average we are paid at more than double the Medicare or Medicaid rates for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans. Patients covered by employer group health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As of year end 2005, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $134 and $159 per treatment, or an overall average of $145 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. The majority of our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. The commercial payment rates are under continuous downward pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers, and may be further negatively impacted by the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. Our year over year treatment volume growth was as follows: 2005 2004 Treatment growth related to: Existing and newly opened centers 5.4 % 5.8 % Routine center acquisitions 7.5 % 5.0 % DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition effective 10/1/05 23.0 % Total treatment growth 35.9 % 10.8 % The average dialysis revenue per treatment for continuing operations was $313, $313 and $305 for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The revenue per treatment averages for continuing operations for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2005, prior to the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, were approximately $317 and $314 per treatment, respectively. Principal factors affecting our average revenue per treatment were increases in our standard fee schedules (impacting non contracted commercial revenue), changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial contract negotiations, together with a relatively stable mix of commercial patients and commercial rates. The combined average revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter 2005, including DVA Renal Healthcares results effective October 1 2005, was $311 per treatment. The decrease in average revenue per treatment in the fourth quarter reflects a lower average revenue per treatment attributable to the DVA Renal Healthcare centers and a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals in the quarter. DVA Renal Healthcares percentage mix of government and non government patients is similar to our historical percentages. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future. Additionally, the integration process for the DVA Renal Healthcare billing system could adversely affect our collections through the two to three year transition period. Lab and other services. Lab and other services represented approximately 4% of net operating revenues for 2005 and 2004. A third party carrier review of Medicare claims associated with our Florida based laboratory was initiated in 1998. No Medicare payments were received for our lab services from the second quarter of 1998 until the third quarter of 2002 while we were appealing the Medicare payment withholds. Following a favorable administrative law judge ruling in June 2002, payments for the earliest review periods, as well as for current lab services, were received in the third quarter of 2002. Favorable rulings were subsequently received for the other review periods, resulting in additional recoveries. Prior year recoveries include approximately $59 million received in 2002, $24 million in 2003, $8 million in 2004, and $4 million in 2005. As of December 31, 2005, there are no significant unresolved Medicare lab billing issues. 37 Table of Contents Management fee income. Management fee income represented less than 1% of net operating revenues for 2005 and 2004. We operated or provided administrative services to 38 and 34 third party or minority owned dialysis centers as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our management fees are principally based on a percentage of the revenue of the managed operations, or based upon a percentage of operating income. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and facility costs. As a percentage of current period operating revenues, patient care costs were approximately 69% for 2005, 68% for 2004 and 68% for 2003. On a per treatment basis, patient care costs increased year over year approximately $4 and $7 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2005 was principally due to higher labor and benefit costs, and to a lesser extent medical supply costs. The overall average patient care costs per treatment in the fourth quarter of 2005 were $228 or approximately $4 higher than the full year average. This increase in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by higher pharmaceutical and other medical supply costs, and reflects the blended average of the combined operations after the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to higher labor costs and increases in the levels of revenue generating physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The higher labor costs reflect rising labor rates and the effect of the increase in the number of newly opened centers, which are not yet at normal productivity levels. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and include expenses for corporate and divisional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions, and regulatory compliance oversight. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of current period operating revenues were 9.2%, 8.9%, and 8.4% in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expense for 2005 was primarily due to infrastructure costs for expanding business operations, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives and government investigations, higher labor costs, and integration costs associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. The increase in 2004 principally consisted of higher labor costs, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives, and increases in support infrastructure for corporate initiatives and business expansion. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was approximately 4% of current period operating revenues for each of the past three years, and for the fourth quarter of 2005. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding valuations of intangibles acquired or assumed in connection with the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. Provision for uncollectible accounts. As a result of the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition and the higher historical provision rate for DVA Renal Healthcare, the post acquisition average provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2005. The provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately 2.1% of current period operating revenues for the full year 2005, and 1.8% for 2004 and 2003. Minority interests and equity income, net. Minority interests net of equity income increased in 2005 by approximately $10 million over 2004 due to an increase in new centers having minority partners as well as growth in the earnings of our joint ventures. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, and investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. 38 Table of Contents Other income Other income, which was a net of approximately $9 million, $4 million, and $3 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, consisted principally of interest income. Debt expense and refinancing charges Debt expense for 2005, 2004, and 2003 consisted of interest expense of approximately $134 million, $50 million, and $64 million, respectively, and amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $5 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004, and $3 million in 2003. The increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to borrowings under our new credit facility in connection with the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, increases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates and issuance of our new senior and senior subordinated notes that have average fixed interest rates of approximately 7.0%, offset by changes in our LIBOR based receipts from swap settlements. The decrease in interest expense in 2004 as compared to 2003 was due to changes in the mix of our debt instruments. For most of 2003 we incurred higher interest rates on our senior subordinated notes, which were paid off in the second half of 2003 and replaced with lower interest rate borrowings from our prior credit facility. This decrease was partially offset by the effect on interest rates from our swap agreements and higher average debt balances. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2005 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 37.4%, compared with 38.6%, and 39.0% in 2004 and 2003. The lower effective tax rates for 2005 and 2004 were primarily due to lower state income taxes and tax valuation allowance adjustments. We currently project that the effective income tax rate for 2006 will be in the range of 39% to 40%. The higher projected rate for 2006 is principally due to favorable tax valuation adjustments in 2005, higher effective state income tax rates, and lower levels of tax exempt interest income. Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2005 and 2004 represented approximately 71 and 69 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt provision. The relative increase in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2005 reflects an increased level of delayed billings and delayed cash collections associated with the Medicare certification process for newly opened and acquired centers, as well as general collection patterns. As of December 31, 2005 approximately $47 million in unreserved accounts receivable, which represented less than 6% of our total unreserved accounts receivable balance, were more than six months old. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than one half of 1% of our treatments are classified as patient pay. Virtually all revenue realized is from government and non government third party payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2005, other than the standard monthly processing, consisted of approximately $24 million associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other accounts receivable. Our Medicare bad debt claims are typically not paid to us until the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims, and such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements except for potentially limiting the collectibility of Medicare bad debt claims. DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition On October 5, 2005, we completed our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, Inc. (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare, Inc.) from Gambro, Inc. under a Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 6, 2004, for $3.06 billion, subject to a tax basis step up election. DVA Renal Healthcare was one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers serving approximately 43,000 39 Table of Contents patients and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion. We have incurred approximately $29 million in acquisition related costs through December 31, 2005. If we make an election pursuant to section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code as permitted under the Stock Purchase Agreement, we would be required to make an additional cash payment to Gambro Inc., which we currently estimate to be approximately $170 million. This election would result in tax benefits realizable over 15 years. In conjunction with the acquisition, we entered into an Alliance and Product Supply Agreement (the Supply Agreement) with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. for a minimum of 10 years. The Supply Agreement has an initial term of seven years and will automatically renew for three additional one year periods if we have not negotiated the terms of an extension during the initial term period. Under the Supply Agreement we are committed to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices. For the year ended December 31, 2005 our total expenditures on such items was approximately 8% of our total operating costs. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Divestitures per Federal Trade Commission Consent Order. As a condition of completing the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, we were required by the Federal Trade Commission to divest a total of 69 outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements. On October 6, 2005, DaVita and DVA Renal Healthcare completed the sale of 70 outpatient renal dialysis centers to Renal Advantage Inc., formerly known as RenalAmerica, Inc. and also completed the sale of one other center to a separate physician group, and terminated the two management services agreements. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, we completed the sale of three additional centers to Renal Advantage Inc. that were previously pending state regulatory approval in Illinois. We received total cash consideration of approximately $330 million for all of the centers divested and used approximately $13 million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture, to distribute a minority owners share of the sale proceeds, and to pay related transaction costs. We anticipate paying related income taxes of approximately $90 million on these divestitures. As part of this transaction, Renal Advantage assumed specific liabilities related to the centers and all other liabilities were retained by the Company. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers are accounted for as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2005 our cash balance was $432 million and we had undrawn credit facilities totaling $250 million, of which approximately $50 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations over the next twelve months. Cash flow from operations during 2005 amounted to $486 million, compared with $420 million, including after tax Medicare lab recoveries of $17 million for 2004. Non operating cash outflows in 2005 included $161 million for capital asset expenditures, including $93 million for new center developments and $3,202 million for acquisitions. We also received in 2005 approximately $298 million from the sale of discontinued operations. Non operating cash outflows in 2004 included $128 million for capital asset expenditures, including $83 million for new center developments, $266 million for acquisitions and $97 million for stock repurchases. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare in the fourth quarter of 2005 resulted in the net addition of 492 dialysis centers after related divestitures. We acquired 54 other dialysis centers and opened 46 new dialysis centers during 2005. During 2004, we acquired a total of 51 dialysis centers and opened 44 new dialysis centers. The largest acquisition during 2004 was the purchase of the common stock of Physicians Dialysis, Inc. (PDI), for approximately $150 million, which added 24 centers. We currently expect to spend approximately $125 million to $135 million for general capital asset expenditures in 2006, and approximately $130 million to $150 million for new center development and center acquisitions. Our current projections include opening approximately 40 new centers in 2006. We expect to 40 Table of Contents generate approximately $410 million to $480 million of operating cash flow in 2006, before capital expenditures and acquisitions. 2005 capital structure changes. On October 5, 2005, we entered into a new credit agreement allowing for borrowings of up to $3.05 billion. The facilities under the credit agreement consist of a $250 million six year revolving credit facility, a $350 million six year term loan A facility and a $2,450 million seven year term loan B facility (the Facilities). Existing borrowings under the Facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus margins initially ranging from 2.00% to 2.25%. The margins are subject to adjustment depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios and can range from 1.50% to 2.25% for the revolving credit facility and the term loan A, and 2.00% to 2.25% for the term loan B. The Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets. The credit agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and requires compliance with financial covenants, including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio that determine the interest rate margins described above. The aggregate amount of the Facilities may be increased by up to $500 million as long as no default exists or would result from such increase and we remain in compliance with the financial covenants after such increase. Such additional loans would be on substantially the same terms as the original borrowings under the Facilities. The term loan A requires annual principal payments of $35 million in 2006, $39.4 million in 2007, $52.5 million in 2008, $61.2 million in 2009, $87.5 million in 2010, and $65.6 in 2011, maturing in October 2011. The term loan B requires annual principal payments of $24.5 million in years 2006 through 2010, $594 million in 2011 and $1,727 million in 2012, maturing in October 2012. On October 5, 2005, we borrowed $2,850 million under the Facilities ($50 million on the revolving credit facility, $350 million on the term loan A and $2,450 million on term loan B), and used these borrowings, along with available cash of $252 million, to purchase DVA Renal Healthcare and pay related bank fees and expenses of approximately $47 million and to pay fees and expenses in connection with terminating our then existing credit facility. On October 7, 2005, we repaid the $50 million of the revolving credit facility with proceeds from the sale of the divested centers. On March 22, 2005, we issued $500 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015 and incurred related deferred financing costs of $28.6 million. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, and require semi annual interest payments. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. We used the net proceeds of $1,323 million along with available cash of $46 million to repay all outstanding amounts under the term loan portions of our then existing credit facilities, including accrued interest. In conjunction with the repayment and extinguishment of our prior credit facilities during 2005, we wrote off deferred financing costs of $8.2 million and reclassified into net income $8.1 million of swap valuation gains that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. These gains represented the accumulated fair value of several interest rate swap instruments that became ineffective as cash flow hedges as a result of the repayment of our prior credit facilities. In addition we recorded a net loss of $2.1 million related to changes in fair values of these swaps that were not effective as interest rate hedges until they were redesignated in the second quarter of 2005. Portions of our various interest rate swap agreements that were previously designated and expected to be effective as forward cash flow hedges became ineffective as a result of us not having any variable rate LIBOR based interest payments during a portion of 2005. This resulted in a net charge of $1.7 million to swap valuation gains, which includes the $1.5 million discussed below as well as a reclassification into income of $2.0 million of swap valuation losses that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. The swap payment periods 41 Table of Contents that began after October 2005 were highly effective cash flow hedges with gains or losses from changes in their fair values reported in other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2005, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1,580 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.2675%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 6.1%, which included the term loan B margin of 2.25%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2005, we incurred net cash obligations of approximately $1.8 million from these swaps, $0.3 million of which is included in debt expense and $1.5 million of which is included in swap valuation gains. As of December 31, 2005, the total fair value of these swaps was an asset of approximately $30.8 million. Also during 2005, we recorded $16.8 million, net of tax, of additional comprehensive income for the changes in fair value of the effective portions of these swaps. At December 31, 2005, our overall credit facility average effective interest rate was 6.62%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.74%. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 55% of our variable rate debt and approximately 70% of our total debt economically fixed. 2004 capital structure changes. In the third quarter of 2004, we amended our then existing credit facilities in order to modify certain restricted payment covenants principally for acquisitions and share repurchases and we extended the maturity of the then existing term loan B until June 30, 2010. We also borrowed an additional $250 million under a new term loan C principally to fund potential acquisitions and share repurchases. The Term Loan C interest rate was LIBOR plus 1.75% for an overall effective rate of 4.16% at December 31, 2004. Under the previously announced Board authorization for share repurchases, we repurchased a total of 3,350,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $28.82 per share during 2004. On November 2, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $200 million of our common stock, from time to time, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The total outstanding Board authorizations for share repurchases are now approximately $249 million. In the first quarter of 2004, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate of 3.08%, plus the Term Loan B margin of 2.00%, for an overall effective rate of 5.08% as of December 31, 2004. The total amortizing notional amount of the swap was $135 million matched with the Term Loan B outstanding debt. The agreement expires in January 2009 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2004, the notional amount of this swap was $135 million and its fair value was an asset of $1.7 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $1.1 million, net of tax. In the third quarter of 2004, we entered into another interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate of 3.64%, plus the Term Loan C margin of 1.75%, for an overall effective rate of 5.39% as of December 31, 2004. The total $75 million non amortizing notional amount of the swap was matched with the Term Loan C outstanding debt. The agreement expires in August 2008 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2004 the fair value of the swap was an asset of $0.1 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $0.06 million, net of tax. As of December 31, 2004, we maintained three interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $345 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 3.64%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.27%, which includes the term loan B margin of 2.00% and a term loan C margin of 1.75%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 and 2009 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2004, we 42 Table of Contents incurred net cash obligations of $5.3 million from these swaps which is included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2004, the fair value of these swaps was an asset of $2.4 million resulting in additional comprehensive income during the year of $3.9 million before tax. On December 10, 2004 we entered into two forward interest rate swap agreements that will have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate at 3.875% effective July 1, 2005. The total amortizing notional amount of these two swaps is $800 million and both expire in January 2010 and require quarterly interest payments that began in October 2005. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate notional amount of these swaps was $800 million and their fair value was an asset of $0.4 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $0.2 million, net of tax. As a result of our swap agreements, over 80% of our outstanding variable rate debt was economically fixed as of December 31, 2004. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers, in the form of put provisions in joint venture agreements, which are exercisable at the third party owners future discretion. These put provisions, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the equity interest put to us. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several third party centers including minority owned centers and centers and clinics that we operate under administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2005 (in millions): Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 71 $ 143 $ 199 $ 3,737 $ 4,150 Interest payments on senior and senior subordinated notes 95 190 190 360 835 Capital lease obligations 1 3 1 2 7 Operating leases 137 236 178 267 818 $ 304 $ 572 $ 568 $ 4,366 $ 5,810 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 48 $ 48 Acquisition of dialysis centers 105 27 30 17 179 Working capital advances to third parties under administrative services agreements 15 15 $ 168 $ 27 $ 30 $ 17 $ 242 Not included above are interest payments related to our credit facilities. Our credit facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus margins ranging from 1.50% and 2.25% and are adjustable depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2005 our credit facilities had a combined effective interest rate of 6.62%. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific payment period tranches within each Term Loan. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of principal payments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no prepayments on our credit facilities during 2006 and no changes in the effective interest rate, approximately $182 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2006. 43 Table of Contents In addition to the above commitments, we have an agreement with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment over the next ten years, in accordance with the Alliance and Product Supply Agreement that we entered into in conjunction with our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. Our total expenditures on such items has been approximately 8% of our total operating costs. The actual amount of purchases in future years under the Alliance and Product Supply Agreement will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating and capital requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers and Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. See Note 3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the valuation of this commitment. Contingencies Our revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements; and (5) claims for refunds from private payors. On March 4, 2005, we received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. The subpoena requires production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including documents related to, among other things, pharmaceutical and other services provided to patients, relationships with pharmaceutical companies, financial relationships with physicians and joint ventures. The subpoena covers the period from December 1, 1996 through the present. The subject matter of this subpoena significantly overlaps with the subject matter of the investigation being conducted by the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. We have met with representatives of the government to discuss the scope of the subpoena and are in the process of producing responsive documents. In October 2005, we received a request for additional documents related to specific medical director and joint venture arrangements. In February 2006, we received an additional subpoena for documents, including certain patient records, relating to the administration and billing of EPO. We intend to continue to cooperate with the governments investigation. The subpoenas have been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time, although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved. Compliance with the subpoenas will continue to require management attention and legal expense. In addition, criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. On October 25, 2004, we received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys office for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. The subpoena covers the period from 1996 to present and requires the production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including DaVita Laboratory Services. The subpoena also includes specific requests for documents relating to testing for parathyroid hormone levels or PTH, and to products relating to vitamin D therapies. We believe that the subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena, including Fresenius Medical Group, Renal Care Group and our recently acquired subsidiary, DVA Renal Healthcare. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us or DVA Renal Healthcare at this time, although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved. Compliance with the subpoenas will continue to require management attention and legal expense. In addition, criminal proceedings may be initiated against us or DVA Renal Healthcare in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and DVA Renal Healthcare, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. In February 2001, the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of our historical 44 Table of Contents practices, including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians. We cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the United States Attorneys Office. In May 2002, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office and the Philadelphia office of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG. The subpoena requires an update to the information we provided in our response to the February 2001 request, and also seeks a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services, as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The subpoena covers the period from May 1996 to May 2002. We have provided the documents requested and continue to cooperate with the United States Attorneys Office and the OIG in its investigation. If this review proceeds, the government could expand its areas of concern. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time, although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We have received several informal inquiries from representatives of the New York Attorney Generals Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, or MFCU, regarding certain aspects of the EPO practices taking place at facilities managed by us in New York. We are cooperating with the MFCUs informal inquiries and have provided documents and information to the MFCU. To the best of our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us and the MFCU has not indicated an intention to do so, although we cannot predict whether we will receive further inquiries or whether or when proceedings might be initiated. In June 2004, DVA Renal Healthcare was served with a complaint filed in the Superior Court of California by one of its former employees that worked for its California acute services program. The complaint, which is styled as a class action, alleges, among other things, that DVA Renal Healthcare failed to provide overtime wages, defined rest periods and meal periods, or compensation in lieu of such provisions and failed to comply with certain other California labor code requirements. We are evaluating the claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the matter. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot estimate the range of damages, if any. On August 8, 2005, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against Gambro AB, DVA Renal Healthcare and related entities. The plaintiff seeks to bring its claims as a class action on behalf of itself and all entities that paid any of the defendants for health care goods and services from on or about January 1991 through at least December 2004. The complaint alleges, among other things, damages resulting from facts and circumstances underlying DVA Renal Healthcares December 2004 settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States Government. We are investigating these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the matter. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot estimate the range of damages, if any. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including from time to time, contractual disputes and professional and general liability claims. We may also be subject to additional claims by commercial payors and other third parties relating to billing practices and other matters covered by the DVA Renal Healthcare settlement agreement with the Department of Justice. We believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information 45 Table of Contents available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts, impairments of long lived assets, variable compensation accruals, accounting for income taxes and purchase accounting valuation estimates, are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize for a reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the more than 500 commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g. 80% for Medicare patients) and b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g. Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 96,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. Our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk is generally expected to be within 1% of total revenue, which can represent as much as 5% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as applicable. Impairment reviews are performed whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill. 46 Table of Contents Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, awards and benefit plan contributions, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. The valuation of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired or assumed in connection with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition required numerous assessments and assumptions, including those concerning dialysis industry trends, our companys business strategies and plans, the strategies of present or potential competitors, the quality of our continuing relationships with physicians and teammates and the likely effects of changes in those relationships, and other competitive and market conditions including those that involve dialysis product suppliers. These assumptions include expected outcomes under different acquisition agreement terms, and as a result, involve estimates of which the ultimate accuracy will never be known. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Long lived tangible and intangible assets will be subject to our regular ongoing impairment assessments. Significant new accounting standards Effective January 1, 2006 we adopted SFAS Statement No. 123R, Share Based Payment, that amended FASB Statements No. 123 and 95 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. This standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, such as stock options, based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize such cost over the requisite period during which an employee provides service. The grant date fair value will be determined using option pricing models adjusted for unique characteristics of the equity instruments. The standard also addresses the accounting for transactions that involve the creation of a liability in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of its equity instruments or that may be settled through the issuance of such equity instruments. The standard does not change the accounting for transactions of equity instruments issued for services to non employees or the accounting for employee stock ownership plans. The standard also requires that the tax benefits realized from stock option exercises in excess of the stock based compensation expenses recognizable for financial statement purposes be reported as a cash flows from financing activities rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required. This would reduce net operating cash flows 47 Table of Contents and increase net financing cash flows upon adoption. We currently expect that our pretax stock option expense will be in the range of $20 million to $30 million, significantly dependent on the timing and amounts of grants in 2006, as well as the Companys stock price at those future dates. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2005. The variable rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of 2005 including the economic effects of our swap agreements. These rates are based on LIBOR plus margins based upon performance and leverage criteria plus the economic impact from the swap agreements. The margins currently in effect range from 2.00% to 2.25%. For our interest rate swap agreements, the table below presents the notional amounts by contract maturity date and the related interest rate terms of the agreements (to pay fixed rates, and to receive LIBOR). Expected maturity date Total Fair Value Average interest rate 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 10 $ 3 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1,352 $ 1,368 $ 1,387 6.98% Variable rate $ 62 $ 64 $ 78 $ 86 $ 112 $ 2,387 $ 2,789 $ 2,789 6.62% Notionalamount Contract maturity date Pay fixed Receivevariable Fairvalue 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 (dollars in millions) Swaps: Pay fixed swaps $ 1,580 $ 240 $ 372 $ 378 $ 401 $ 189 3.08% to 4.2675% LIBOR $ 30.8 As of December 31, 2005, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1,580 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.2675% for an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 6.1%, which included the term loan B margin of 2.25%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2005, we incurred net cash obligations of approximately $1.8 million from these swaps, $0.3 million of which is included in debt expense and $1.5 million of which is included in swap valuation gains. As of December 31, 2005, the total fair value of these swaps was an asset of approximately $30.8 million. Also during 2005, we recorded $16.8 million, net of tax, of additional comprehensive income for the changes in fair value of the effective portions of these swaps. In conjunction with the repayment and extinguishment of our prior credit facilities during 2005, we reclassified into net income $8.1 million of swap valuation gains that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. These gains represented the accumulated fair value of several interest rate swap instruments that became ineffective as cash flow hedges as a result of the repayment of our prior credit facilities. In addition we recorded a net loss of $2.1 million related to changes in fair values of these swaps that were not effective as interest rate hedges until they were redesignated in the second quarter of 2005. Portions of our various interest rate swap agreements that were previously designated and expected to be effective as forward cash flow hedges became ineffective as a result of us not having any variable rate LIBOR based interest payments during a portion of 2005. This resulted in a net charge of $1.7 million to swap valuation gains, which includes the $1.5 million discussed above as well as a reclassification into income of $2.0 million of swap valuation losses that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. The swap payment periods 48 Table of Contents that began after October 2005 were highly effective as cash flow hedges with gains or losses from changes in their fair values reported in other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2005, our overall credit facility average effective interest rate was 6.62%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.74%. As a result of all of our swap agreements, we had over 55% of our outstanding variable rate debt economically fixed and approximately 70% of our total debt economically fixed as of December 31, 2005. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $3.2 million, $5.9 million, and $6.5 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk.

(3) The swap valuation net gains of $4,548 in 2005, represented the accumulated fair value on several swap instruments that were ineffective as cash flow hedges, as a result of the repayment of our credit facilities, as well as changes in the fair values of these swaps until they were redesignated, and represent changes in the fair value of the swaps during periods in which there was no matching variable rate LIBOR based interest payments. (4) Refinancing charges of $8,170 in 2005 represented the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the extinguishment of our prior credit facility. Refinancing charges of $26,501 in 2003 represented the consideration paid to redeem the $125,000 5 5/8% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 and the $345,000 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 in excess of book value, the write off of related deferred financing costs and other financing fees associated with the amendment of the prior credit facility. Refinancing charges of $48,930 in 2002 represented the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the retirement of the $225,000 outstanding 9 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011. Refinancing gains of $1,629 in 2001 related to the write off of deferred financing costs offset by accelerated swap liquidation gains from debt refinancing. (5) During 2005, we divested a total of 71 outpatient dialysis centers in conjunction with a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission on October 4, 2005 in order for us to complete the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. In addition, we completed the sale of three additional centers that were previously pending state regulatory approval in January 2006. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested and held for sale centers are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. (6) All share and per share data for all periods presented prior to 2005 have been adjusted to retroactively reflect the effects of a 3 for 2 stock split that occurred in the second quarter of 2004. (7) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed by dividing earnings by fixed charges. Earnings for this purpose is defined as pretax income from continuing operations adjusted by adding back fixed charges expensed during the period. Fixed charges include debt expense (interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs), the estimated interest component of rental expense on operating leases, and capitalized interest. (8) Share repurchases consisted of 3,350,100 shares of common stock for $96,540 in 2004, 5,162,850 shares of common stock for $107,162 in 2003, 40,991,216 shares of common stock for $642,171 in 2002 and 1,333,050 shares of common stock for $20,360 in 2001. Debt of $124,700 and $526 was converted into 7,302,528 and 24,045 shares of common stock in 2003.

We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,233 outpatient dialysis centers and 795 hospitals, serving approximately 96,000 patients. In October 2005, we acquired DVA Renal Healthcare, Inc. (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare, Inc.), one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, for approximately $3.06 billion, subject to a tax basis step up adjustment, and entered into a 10 year Alliance and Product Supply Agreement with Gambro valued as a $162 million intangible liability. At the time of the acquisition, DVA Renal Healthcare was operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results effective October 1, 2005. In accordance with a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission on October 4, 2005, we were required to divest a total of 69 outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements in order for us to complete the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. In 2005, we divested a total of 71 centers and terminated the two management services agreements. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, we completed the sale of three additional centers that were previously pending state regulatory approval. We received total cash consideration of approximately $330 million for all of the centers divested and used approximately $13 million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture, to distribute a minority owners share of the sale proceeds, and to pay related transaction costs. We anticipate paying related income taxes of approximately 32 Table of Contents $90 million. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers and its one management services agreement are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Our stated mission is to be the provider, employer and partner of choice. We believe our attention to these three areas our patients, our teammates, and our business partners represent the major drivers of our long term success, aside from external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes have improved over each of the past three years, and we ended 2005 with the best clinical outcomes that we have ever achieved. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. Over the past several years we have achieved significant reductions in teammate turnover, which has been a major contributor to our performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. We are pleased with the overall clinical, operating and financial performance levels achieved over the past three years. Although our business has areas of significant potential exposure, as delineated in the risk factors in Item 1A, under the heading Risk Factors, our operating results over the past three years have not been significantly adversely affected by these risk factors, although we cannot provide any assurance that they will not have an impact in the future. Our operations represent a single reporting segment, with more than 95% of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis services, of which 85% represents outpatient hemodialysis services in 1,195 centers that are wholly owned or majority owned. Other direct dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our center operations, are peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services. The principal drivers of our revenue are a) the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week, and b) average treatment revenue. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our pace of opening and acquiring new centers. The number of dialysis treatments increased approximately 36% in 2005 as compared to 2004 and approximately 11% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare accounted for approximately 23% of treatment volume growth for 2005, and represented approximately 44% of the total treatments in the fourth quarter of 2005. Approximately 8% of the increase in the number of treatments in 2005 resulted from routine acquisitions and approximately 5% was due to increased treatments in existing centers. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 6% of our 2004 year over year treatment volume growth, with the remaining 5% attributable to increased treatments in existing centers. Average revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, and our dialysis services charge capture, billing and collecting operations performance. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are more than double Medicare and Medicaid payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment. Approximately 87% of our patients are currently covered under government programs (principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare assigned HMO plans). The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare did not materially affect this patient mix percentage. 33 Table of Contents Approximately 65% of our total dialysis revenue is from government based programs. Government payment rates are principally determined by federal (Medicare) and state (Medicaid) policy. These payment rates have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of being reduced. Medicare revenues represent approximately 50% of our dialysis revenue. Cumulative net increases in Medicare payment rates from 1990 through 2005 total approximately 5%. There were no Medicare payment rate increases for 2003 and 2004. A 1.6% increase was effective on January 1, 2005, however this increase was more than offset by other structural changes to Medicare dialysis payment rates that also became effective January 1, 2005. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, CMS implemented a 1.6% increase. Medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures. Approximately 35% of our dialysis revenue is from commercial insurance and managed care plans. Commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are at contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Over the past three years we have been successful in maintaining relatively stable average payment rates in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases, although we expect continued pressure on commercial payment rates. Approximately 35% of our dialysis revenue has been associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for approximately 25% of our dialysis revenue. Therefore changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, and pharmaceutical intensities significantly influence our revenue levels. Such changes, driven by physician practice patterns and protocols focused on improving clinical outcomes, accounted for a significant portion of the increase in average revenue per treatment in 2004. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services charge capture, billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past three years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduce our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. We are in the process of upgrading our billing and collections systems as we integrate our systems with DVA Renal Healthcares systems which may impact our collections performance. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis revenue per treatment for continuing operations was $313, $313 and $305 for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The revenue per treatment averages for continuing operations for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2005, prior to the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, were approximately $317 and $314 per treatment, respectively. Principal factors affecting our average revenue per treatment were increases in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue), changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial contract negotiations, together with a relatively stable mix of commercial patients and commercial rates. The combined average revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter 2005, including DVA Renal Healthcares results from October 1, 2005, was $311 per treatment. The decrease in average revenue per treatment in the fourth quarter reflects the effect of lower average revenue per treatment attributable to the DVA Renal Healthcare centers and a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals in the quarter. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future. Additionally, the integration process for the DVA Renal Healthcare billing system could adversely affect our collections through the two to three year transition period. The principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also 34 Table of Contents represent significant cost changes such as increased insurance costs experienced in 2004. Our average clinical hours per treatment have improved over the past three years primarily because of reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in 2004 and 2005, and federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. Labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends. For the past three years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors. We expect relatively stable pricing through 2006, however, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO includes volume discount and other thresholds which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to meet those thresholds. Our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare did not have a significant impact on our overall patient costs on a per treatment basis in the fourth quarter of 2005. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenues over the past three years. However, this reflects substantial increases in spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes, legal and other professional fees, and expanding support functions. We expect that these higher levels of general and administrative expenses will be generally maintained or increased to support our long term initiatives and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Approximately $11 million in integration costs associated with the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare were incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005, and we currently expect integration costs to be in the range of $50 million in 2006, exclusive of capital asset expenditures. Although other revenues represent less than 5% of total revenues, successful resolutions of disputed Medicare billings at our Florida lab resulted in recoveries related to prior years services being recognized as current period revenue and operating income of approximately $4 million, $8 million, and $24 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Outlook for 2006. We are currently targeting operating income in 2006 to be in the $630 $700 million range before the impact of FASB No. 123R related to stock based compensation expense. We currently expect that our pre tax stock option expense will be in the range of $20 million to $30 million, significantly dependent on the timing and amounts of grants in 2006, as well as the Companys stock price at those future dates. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients, possible reductions in private and government payment rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with our physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the ongoing review by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the OIG, the subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and the subpoenas from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, DVA Renal Healthcares compliance with its corporate integrity agreement, and our ability to complete and integrate acquisitions of businesses, including the integration of DVA Renal Healthcare. You should read Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 32 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. 35 Table of Contents Results of operations Following is a summary of operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. Prior year operating results have been restated to reflect only continuing operations. Year ended December 31, Continuing Operations 2005 2004 2003 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, except per treatment data) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 2,970 100 % $ 2,169 100 % $ 1,895 100 % Prior years services laboratory 4 8 24 2,974 2,177 1,919 Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 2,036 69 % 1,470 68 % 1,288 68 % General and administrative 272 9 % 192 9 % 160 8 % Depreciation and amortization 117 4 % 83 4 % 71 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 62 2 % 39 2 % 34 2 % Minority interests and equity income, net 22 12 7 Total operating expenses and charges 2,509 85 % 1,796 83 % 1,560 82 % Operating income including prior years recoveries (i.e., including amounts in italics) $ 465 $ 381 $ 360 Dialysis treatments 9,044,966 6,654,069 6,015,201 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 28,898 21,225 19,224 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 313 $ 313 $ 305 The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results from October 1, 2005. Our operating income margins, excluding recoveries for prior years lab services, declined from 17.2% in 2004 to 15.5% in 2005, primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs, and the effects of the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. The average revenue per treatment rates attributable to DVA Renal Healthcare centers are lower than our average rates before the acquisition, and we incurred approximately $11 million in integration costs in the fourth quarter of 2005. Our combined operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2005 was approximately 14%. Net operating revenues Operating revenues for current period services increased 37% in 2005 compared to 2004 and 14% in 2004 compared to 2003. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare in the fourth quarter of 2005 accounted for approximately 22% of the increase in 2005, approximately 12% was due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments with the balance of approximately 3% due to additional increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment and additional lab, management fees and ancillary revenue. Approximately 11% of the increase in 2004 was due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments with the balance attributable to increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment. Dialysis revenues represented approximately 95%, 96% and 96% of net operating revenues in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Lab and other ancillary services and management fee income accounted for the balance of revenues. Dialysis revenues. We generate approximately 85%, 9% and 6% of our total dialysis revenue from outpatient hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and home based dialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis, respectively. Major components of dialysis revenues include the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents approximately 35% of total dialysis revenues. Approximately 65% of our total dialysis revenues are from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage Plans, representing approximately 87% of our total patients. Our 36 Table of Contents non government payors consist principally of commercial insurance plans, including more than 500 with whom we have contracted rates. Additionally, we have approximately 1,500 single patient agreements establishing our payment rates for patients not covered by other contracts. Approximately 10 percent of our revenue is associated with non contracted commercial plans. Less than one percent of our dialysis services payments were received directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounts for more than 5% of total dialysis revenues. On average we are paid at more than double the Medicare or Medicaid rates for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans. Patients covered by employer group health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As of year end 2005, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $134 and $159 per treatment, or an overall average of $145 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. The majority of our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. The commercial payment rates are under continuous downward pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers, and may be further negatively impacted by the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. Our year over year treatment volume growth was as follows: 2005 2004 Treatment growth related to: Existing and newly opened centers 5.4 % 5.8 % Routine center acquisitions 7.5 % 5.0 % DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition effective 10/1/05 23.0 % Total treatment growth 35.9 % 10.8 % The average dialysis revenue per treatment for continuing operations was $313, $313 and $305 for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The revenue per treatment averages for continuing operations for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2005, prior to the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, were approximately $317 and $314 per treatment, respectively. Principal factors affecting our average revenue per treatment were increases in our standard fee schedules (impacting non contracted commercial revenue), changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial contract negotiations, together with a relatively stable mix of commercial patients and commercial rates. The combined average revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter 2005, including DVA Renal Healthcares results effective October 1 2005, was $311 per treatment. The decrease in average revenue per treatment in the fourth quarter reflects a lower average revenue per treatment attributable to the DVA Renal Healthcare centers and a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals in the quarter. DVA Renal Healthcares percentage mix of government and non government patients is similar to our historical percentages. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future. Additionally, the integration process for the DVA Renal Healthcare billing system could adversely affect our collections through the two to three year transition period. Lab and other services. Lab and other services represented approximately 4% of net operating revenues for 2005 and 2004. A third party carrier review of Medicare claims associated with our Florida based laboratory was initiated in 1998. No Medicare payments were received for our lab services from the second quarter of 1998 until the third quarter of 2002 while we were appealing the Medicare payment withholds. Following a favorable administrative law judge ruling in June 2002, payments for the earliest review periods, as well as for current lab services, were received in the third quarter of 2002. Favorable rulings were subsequently received for the other review periods, resulting in additional recoveries. Prior year recoveries include approximately $59 million received in 2002, $24 million in 2003, $8 million in 2004, and $4 million in 2005. As of December 31, 2005, there are no significant unresolved Medicare lab billing issues. 37 Table of Contents Management fee income. Management fee income represented less than 1% of net operating revenues for 2005 and 2004. We operated or provided administrative services to 38 and 34 third party or minority owned dialysis centers as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our management fees are principally based on a percentage of the revenue of the managed operations, or based upon a percentage of operating income. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and facility costs. As a percentage of current period operating revenues, patient care costs were approximately 69% for 2005, 68% for 2004 and 68% for 2003. On a per treatment basis, patient care costs increased year over year approximately $4 and $7 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2005 was principally due to higher labor and benefit costs, and to a lesser extent medical supply costs. The overall average patient care costs per treatment in the fourth quarter of 2005 were $228 or approximately $4 higher than the full year average. This increase in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by higher pharmaceutical and other medical supply costs, and reflects the blended average of the combined operations after the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to higher labor costs and increases in the levels of revenue generating physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The higher labor costs reflect rising labor rates and the effect of the increase in the number of newly opened centers, which are not yet at normal productivity levels. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and include expenses for corporate and divisional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions, and regulatory compliance oversight. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of current period operating revenues were 9.2%, 8.9%, and 8.4% in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expense for 2005 was primarily due to infrastructure costs for expanding business operations, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives and government investigations, higher labor costs, and integration costs associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. The increase in 2004 principally consisted of higher labor costs, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives, and increases in support infrastructure for corporate initiatives and business expansion. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was approximately 4% of current period operating revenues for each of the past three years, and for the fourth quarter of 2005. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding valuations of intangibles acquired or assumed in connection with the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. Provision for uncollectible accounts. As a result of the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition and the higher historical provision rate for DVA Renal Healthcare, the post acquisition average provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2005. The provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately 2.1% of current period operating revenues for the full year 2005, and 1.8% for 2004 and 2003. Minority interests and equity income, net. Minority interests net of equity income increased in 2005 by approximately $10 million over 2004 due to an increase in new centers having minority partners as well as growth in the earnings of our joint ventures. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, and investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. 38 Table of Contents Other income Other income, which was a net of approximately $9 million, $4 million, and $3 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, consisted principally of interest income. Debt expense and refinancing charges Debt expense for 2005, 2004, and 2003 consisted of interest expense of approximately $134 million, $50 million, and $64 million, respectively, and amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $5 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004, and $3 million in 2003. The increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to borrowings under our new credit facility in connection with the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, increases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates and issuance of our new senior and senior subordinated notes that have average fixed interest rates of approximately 7.0%, offset by changes in our LIBOR based receipts from swap settlements. The decrease in interest expense in 2004 as compared to 2003 was due to changes in the mix of our debt instruments. For most of 2003 we incurred higher interest rates on our senior subordinated notes, which were paid off in the second half of 2003 and replaced with lower interest rate borrowings from our prior credit facility. This decrease was partially offset by the effect on interest rates from our swap agreements and higher average debt balances. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2005 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 37.4%, compared with 38.6%, and 39.0% in 2004 and 2003. The lower effective tax rates for 2005 and 2004 were primarily due to lower state income taxes and tax valuation allowance adjustments. We currently project that the effective income tax rate for 2006 will be in the range of 39% to 40%. The higher projected rate for 2006 is principally due to favorable tax valuation adjustments in 2005, higher effective state income tax rates, and lower levels of tax exempt interest income. Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2005 and 2004 represented approximately 71 and 69 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt provision. The relative increase in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2005 reflects an increased level of delayed billings and delayed cash collections associated with the Medicare certification process for newly opened and acquired centers, as well as general collection patterns. As of December 31, 2005 approximately $47 million in unreserved accounts receivable, which represented less than 6% of our total unreserved accounts receivable balance, were more than six months old. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than one half of 1% of our treatments are classified as patient pay. Virtually all revenue realized is from government and non government third party payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2005, other than the standard monthly processing, consisted of approximately $24 million associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other accounts receivable. Our Medicare bad debt claims are typically not paid to us until the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims, and such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements except for potentially limiting the collectibility of Medicare bad debt claims. DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition On October 5, 2005, we completed our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, Inc. (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare, Inc.) from Gambro, Inc. under a Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 6, 2004, for $3.06 billion, subject to a tax basis step up election. DVA Renal Healthcare was one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers serving approximately 43,000 39 Table of Contents patients and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion. We have incurred approximately $29 million in acquisition related costs through December 31, 2005. If we make an election pursuant to section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code as permitted under the Stock Purchase Agreement, we would be required to make an additional cash payment to Gambro Inc., which we currently estimate to be approximately $170 million. This election would result in tax benefits realizable over 15 years. In conjunction with the acquisition, we entered into an Alliance and Product Supply Agreement (the Supply Agreement) with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. for a minimum of 10 years. The Supply Agreement has an initial term of seven years and will automatically renew for three additional one year periods if we have not negotiated the terms of an extension during the initial term period. Under the Supply Agreement we are committed to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices. For the year ended December 31, 2005 our total expenditures on such items was approximately 8% of our total operating costs. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Divestitures per Federal Trade Commission Consent Order. As a condition of completing the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, we were required by the Federal Trade Commission to divest a total of 69 outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements. On October 6, 2005, DaVita and DVA Renal Healthcare completed the sale of 70 outpatient renal dialysis centers to Renal Advantage Inc., formerly known as RenalAmerica, Inc. and also completed the sale of one other center to a separate physician group, and terminated the two management services agreements. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, we completed the sale of three additional centers to Renal Advantage Inc. that were previously pending state regulatory approval in Illinois. We received total cash consideration of approximately $330 million for all of the centers divested and used approximately $13 million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture, to distribute a minority owners share of the sale proceeds, and to pay related transaction costs. We anticipate paying related income taxes of approximately $90 million on these divestitures. As part of this transaction, Renal Advantage assumed specific liabilities related to the centers and all other liabilities were retained by the Company. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers are accounted for as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2005 our cash balance was $432 million and we had undrawn credit facilities totaling $250 million, of which approximately $50 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations over the next twelve months. Cash flow from operations during 2005 amounted to $486 million, compared with $420 million, including after tax Medicare lab recoveries of $17 million for 2004. Non operating cash outflows in 2005 included $161 million for capital asset expenditures, including $93 million for new center developments and $3,202 million for acquisitions. We also received in 2005 approximately $298 million from the sale of discontinued operations. Non operating cash outflows in 2004 included $128 million for capital asset expenditures, including $83 million for new center developments, $266 million for acquisitions and $97 million for stock repurchases. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare in the fourth quarter of 2005 resulted in the net addition of 492 dialysis centers after related divestitures. We acquired 54 other dialysis centers and opened 46 new dialysis centers during 2005. During 2004, we acquired a total of 51 dialysis centers and opened 44 new dialysis centers. The largest acquisition during 2004 was the purchase of the common stock of Physicians Dialysis, Inc. (PDI), for approximately $150 million, which added 24 centers. We currently expect to spend approximately $125 million to $135 million for general capital asset expenditures in 2006, and approximately $130 million to $150 million for new center development and center acquisitions. Our current projections include opening approximately 40 new centers in 2006. We expect to 40 Table of Contents generate approximately $410 million to $480 million of operating cash flow in 2006, before capital expenditures and acquisitions. 2005 capital structure changes. On October 5, 2005, we entered into a new credit agreement allowing for borrowings of up to $3.05 billion. The facilities under the credit agreement consist of a $250 million six year revolving credit facility, a $350 million six year term loan A facility and a $2,450 million seven year term loan B facility (the Facilities). Existing borrowings under the Facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus margins initially ranging from 2.00% to 2.25%. The margins are subject to adjustment depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios and can range from 1.50% to 2.25% for the revolving credit facility and the term loan A, and 2.00% to 2.25% for the term loan B. The Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets. The credit agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and requires compliance with financial covenants, including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio that determine the interest rate margins described above. The aggregate amount of the Facilities may be increased by up to $500 million as long as no default exists or would result from such increase and we remain in compliance with the financial covenants after such increase. Such additional loans would be on substantially the same terms as the original borrowings under the Facilities. The term loan A requires annual principal payments of $35 million in 2006, $39.4 million in 2007, $52.5 million in 2008, $61.2 million in 2009, $87.5 million in 2010, and $65.6 in 2011, maturing in October 2011. The term loan B requires annual principal payments of $24.5 million in years 2006 through 2010, $594 million in 2011 and $1,727 million in 2012, maturing in October 2012. On October 5, 2005, we borrowed $2,850 million under the Facilities ($50 million on the revolving credit facility, $350 million on the term loan A and $2,450 million on term loan B), and used these borrowings, along with available cash of $252 million, to purchase DVA Renal Healthcare and pay related bank fees and expenses of approximately $47 million and to pay fees and expenses in connection with terminating our then existing credit facility. On October 7, 2005, we repaid the $50 million of the revolving credit facility with proceeds from the sale of the divested centers. On March 22, 2005, we issued $500 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015 and incurred related deferred financing costs of $28.6 million. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, and require semi annual interest payments. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. We used the net proceeds of $1,323 million along with available cash of $46 million to repay all outstanding amounts under the term loan portions of our then existing credit facilities, including accrued interest. In conjunction with the repayment and extinguishment of our prior credit facilities during 2005, we wrote off deferred financing costs of $8.2 million and reclassified into net income $8.1 million of swap valuation gains that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. These gains represented the accumulated fair value of several interest rate swap instruments that became ineffective as cash flow hedges as a result of the repayment of our prior credit facilities. In addition we recorded a net loss of $2.1 million related to changes in fair values of these swaps that were not effective as interest rate hedges until they were redesignated in the second quarter of 2005. Portions of our various interest rate swap agreements that were previously designated and expected to be effective as forward cash flow hedges became ineffective as a result of us not having any variable rate LIBOR based interest payments during a portion of 2005. This resulted in a net charge of $1.7 million to swap valuation gains, which includes the $1.5 million discussed below as well as a reclassification into income of $2.0 million of swap valuation losses that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. The swap payment periods 41 Table of Contents that began after October 2005 were highly effective cash flow hedges with gains or losses from changes in their fair values reported in other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2005, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1,580 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.2675%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 6.1%, which included the term loan B margin of 2.25%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2005, we incurred net cash obligations of approximately $1.8 million from these swaps, $0.3 million of which is included in debt expense and $1.5 million of which is included in swap valuation gains. As of December 31, 2005, the total fair value of these swaps was an asset of approximately $30.8 million. Also during 2005, we recorded $16.8 million, net of tax, of additional comprehensive income for the changes in fair value of the effective portions of these swaps. At December 31, 2005, our overall credit facility average effective interest rate was 6.62%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.74%. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 55% of our variable rate debt and approximately 70% of our total debt economically fixed. 2004 capital structure changes. In the third quarter of 2004, we amended our then existing credit facilities in order to modify certain restricted payment covenants principally for acquisitions and share repurchases and we extended the maturity of the then existing term loan B until June 30, 2010. We also borrowed an additional $250 million under a new term loan C principally to fund potential acquisitions and share repurchases. The Term Loan C interest rate was LIBOR plus 1.75% for an overall effective rate of 4.16% at December 31, 2004. Under the previously announced Board authorization for share repurchases, we repurchased a total of 3,350,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $28.82 per share during 2004. On November 2, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $200 million of our common stock, from time to time, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The total outstanding Board authorizations for share repurchases are now approximately $249 million. In the first quarter of 2004, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate of 3.08%, plus the Term Loan B margin of 2.00%, for an overall effective rate of 5.08% as of December 31, 2004. The total amortizing notional amount of the swap was $135 million matched with the Term Loan B outstanding debt. The agreement expires in January 2009 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2004, the notional amount of this swap was $135 million and its fair value was an asset of $1.7 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $1.1 million, net of tax. In the third quarter of 2004, we entered into another interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate of 3.64%, plus the Term Loan C margin of 1.75%, for an overall effective rate of 5.39% as of December 31, 2004. The total $75 million non amortizing notional amount of the swap was matched with the Term Loan C outstanding debt. The agreement expires in August 2008 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2004 the fair value of the swap was an asset of $0.1 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $0.06 million, net of tax. As of December 31, 2004, we maintained three interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $345 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 3.64%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.27%, which includes the term loan B margin of 2.00% and a term loan C margin of 1.75%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 and 2009 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2004, we 42 Table of Contents incurred net cash obligations of $5.3 million from these swaps which is included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2004, the fair value of these swaps was an asset of $2.4 million resulting in additional comprehensive income during the year of $3.9 million before tax. On December 10, 2004 we entered into two forward interest rate swap agreements that will have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate at 3.875% effective July 1, 2005. The total amortizing notional amount of these two swaps is $800 million and both expire in January 2010 and require quarterly interest payments that began in October 2005. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate notional amount of these swaps was $800 million and their fair value was an asset of $0.4 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $0.2 million, net of tax. As a result of our swap agreements, over 80% of our outstanding variable rate debt was economically fixed as of December 31, 2004. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers, in the form of put provisions in joint venture agreements, which are exercisable at the third party owners future discretion. These put provisions, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the equity interest put to us. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several third party centers including minority owned centers and centers and clinics that we operate under administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2005 (in millions): Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 71 $ 143 $ 199 $ 3,737 $ 4,150 Interest payments on senior and senior subordinated notes 95 190 190 360 835 Capital lease obligations 1 3 1 2 7 Operating leases 137 236 178 267 818 $ 304 $ 572 $ 568 $ 4,366 $ 5,810 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 48 $ 48 Acquisition of dialysis centers 105 27 30 17 179 Working capital advances to third parties under administrative services agreements 15 15 $ 168 $ 27 $ 30 $ 17 $ 242 Not included above are interest payments related to our credit facilities. Our credit facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus margins ranging from 1.50% and 2.25% and are adjustable depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2005 our credit facilities had a combined effective interest rate of 6.62%. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific payment period tranches within each Term Loan. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of principal payments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no prepayments on our credit facilities during 2006 and no changes in the effective interest rate, approximately $182 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2006. 43 Table of Contents In addition to the above commitments, we have an agreement with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment over the next ten years, in accordance with the Alliance and Product Supply Agreement that we entered into in conjunction with our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. Our total expenditures on such items has been approximately 8% of our total operating costs. The actual amount of purchases in future years under the Alliance and Product Supply Agreement will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating and capital requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers and Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. See Note 3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the valuation of this commitment. Contingencies Our revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements; and (5) claims for refunds from private payors. On March 4, 2005, we received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. The subpoena requires production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including documents related to, among other things, pharmaceutical and other services provided to patients, relationships with pharmaceutical companies, financial relationships with physicians and joint ventures. The subpoena covers the period from December 1, 1996 through the present. The subject matter of this subpoena significantly overlaps with the subject matter of the investigation being conducted by the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. We have met with representatives of the government to discuss the scope of the subpoena and are in the process of producing responsive documents. In October 2005, we received a request for additional documents related to specific medical director and joint venture arrangements. In February 2006, we received an additional subpoena for documents, including certain patient records, relating to the administration and billing of EPO. We intend to continue to cooperate with the governments investigation. The subpoenas have been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time, although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved. Compliance with the subpoenas will continue to require management attention and legal expense. In addition, criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. On October 25, 2004, we received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys office for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. The subpoena covers the period from 1996 to present and requires the production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including DaVita Laboratory Services. The subpoena also includes specific requests for documents relating to testing for parathyroid hormone levels or PTH, and to products relating to vitamin D therapies. We believe that the subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena, including Fresenius Medical Group, Renal Care Group and our recently acquired subsidiary, DVA Renal Healthcare. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us or DVA Renal Healthcare at this time, although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved. Compliance with the subpoenas will continue to require management attention and legal expense. In addition, criminal proceedings may be initiated against us or DVA Renal Healthcare in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and DVA Renal Healthcare, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. In February 2001, the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of our historical 44 Table of Contents practices, including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians. We cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the United States Attorneys Office. In May 2002, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office and the Philadelphia office of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG. The subpoena requires an update to the information we provided in our response to the February 2001 request, and also seeks a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services, as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The subpoena covers the period from May 1996 to May 2002. We have provided the documents requested and continue to cooperate with the United States Attorneys Office and the OIG in its investigation. If this review proceeds, the government could expand its areas of concern. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time, although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We have received several informal inquiries from representatives of the New York Attorney Generals Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, or MFCU, regarding certain aspects of the EPO practices taking place at facilities managed by us in New York. We are cooperating with the MFCUs informal inquiries and have provided documents and information to the MFCU. To the best of our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us and the MFCU has not indicated an intention to do so, although we cannot predict whether we will receive further inquiries or whether or when proceedings might be initiated. In June 2004, DVA Renal Healthcare was served with a complaint filed in the Superior Court of California by one of its former employees that worked for its California acute services program. The complaint, which is styled as a class action, alleges, among other things, that DVA Renal Healthcare failed to provide overtime wages, defined rest periods and meal periods, or compensation in lieu of such provisions and failed to comply with certain other California labor code requirements. We are evaluating the claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the matter. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot estimate the range of damages, if any. On August 8, 2005, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against Gambro AB, DVA Renal Healthcare and related entities. The plaintiff seeks to bring its claims as a class action on behalf of itself and all entities that paid any of the defendants for health care goods and services from on or about January 1991 through at least December 2004. The complaint alleges, among other things, damages resulting from facts and circumstances underlying DVA Renal Healthcares December 2004 settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States Government. We are investigating these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the matter. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot estimate the range of damages, if any. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including from time to time, contractual disputes and professional and general liability claims. We may also be subject to additional claims by commercial payors and other third parties relating to billing practices and other matters covered by the DVA Renal Healthcare settlement agreement with the Department of Justice. We believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information 45 Table of Contents available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts, impairments of long lived assets, variable compensation accruals, accounting for income taxes and purchase accounting valuation estimates, are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize for a reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the more than 500 commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g. 80% for Medicare patients) and b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g. Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 96,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. Our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk is generally expected to be within 1% of total revenue, which can represent as much as 5% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as applicable. Impairment reviews are performed whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill. 46 Table of Contents Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, awards and benefit plan contributions, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. The valuation of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired or assumed in connection with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition required numerous assessments and assumptions, including those concerning dialysis industry trends, our companys business strategies and plans, the strategies of present or potential competitors, the quality of our continuing relationships with physicians and teammates and the likely effects of changes in those relationships, and other competitive and market conditions including those that involve dialysis product suppliers. These assumptions include expected outcomes under different acquisition agreement terms, and as a result, involve estimates of which the ultimate accuracy will never be known. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Long lived tangible and intangible assets will be subject to our regular ongoing impairment assessments. Significant new accounting standards Effective January 1, 2006 we adopted SFAS Statement No. 123R, Share Based Payment, that amended FASB Statements No. 123 and 95 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. This standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, such as stock options, based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize such cost over the requisite period during which an employee provides service. The grant date fair value will be determined using option pricing models adjusted for unique characteristics of the equity instruments. The standard also addresses the accounting for transactions that involve the creation of a liability in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of its equity instruments or that may be settled through the issuance of such equity instruments. The standard does not change the accounting for transactions of equity instruments issued for services to non employees or the accounting for employee stock ownership plans. The standard also requires that the tax benefits realized from stock option exercises in excess of the stock based compensation expenses recognizable for financial statement purposes be reported as a cash flows from financing activities rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required. This would reduce net operating cash flows 47 Table of Contents and increase net financing cash flows upon adoption. We currently expect that our pretax stock option expense will be in the range of $20 million to $30 million, significantly dependent on the timing and amounts of grants in 2006, as well as the Companys stock price at those future dates. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2005. The variable rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of 2005 including the economic effects of our swap agreements. These rates are based on LIBOR plus margins based upon performance and leverage criteria plus the economic impact from the swap agreements. The margins currently in effect range from 2.00% to 2.25%. For our interest rate swap agreements, the table below presents the notional amounts by contract maturity date and the related interest rate terms of the agreements (to pay fixed rates, and to receive LIBOR). Expected maturity date Total Fair Value Average interest rate 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 10 $ 3 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1,352 $ 1,368 $ 1,387 6.98% Variable rate $ 62 $ 64 $ 78 $ 86 $ 112 $ 2,387 $ 2,789 $ 2,789 6.62% Notionalamount Contract maturity date Pay fixed Receivevariable Fairvalue 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 (dollars in millions) Swaps: Pay fixed swaps $ 1,580 $ 240 $ 372 $ 378 $ 401 $ 189 3.08% to 4.2675% LIBOR $ 30.8 As of December 31, 2005, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1,580 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.2675% for an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 6.1%, which included the term loan B margin of 2.25%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2005, we incurred net cash obligations of approximately $1.8 million from these swaps, $0.3 million of which is included in debt expense and $1.5 million of which is included in swap valuation gains. As of December 31, 2005, the total fair value of these swaps was an asset of approximately $30.8 million. Also during 2005, we recorded $16.8 million, net of tax, of additional comprehensive income for the changes in fair value of the effective portions of these swaps. In conjunction with the repayment and extinguishment of our prior credit facilities during 2005, we reclassified into net income $8.1 million of swap valuation gains that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. These gains represented the accumulated fair value of several interest rate swap instruments that became ineffective as cash flow hedges as a result of the repayment of our prior credit facilities. In addition we recorded a net loss of $2.1 million related to changes in fair values of these swaps that were not effective as interest rate hedges until they were redesignated in the second quarter of 2005. Portions of our various interest rate swap agreements that were previously designated and expected to be effective as forward cash flow hedges became ineffective as a result of us not having any variable rate LIBOR based interest payments during a portion of 2005. This resulted in a net charge of $1.7 million to swap valuation gains, which includes the $1.5 million discussed above as well as a reclassification into income of $2.0 million of swap valuation losses that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. The swap payment periods 48 Table of Contents that began after October 2005 were highly effective as cash flow hedges with gains or losses from changes in their fair values reported in other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2005, our overall credit facility average effective interest rate was 6.62%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.74%. As a result of all of our swap agreements, we had over 55% of our outstanding variable rate debt economically fixed and approximately 70% of our total debt economically fixed as of December 31, 2005. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $3.2 million, $5.9 million, and $6.5 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk.

We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,233 outpatient dialysis centers and 795 hospitals, serving approximately 96,000 patients. In October 2005, we acquired DVA Renal Healthcare, Inc. (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare, Inc.), one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, for approximately $3.06 billion, subject to a tax basis step up adjustment, and entered into a 10 year Alliance and Product Supply Agreement with Gambro valued as a $162 million intangible liability. At the time of the acquisition, DVA Renal Healthcare was operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results effective October 1, 2005. In accordance with a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission on October 4, 2005, we were required to divest a total of 69 outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements in order for us to complete the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. In 2005, we divested a total of 71 centers and terminated the two management services agreements. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, we completed the sale of three additional centers that were previously pending state regulatory approval. We received total cash consideration of approximately $330 million for all of the centers divested and used approximately $13 million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture, to distribute a minority owners share of the sale proceeds, and to pay related transaction costs. We anticipate paying related income taxes of approximately 32 Table of Contents $90 million. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers and its one management services agreement are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Our stated mission is to be the provider, employer and partner of choice. We believe our attention to these three areas our patients, our teammates, and our business partners represent the major drivers of our long term success, aside from external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes have improved over each of the past three years, and we ended 2005 with the best clinical outcomes that we have ever achieved. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. Over the past several years we have achieved significant reductions in teammate turnover, which has been a major contributor to our performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. We are pleased with the overall clinical, operating and financial performance levels achieved over the past three years. Although our business has areas of significant potential exposure, as delineated in the risk factors in Item 1A, under the heading Risk Factors, our operating results over the past three years have not been significantly adversely affected by these risk factors, although we cannot provide any assurance that they will not have an impact in the future. Our operations represent a single reporting segment, with more than 95% of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis services, of which 85% represents outpatient hemodialysis services in 1,195 centers that are wholly owned or majority owned. Other direct dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our center operations, are peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services. The principal drivers of our revenue are a) the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week, and b) average treatment revenue. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our pace of opening and acquiring new centers. The number of dialysis treatments increased approximately 36% in 2005 as compared to 2004 and approximately 11% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare accounted for approximately 23% of treatment volume growth for 2005, and represented approximately 44% of the total treatments in the fourth quarter of 2005. Approximately 8% of the increase in the number of treatments in 2005 resulted from routine acquisitions and approximately 5% was due to increased treatments in existing centers. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 6% of our 2004 year over year treatment volume growth, with the remaining 5% attributable to increased treatments in existing centers. Average revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, and our dialysis services charge capture, billing and collecting operations performance. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are more than double Medicare and Medicaid payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment. Approximately 87% of our patients are currently covered under government programs (principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare assigned HMO plans). The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare did not materially affect this patient mix percentage. 33 Table of Contents Approximately 65% of our total dialysis revenue is from government based programs. Government payment rates are principally determined by federal (Medicare) and state (Medicaid) policy. These payment rates have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of being reduced. Medicare revenues represent approximately 50% of our dialysis revenue. Cumulative net increases in Medicare payment rates from 1990 through 2005 total approximately 5%. There were no Medicare payment rate increases for 2003 and 2004. A 1.6% increase was effective on January 1, 2005, however this increase was more than offset by other structural changes to Medicare dialysis payment rates that also became effective January 1, 2005. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, CMS implemented a 1.6% increase. Medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures. Approximately 35% of our dialysis revenue is from commercial insurance and managed care plans. Commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are at contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Over the past three years we have been successful in maintaining relatively stable average payment rates in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases, although we expect continued pressure on commercial payment rates. Approximately 35% of our dialysis revenue has been associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for approximately 25% of our dialysis revenue. Therefore changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, and pharmaceutical intensities significantly influence our revenue levels. Such changes, driven by physician practice patterns and protocols focused on improving clinical outcomes, accounted for a significant portion of the increase in average revenue per treatment in 2004. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services charge capture, billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past three years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduce our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. We are in the process of upgrading our billing and collections systems as we integrate our systems with DVA Renal Healthcares systems which may impact our collections performance. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis revenue per treatment for continuing operations was $313, $313 and $305 for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The revenue per treatment averages for continuing operations for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2005, prior to the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, were approximately $317 and $314 per treatment, respectively. Principal factors affecting our average revenue per treatment were increases in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue), changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial contract negotiations, together with a relatively stable mix of commercial patients and commercial rates. The combined average revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter 2005, including DVA Renal Healthcares results from October 1, 2005, was $311 per treatment. The decrease in average revenue per treatment in the fourth quarter reflects the effect of lower average revenue per treatment attributable to the DVA Renal Healthcare centers and a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals in the quarter. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future. Additionally, the integration process for the DVA Renal Healthcare billing system could adversely affect our collections through the two to three year transition period. The principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also 34 Table of Contents represent significant cost changes such as increased insurance costs experienced in 2004. Our average clinical hours per treatment have improved over the past three years primarily because of reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in 2004 and 2005, and federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. Labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends. For the past three years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors. We expect relatively stable pricing through 2006, however, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO includes volume discount and other thresholds which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to meet those thresholds. Our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare did not have a significant impact on our overall patient costs on a per treatment basis in the fourth quarter of 2005. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenues over the past three years. However, this reflects substantial increases in spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes, legal and other professional fees, and expanding support functions. We expect that these higher levels of general and administrative expenses will be generally maintained or increased to support our long term initiatives and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Approximately $11 million in integration costs associated with the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare were incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005, and we currently expect integration costs to be in the range of $50 million in 2006, exclusive of capital asset expenditures. Although other revenues represent less than 5% of total revenues, successful resolutions of disputed Medicare billings at our Florida lab resulted in recoveries related to prior years services being recognized as current period revenue and operating income of approximately $4 million, $8 million, and $24 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Outlook for 2006. We are currently targeting operating income in 2006 to be in the $630 $700 million range before the impact of FASB No. 123R related to stock based compensation expense. We currently expect that our pre tax stock option expense will be in the range of $20 million to $30 million, significantly dependent on the timing and amounts of grants in 2006, as well as the Companys stock price at those future dates. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from PPO and private indemnity patients, possible reductions in private and government payment rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with our physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the ongoing review by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the OIG, the subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and the subpoenas from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, DVA Renal Healthcares compliance with its corporate integrity agreement, and our ability to complete and integrate acquisitions of businesses, including the integration of DVA Renal Healthcare. You should read Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 32 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. 35 Table of Contents Results of operations Following is a summary of operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. Prior year operating results have been restated to reflect only continuing operations. Year ended December 31, Continuing Operations 2005 2004 2003 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, except per treatment data) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 2,970 100 % $ 2,169 100 % $ 1,895 100 % Prior years services laboratory 4 8 24 2,974 2,177 1,919 Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 2,036 69 % 1,470 68 % 1,288 68 % General and administrative 272 9 % 192 9 % 160 8 % Depreciation and amortization 117 4 % 83 4 % 71 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 62 2 % 39 2 % 34 2 % Minority interests and equity income, net 22 12 7 Total operating expenses and charges 2,509 85 % 1,796 83 % 1,560 82 % Operating income including prior years recoveries (i.e., including amounts in italics) $ 465 $ 381 $ 360 Dialysis treatments 9,044,966 6,654,069 6,015,201 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 28,898 21,225 19,224 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 313 $ 313 $ 305 The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results from October 1, 2005. Our operating income margins, excluding recoveries for prior years lab services, declined from 17.2% in 2004 to 15.5% in 2005, primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs, and the effects of the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. The average revenue per treatment rates attributable to DVA Renal Healthcare centers are lower than our average rates before the acquisition, and we incurred approximately $11 million in integration costs in the fourth quarter of 2005. Our combined operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2005 was approximately 14%. Net operating revenues Operating revenues for current period services increased 37% in 2005 compared to 2004 and 14% in 2004 compared to 2003. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare in the fourth quarter of 2005 accounted for approximately 22% of the increase in 2005, approximately 12% was due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments with the balance of approximately 3% due to additional increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment and additional lab, management fees and ancillary revenue. Approximately 11% of the increase in 2004 was due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments with the balance attributable to increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment. Dialysis revenues represented approximately 95%, 96% and 96% of net operating revenues in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Lab and other ancillary services and management fee income accounted for the balance of revenues. Dialysis revenues. We generate approximately 85%, 9% and 6% of our total dialysis revenue from outpatient hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and home based dialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis, respectively. Major components of dialysis revenues include the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents approximately 35% of total dialysis revenues. Approximately 65% of our total dialysis revenues are from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage Plans, representing approximately 87% of our total patients. Our 36 Table of Contents non government payors consist principally of commercial insurance plans, including more than 500 with whom we have contracted rates. Additionally, we have approximately 1,500 single patient agreements establishing our payment rates for patients not covered by other contracts. Approximately 10 percent of our revenue is associated with non contracted commercial plans. Less than one percent of our dialysis services payments were received directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounts for more than 5% of total dialysis revenues. On average we are paid at more than double the Medicare or Medicaid rates for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans. Patients covered by employer group health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As of year end 2005, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $134 and $159 per treatment, or an overall average of $145 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. The majority of our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. The commercial payment rates are under continuous downward pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers, and may be further negatively impacted by the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. Our year over year treatment volume growth was as follows: 2005 2004 Treatment growth related to: Existing and newly opened centers 5.4 % 5.8 % Routine center acquisitions 7.5 % 5.0 % DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition effective 10/1/05 23.0 % Total treatment growth 35.9 % 10.8 % The average dialysis revenue per treatment for continuing operations was $313, $313 and $305 for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The revenue per treatment averages for continuing operations for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2005, prior to the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, were approximately $317 and $314 per treatment, respectively. Principal factors affecting our average revenue per treatment were increases in our standard fee schedules (impacting non contracted commercial revenue), changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial contract negotiations, together with a relatively stable mix of commercial patients and commercial rates. The combined average revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter 2005, including DVA Renal Healthcares results effective October 1 2005, was $311 per treatment. The decrease in average revenue per treatment in the fourth quarter reflects a lower average revenue per treatment attributable to the DVA Renal Healthcare centers and a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals in the quarter. DVA Renal Healthcares percentage mix of government and non government patients is similar to our historical percentages. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future. Additionally, the integration process for the DVA Renal Healthcare billing system could adversely affect our collections through the two to three year transition period. Lab and other services. Lab and other services represented approximately 4% of net operating revenues for 2005 and 2004. A third party carrier review of Medicare claims associated with our Florida based laboratory was initiated in 1998. No Medicare payments were received for our lab services from the second quarter of 1998 until the third quarter of 2002 while we were appealing the Medicare payment withholds. Following a favorable administrative law judge ruling in June 2002, payments for the earliest review periods, as well as for current lab services, were received in the third quarter of 2002. Favorable rulings were subsequently received for the other review periods, resulting in additional recoveries. Prior year recoveries include approximately $59 million received in 2002, $24 million in 2003, $8 million in 2004, and $4 million in 2005. As of December 31, 2005, there are no significant unresolved Medicare lab billing issues. 37 Table of Contents Management fee income. Management fee income represented less than 1% of net operating revenues for 2005 and 2004. We operated or provided administrative services to 38 and 34 third party or minority owned dialysis centers as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our management fees are principally based on a percentage of the revenue of the managed operations, or based upon a percentage of operating income. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and facility costs. As a percentage of current period operating revenues, patient care costs were approximately 69% for 2005, 68% for 2004 and 68% for 2003. On a per treatment basis, patient care costs increased year over year approximately $4 and $7 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2005 was principally due to higher labor and benefit costs, and to a lesser extent medical supply costs. The overall average patient care costs per treatment in the fourth quarter of 2005 were $228 or approximately $4 higher than the full year average. This increase in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by higher pharmaceutical and other medical supply costs, and reflects the blended average of the combined operations after the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to higher labor costs and increases in the levels of revenue generating physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The higher labor costs reflect rising labor rates and the effect of the increase in the number of newly opened centers, which are not yet at normal productivity levels. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and include expenses for corporate and divisional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions, and regulatory compliance oversight. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of current period operating revenues were 9.2%, 8.9%, and 8.4% in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expense for 2005 was primarily due to infrastructure costs for expanding business operations, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives and government investigations, higher labor costs, and integration costs associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. The increase in 2004 principally consisted of higher labor costs, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives, and increases in support infrastructure for corporate initiatives and business expansion. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was approximately 4% of current period operating revenues for each of the past three years, and for the fourth quarter of 2005. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding valuations of intangibles acquired or assumed in connection with the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. Provision for uncollectible accounts. As a result of the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition and the higher historical provision rate for DVA Renal Healthcare, the post acquisition average provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2005. The provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately 2.1% of current period operating revenues for the full year 2005, and 1.8% for 2004 and 2003. Minority interests and equity income, net. Minority interests net of equity income increased in 2005 by approximately $10 million over 2004 due to an increase in new centers having minority partners as well as growth in the earnings of our joint ventures. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, and investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. 38 Table of Contents Other income Other income, which was a net of approximately $9 million, $4 million, and $3 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, consisted principally of interest income. Debt expense and refinancing charges Debt expense for 2005, 2004, and 2003 consisted of interest expense of approximately $134 million, $50 million, and $64 million, respectively, and amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $5 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004, and $3 million in 2003. The increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to borrowings under our new credit facility in connection with the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, increases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates and issuance of our new senior and senior subordinated notes that have average fixed interest rates of approximately 7.0%, offset by changes in our LIBOR based receipts from swap settlements. The decrease in interest expense in 2004 as compared to 2003 was due to changes in the mix of our debt instruments. For most of 2003 we incurred higher interest rates on our senior subordinated notes, which were paid off in the second half of 2003 and replaced with lower interest rate borrowings from our prior credit facility. This decrease was partially offset by the effect on interest rates from our swap agreements and higher average debt balances. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2005 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 37.4%, compared with 38.6%, and 39.0% in 2004 and 2003. The lower effective tax rates for 2005 and 2004 were primarily due to lower state income taxes and tax valuation allowance adjustments. We currently project that the effective income tax rate for 2006 will be in the range of 39% to 40%. The higher projected rate for 2006 is principally due to favorable tax valuation adjustments in 2005, higher effective state income tax rates, and lower levels of tax exempt interest income. Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2005 and 2004 represented approximately 71 and 69 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt provision. The relative increase in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2005 reflects an increased level of delayed billings and delayed cash collections associated with the Medicare certification process for newly opened and acquired centers, as well as general collection patterns. As of December 31, 2005 approximately $47 million in unreserved accounts receivable, which represented less than 6% of our total unreserved accounts receivable balance, were more than six months old. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than one half of 1% of our treatments are classified as patient pay. Virtually all revenue realized is from government and non government third party payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2005, other than the standard monthly processing, consisted of approximately $24 million associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other accounts receivable. Our Medicare bad debt claims are typically not paid to us until the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims, and such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements except for potentially limiting the collectibility of Medicare bad debt claims. DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition On October 5, 2005, we completed our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, Inc. (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare, Inc.) from Gambro, Inc. under a Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 6, 2004, for $3.06 billion, subject to a tax basis step up election. DVA Renal Healthcare was one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers serving approximately 43,000 39 Table of Contents patients and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion. We have incurred approximately $29 million in acquisition related costs through December 31, 2005. If we make an election pursuant to section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code as permitted under the Stock Purchase Agreement, we would be required to make an additional cash payment to Gambro Inc., which we currently estimate to be approximately $170 million. This election would result in tax benefits realizable over 15 years. In conjunction with the acquisition, we entered into an Alliance and Product Supply Agreement (the Supply Agreement) with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. for a minimum of 10 years. The Supply Agreement has an initial term of seven years and will automatically renew for three additional one year periods if we have not negotiated the terms of an extension during the initial term period. Under the Supply Agreement we are committed to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices. For the year ended December 31, 2005 our total expenditures on such items was approximately 8% of our total operating costs. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Divestitures per Federal Trade Commission Consent Order. As a condition of completing the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, we were required by the Federal Trade Commission to divest a total of 69 outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements. On October 6, 2005, DaVita and DVA Renal Healthcare completed the sale of 70 outpatient renal dialysis centers to Renal Advantage Inc., formerly known as RenalAmerica, Inc. and also completed the sale of one other center to a separate physician group, and terminated the two management services agreements. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, we completed the sale of three additional centers to Renal Advantage Inc. that were previously pending state regulatory approval in Illinois. We received total cash consideration of approximately $330 million for all of the centers divested and used approximately $13 million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture, to distribute a minority owners share of the sale proceeds, and to pay related transaction costs. We anticipate paying related income taxes of approximately $90 million on these divestitures. As part of this transaction, Renal Advantage assumed specific liabilities related to the centers and all other liabilities were retained by the Company. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers are accounted for as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2005 our cash balance was $432 million and we had undrawn credit facilities totaling $250 million, of which approximately $50 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations over the next twelve months. Cash flow from operations during 2005 amounted to $486 million, compared with $420 million, including after tax Medicare lab recoveries of $17 million for 2004. Non operating cash outflows in 2005 included $161 million for capital asset expenditures, including $93 million for new center developments and $3,202 million for acquisitions. We also received in 2005 approximately $298 million from the sale of discontinued operations. Non operating cash outflows in 2004 included $128 million for capital asset expenditures, including $83 million for new center developments, $266 million for acquisitions and $97 million for stock repurchases. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare in the fourth quarter of 2005 resulted in the net addition of 492 dialysis centers after related divestitures. We acquired 54 other dialysis centers and opened 46 new dialysis centers during 2005. During 2004, we acquired a total of 51 dialysis centers and opened 44 new dialysis centers. The largest acquisition during 2004 was the purchase of the common stock of Physicians Dialysis, Inc. (PDI), for approximately $150 million, which added 24 centers. We currently expect to spend approximately $125 million to $135 million for general capital asset expenditures in 2006, and approximately $130 million to $150 million for new center development and center acquisitions. Our current projections include opening approximately 40 new centers in 2006. We expect to 40 Table of Contents generate approximately $410 million to $480 million of operating cash flow in 2006, before capital expenditures and acquisitions. 2005 capital structure changes. On October 5, 2005, we entered into a new credit agreement allowing for borrowings of up to $3.05 billion. The facilities under the credit agreement consist of a $250 million six year revolving credit facility, a $350 million six year term loan A facility and a $2,450 million seven year term loan B facility (the Facilities). Existing borrowings under the Facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus margins initially ranging from 2.00% to 2.25%. The margins are subject to adjustment depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios and can range from 1.50% to 2.25% for the revolving credit facility and the term loan A, and 2.00% to 2.25% for the term loan B. The Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets. The credit agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and requires compliance with financial covenants, including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio that determine the interest rate margins described above. The aggregate amount of the Facilities may be increased by up to $500 million as long as no default exists or would result from such increase and we remain in compliance with the financial covenants after such increase. Such additional loans would be on substantially the same terms as the original borrowings under the Facilities. The term loan A requires annual principal payments of $35 million in 2006, $39.4 million in 2007, $52.5 million in 2008, $61.2 million in 2009, $87.5 million in 2010, and $65.6 in 2011, maturing in October 2011. The term loan B requires annual principal payments of $24.5 million in years 2006 through 2010, $594 million in 2011 and $1,727 million in 2012, maturing in October 2012. On October 5, 2005, we borrowed $2,850 million under the Facilities ($50 million on the revolving credit facility, $350 million on the term loan A and $2,450 million on term loan B), and used these borrowings, along with available cash of $252 million, to purchase DVA Renal Healthcare and pay related bank fees and expenses of approximately $47 million and to pay fees and expenses in connection with terminating our then existing credit facility. On October 7, 2005, we repaid the $50 million of the revolving credit facility with proceeds from the sale of the divested centers. On March 22, 2005, we issued $500 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015 and incurred related deferred financing costs of $28.6 million. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, and require semi annual interest payments. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. We used the net proceeds of $1,323 million along with available cash of $46 million to repay all outstanding amounts under the term loan portions of our then existing credit facilities, including accrued interest. In conjunction with the repayment and extinguishment of our prior credit facilities during 2005, we wrote off deferred financing costs of $8.2 million and reclassified into net income $8.1 million of swap valuation gains that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. These gains represented the accumulated fair value of several interest rate swap instruments that became ineffective as cash flow hedges as a result of the repayment of our prior credit facilities. In addition we recorded a net loss of $2.1 million related to changes in fair values of these swaps that were not effective as interest rate hedges until they were redesignated in the second quarter of 2005. Portions of our various interest rate swap agreements that were previously designated and expected to be effective as forward cash flow hedges became ineffective as a result of us not having any variable rate LIBOR based interest payments during a portion of 2005. This resulted in a net charge of $1.7 million to swap valuation gains, which includes the $1.5 million discussed below as well as a reclassification into income of $2.0 million of swap valuation losses that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. The swap payment periods 41 Table of Contents that began after October 2005 were highly effective cash flow hedges with gains or losses from changes in their fair values reported in other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2005, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1,580 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.2675%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 6.1%, which included the term loan B margin of 2.25%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2005, we incurred net cash obligations of approximately $1.8 million from these swaps, $0.3 million of which is included in debt expense and $1.5 million of which is included in swap valuation gains. As of December 31, 2005, the total fair value of these swaps was an asset of approximately $30.8 million. Also during 2005, we recorded $16.8 million, net of tax, of additional comprehensive income for the changes in fair value of the effective portions of these swaps. At December 31, 2005, our overall credit facility average effective interest rate was 6.62%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.74%. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 55% of our variable rate debt and approximately 70% of our total debt economically fixed. 2004 capital structure changes. In the third quarter of 2004, we amended our then existing credit facilities in order to modify certain restricted payment covenants principally for acquisitions and share repurchases and we extended the maturity of the then existing term loan B until June 30, 2010. We also borrowed an additional $250 million under a new term loan C principally to fund potential acquisitions and share repurchases. The Term Loan C interest rate was LIBOR plus 1.75% for an overall effective rate of 4.16% at December 31, 2004. Under the previously announced Board authorization for share repurchases, we repurchased a total of 3,350,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $28.82 per share during 2004. On November 2, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $200 million of our common stock, from time to time, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The total outstanding Board authorizations for share repurchases are now approximately $249 million. In the first quarter of 2004, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate of 3.08%, plus the Term Loan B margin of 2.00%, for an overall effective rate of 5.08% as of December 31, 2004. The total amortizing notional amount of the swap was $135 million matched with the Term Loan B outstanding debt. The agreement expires in January 2009 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2004, the notional amount of this swap was $135 million and its fair value was an asset of $1.7 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $1.1 million, net of tax. In the third quarter of 2004, we entered into another interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate of 3.64%, plus the Term Loan C margin of 1.75%, for an overall effective rate of 5.39% as of December 31, 2004. The total $75 million non amortizing notional amount of the swap was matched with the Term Loan C outstanding debt. The agreement expires in August 2008 and requires quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2004 the fair value of the swap was an asset of $0.1 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $0.06 million, net of tax. As of December 31, 2004, we maintained three interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $345 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 3.64%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.27%, which includes the term loan B margin of 2.00% and a term loan C margin of 1.75%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 and 2009 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2004, we 42 Table of Contents incurred net cash obligations of $5.3 million from these swaps which is included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2004, the fair value of these swaps was an asset of $2.4 million resulting in additional comprehensive income during the year of $3.9 million before tax. On December 10, 2004 we entered into two forward interest rate swap agreements that will have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rate to a fixed rate at 3.875% effective July 1, 2005. The total amortizing notional amount of these two swaps is $800 million and both expire in January 2010 and require quarterly interest payments that began in October 2005. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate notional amount of these swaps was $800 million and their fair value was an asset of $0.4 million, which resulted in additional comprehensive income during the year of $0.2 million, net of tax. As a result of our swap agreements, over 80% of our outstanding variable rate debt was economically fixed as of December 31, 2004. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers, in the form of put provisions in joint venture agreements, which are exercisable at the third party owners future discretion. These put provisions, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the equity interest put to us. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several third party centers including minority owned centers and centers and clinics that we operate under administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2005 (in millions): Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 71 $ 143 $ 199 $ 3,737 $ 4,150 Interest payments on senior and senior subordinated notes 95 190 190 360 835 Capital lease obligations 1 3 1 2 7 Operating leases 137 236 178 267 818 $ 304 $ 572 $ 568 $ 4,366 $ 5,810 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 48 $ 48 Acquisition of dialysis centers 105 27 30 17 179 Working capital advances to third parties under administrative services agreements 15 15 $ 168 $ 27 $ 30 $ 17 $ 242 Not included above are interest payments related to our credit facilities. Our credit facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus margins ranging from 1.50% and 2.25% and are adjustable depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2005 our credit facilities had a combined effective interest rate of 6.62%. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific payment period tranches within each Term Loan. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of principal payments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no prepayments on our credit facilities during 2006 and no changes in the effective interest rate, approximately $182 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2006. 43 Table of Contents In addition to the above commitments, we have an agreement with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment over the next ten years, in accordance with the Alliance and Product Supply Agreement that we entered into in conjunction with our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. Our total expenditures on such items has been approximately 8% of our total operating costs. The actual amount of purchases in future years under the Alliance and Product Supply Agreement will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating and capital requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers and Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. See Note 3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the valuation of this commitment. Contingencies Our revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements; and (5) claims for refunds from private payors. On March 4, 2005, we received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. The subpoena requires production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including documents related to, among other things, pharmaceutical and other services provided to patients, relationships with pharmaceutical companies, financial relationships with physicians and joint ventures. The subpoena covers the period from December 1, 1996 through the present. The subject matter of this subpoena significantly overlaps with the subject matter of the investigation being conducted by the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. We have met with representatives of the government to discuss the scope of the subpoena and are in the process of producing responsive documents. In October 2005, we received a request for additional documents related to specific medical director and joint venture arrangements. In February 2006, we received an additional subpoena for documents, including certain patient records, relating to the administration and billing of EPO. We intend to continue to cooperate with the governments investigation. The subpoenas have been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time, although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved. Compliance with the subpoenas will continue to require management attention and legal expense. In addition, criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. On October 25, 2004, we received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys office for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. The subpoena covers the period from 1996 to present and requires the production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including DaVita Laboratory Services. The subpoena also includes specific requests for documents relating to testing for parathyroid hormone levels or PTH, and to products relating to vitamin D therapies. We believe that the subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena, including Fresenius Medical Group, Renal Care Group and our recently acquired subsidiary, DVA Renal Healthcare. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us or DVA Renal Healthcare at this time, although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved. Compliance with the subpoenas will continue to require management attention and legal expense. In addition, criminal proceedings may be initiated against us or DVA Renal Healthcare in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and DVA Renal Healthcare, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. In February 2001, the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of our historical 44 Table of Contents practices, including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians. We cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the United States Attorneys Office. In May 2002, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office and the Philadelphia office of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG. The subpoena requires an update to the information we provided in our response to the February 2001 request, and also seeks a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services, as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The subpoena covers the period from May 1996 to May 2002. We have provided the documents requested and continue to cooperate with the United States Attorneys Office and the OIG in its investigation. If this review proceeds, the government could expand its areas of concern. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time, although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We have received several informal inquiries from representatives of the New York Attorney Generals Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, or MFCU, regarding certain aspects of the EPO practices taking place at facilities managed by us in New York. We are cooperating with the MFCUs informal inquiries and have provided documents and information to the MFCU. To the best of our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us and the MFCU has not indicated an intention to do so, although we cannot predict whether we will receive further inquiries or whether or when proceedings might be initiated. In June 2004, DVA Renal Healthcare was served with a complaint filed in the Superior Court of California by one of its former employees that worked for its California acute services program. The complaint, which is styled as a class action, alleges, among other things, that DVA Renal Healthcare failed to provide overtime wages, defined rest periods and meal periods, or compensation in lieu of such provisions and failed to comply with certain other California labor code requirements. We are evaluating the claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the matter. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot estimate the range of damages, if any. On August 8, 2005, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against Gambro AB, DVA Renal Healthcare and related entities. The plaintiff seeks to bring its claims as a class action on behalf of itself and all entities that paid any of the defendants for health care goods and services from on or about January 1991 through at least December 2004. The complaint alleges, among other things, damages resulting from facts and circumstances underlying DVA Renal Healthcares December 2004 settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States Government. We are investigating these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the matter. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot estimate the range of damages, if any. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including from time to time, contractual disputes and professional and general liability claims. We may also be subject to additional claims by commercial payors and other third parties relating to billing practices and other matters covered by the DVA Renal Healthcare settlement agreement with the Department of Justice. We believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information 45 Table of Contents available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts, impairments of long lived assets, variable compensation accruals, accounting for income taxes and purchase accounting valuation estimates, are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize for a reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the more than 500 commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g. 80% for Medicare patients) and b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g. Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 96,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. Our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk is generally expected to be within 1% of total revenue, which can represent as much as 5% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as applicable. Impairment reviews are performed whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill. 46 Table of Contents Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, awards and benefit plan contributions, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. The valuation of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired or assumed in connection with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition required numerous assessments and assumptions, including those concerning dialysis industry trends, our companys business strategies and plans, the strategies of present or potential competitors, the quality of our continuing relationships with physicians and teammates and the likely effects of changes in those relationships, and other competitive and market conditions including those that involve dialysis product suppliers. These assumptions include expected outcomes under different acquisition agreement terms, and as a result, involve estimates of which the ultimate accuracy will never be known. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Long lived tangible and intangible assets will be subject to our regular ongoing impairment assessments. Significant new accounting standards Effective January 1, 2006 we adopted SFAS Statement No. 123R, Share Based Payment, that amended FASB Statements No. 123 and 95 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. This standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, such as stock options, based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize such cost over the requisite period during which an employee provides service. The grant date fair value will be determined using option pricing models adjusted for unique characteristics of the equity instruments. The standard also addresses the accounting for transactions that involve the creation of a liability in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of its equity instruments or that may be settled through the issuance of such equity instruments. The standard does not change the accounting for transactions of equity instruments issued for services to non employees or the accounting for employee stock ownership plans. The standard also requires that the tax benefits realized from stock option exercises in excess of the stock based compensation expenses recognizable for financial statement purposes be reported as a cash flows from financing activities rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required. This would reduce net operating cash flows 47 Table of Contents and increase net financing cash flows upon adoption. We currently expect that our pretax stock option expense will be in the range of $20 million to $30 million, significantly dependent on the timing and amounts of grants in 2006, as well as the Companys stock price at those future dates. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2005. The variable rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of 2005 including the economic effects of our swap agreements. These rates are based on LIBOR plus margins based upon performance and leverage criteria plus the economic impact from the swap agreements. The margins currently in effect range from 2.00% to 2.25%. For our interest rate swap agreements, the table below presents the notional amounts by contract maturity date and the related interest rate terms of the agreements (to pay fixed rates, and to receive LIBOR). Expected maturity date Total Fair Value Average interest rate 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 10 $ 3 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1,352 $ 1,368 $ 1,387 6.98% Variable rate $ 62 $ 64 $ 78 $ 86 $ 112 $ 2,387 $ 2,789 $ 2,789 6.62% Notionalamount Contract maturity date Pay fixed Receivevariable Fairvalue 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 (dollars in millions) Swaps: Pay fixed swaps $ 1,580 $ 240 $ 372 $ 378 $ 401 $ 189 3.08% to 4.2675% LIBOR $ 30.8 As of December 31, 2005, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1,580 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.2675% for an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 6.1%, which included the term loan B margin of 2.25%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2005, we incurred net cash obligations of approximately $1.8 million from these swaps, $0.3 million of which is included in debt expense and $1.5 million of which is included in swap valuation gains. As of December 31, 2005, the total fair value of these swaps was an asset of approximately $30.8 million. Also during 2005, we recorded $16.8 million, net of tax, of additional comprehensive income for the changes in fair value of the effective portions of these swaps. In conjunction with the repayment and extinguishment of our prior credit facilities during 2005, we reclassified into net income $8.1 million of swap valuation gains that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. These gains represented the accumulated fair value of several interest rate swap instruments that became ineffective as cash flow hedges as a result of the repayment of our prior credit facilities. In addition we recorded a net loss of $2.1 million related to changes in fair values of these swaps that were not effective as interest rate hedges until they were redesignated in the second quarter of 2005. Portions of our various interest rate swap agreements that were previously designated and expected to be effective as forward cash flow hedges became ineffective as a result of us not having any variable rate LIBOR based interest payments during a portion of 2005. This resulted in a net charge of $1.7 million to swap valuation gains, which includes the $1.5 million discussed above as well as a reclassification into income of $2.0 million of swap valuation losses that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. The swap payment periods 48 Table of Contents that began after October 2005 were highly effective as cash flow hedges with gains or losses from changes in their fair values reported in other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2005, our overall credit facility average effective interest rate was 6.62%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.74%. As a result of all of our swap agreements, we had over 55% of our outstanding variable rate debt economically fixed and approximately 70% of our total debt economically fixed as of December 31, 2005. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $3.2 million, $5.9 million, and $6.5 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk.
