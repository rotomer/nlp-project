Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the notes to our consolidated financial statements. On September 11, 2003, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $200 million of the Companys common stock, with no expiration date. On November 2, 2004, the Company announced that the Board of Directors approved an increase in the Companys authorization to repurchase shares of its common stock by an additional $200 million. The Company is authorized to make purchases from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other considerations. However, under the terms of our credit facilities and our senior and senior subordinated notes, we have share repurchase limitations. There were no repurchases of our common stock during 2006 and 2005. We had approximately $249 million available from Board authorizations to repurchase shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2006. 32 Table of Contents Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The following table presents selected consolidated financial and operating data for the periods indicated. In October 2005, we acquired DVA Renal Healthcare for approximately $3.06 billion. DVA Renal Healthcare was one of the largest dialysis services providers in the United States operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion. In conjunction with a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission, on October 4, 2005, we divested a total of 71 centers and terminated two management service agreements. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, we divested three additional centers that were previously pending state regulatory approval in order to complete the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. See footnote (6) below. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results from October 1, 2005, and the operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income for 2005 and prior. The following financial and operating data should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this report.

We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,300 outpatient dialysis centers and 770 hospitals, serving approximately 103,000 patients. In October 2005, we acquired DVA Renal Healthcare, Inc., then one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, for approximately $3.06 billion. At the time of the acquisition, DVA Renal Healthcare was operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results effective October 1, 2005. In accordance with a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission on October 4, 2005, we were required to divest a total of 69 outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements in order for us to complete the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. In 2005, we divested a total of 71 centers and terminated the two management services agreements. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, we completed the sale of three additional centers that were previously pending state regulatory approval. We received total cash consideration of approximately $330 million for all of the centers divested and used approximately $13 million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture, to distribute a minority owners share of the sale proceeds, and to pay related transaction costs. We also paid approximately $85 million in related income taxes in the first quarter of 2006. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers and its one management services agreement are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for 2005 and prior. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three areas, our patients, our teammates, and our business partners, represent the major drivers of our long term 35 Table of Contents success, aside from external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes have improved over each of the past three years, and in 2006 we achieved another year of excellent clinical outcomes. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. Over the past several years we have achieved significant reductions in teammate turnover, which has been a major contributor to our performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. Our operations are presented as a single reporting segment, with approximately 98% of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis and dialysis related services, such as laboratory services (collectively dialysis revenue). Eighty two percent of our dialysis revenue is derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in 1,262 centers that we consolidate that are either wholly owned or majority owned. Other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services, which combined accounted for approximately 15% of our dialysis revenue, and the remaining 3% of our dialysis revenue was from laboratory services. Our other operations include various ancillary services and strategic initiatives consisting primarily of vascular access services, disease management services, ESRD clinical research programs, oral pharmacy services and administration services to minority owned and third party owned centers and clinics, as further described in Item 1 in this Form 10 K. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives are aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our 103,000 patients. These services generated less than 2% of our total net revenues in 2006. We currently expect to continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and anticipate that these initiatives will develop into strategically successful new business operations. However, significant changes in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may ultimately impact or continue to impact the economic viability of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes could result in a write off of some or all of our investments in these strategic initiatives. The principal drivers of our dialysis revenue are a) the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week, b) average treatment revenue and c) laboratory patient testing. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our pace of opening and acquiring new centers. Our year over year treatment volume growth was as follows: 2006 2005 Treatment growth related to: Existing and newly opened centers 4.8 % 5.4 % Other center acquisitions 4.0 % 7.5 % DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition effective 10/1/05 51.5 % 23.0 % Total treatment growth 60.3 % 35.9 % Average dialysis revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, dialysis services charge capture, and our billing and collecting operations performance. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are more than double Medicare and Medicaid payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total 36 Table of Contents average revenue per treatment. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare did not materially affect our overall patient mix percentage. The following tables summarizes our dialysis revenue and patient percentages by payor type for the year ended December 31, 2006: Revenues Patient Percentages Medicare and Medicare assigned HMO plans 58 % 78 % Medicaid 4 % 6 % Other government based programs 3 % 3 % Total government based programs 65 % 87 % Commercial 35 % 13 % Total dialysis revenue 100 % 100 % Government payment rates are principally determined by federal (Medicare) and state (Medicaid) policy. These payment rates have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of being reduced. Cumulative net increases in Medicare payment rates from 1990 through 2006 totaled approximately 9%. There were no Medicare payment rate increases for 2003 and 2004. CMS implemented increases of 1.6% on January 1, 2006 and January 1, 2005, however the 2005 increase was more than offset by other structural changes to Medicare dialysis payment rates that also became effective January 1, 2005. In addition, CMS recently approved a 1.6% increase that will be effective on April 1, 2007. Medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures. Commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are at contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Over the past three years we have been successful in maintaining relatively stable average payment rates in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases, although we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors which may result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of commercial rate increases in the future. Approximately 30% of our dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006, has been associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for approximately 25% of our dialysis revenue. Therefore, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in private and governmental payment rates significantly influence our revenue levels. Such changes, driven by physician practice patterns and protocols focused on improving clinical outcomes, accounted for a significant portion of the increase in average revenue per treatment in 2006. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services charge capture and billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past three years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. We are currently in the process of upgrading our billing and collections systems as part of the integration of DVA Renal Healthcares systems, which could adversely affect our collection performance during the transition period. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis revenue per treatment including lab services for continuing operations was $330, $323 and $322 for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Principal factors affecting our average revenue per 37 Table of Contents treatment in 2006 were increases in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue) and changes in our commercial and government payor mix, as well as changes in the intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. In 2005, the average revenue per treatment was impacted by the lower average revenue per treatment attributable to the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition that became effective on October 1, 2005, and an overall decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, offset by increases in our commercial standard fee schedules. The average revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter 2005 following the acquisition was $320 per treatment. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future. Additionally, the continuing integration process for the DVA Renal Healthcare billing system could adversely affect our collection performance during the transition period. The principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost changes, such as increased insurance costs experienced in 2004. Our average clinical hours per treatment have improved over the past three years primarily because of reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in 2004 and 2005, and federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. In 2006, our clinical hours per treatment remained stable compared to 2005, however, we did experience an increase in our labor rates per treatment as labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. For the past three years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors. In addition, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO includes volume discount and other thresholds which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to meet those thresholds. Our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare did not have a significant impact on our overall patient costs on a per treatment basis. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenues over the past three years. However, this reflects substantial increases in spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes and legal and other professional fees. We expect that these higher levels of general and administrative expenses will be sustained or possibly increased in order to support our long term initiatives, including further investments in our strategic initiatives, and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Successful resolutions of disputed Medicare billings at our Florida lab resulted in recoveries related to prior years services being recognized as current period revenue and operating income of approximately $4 million, and $8 million in 2005, and 2004, respectively. We have received all expected recoveries and will not receive any additional recoveries in the future. Outlook for 2007. We currently estimate our operating income in 2007 to be in the range of $700 $760 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, possible reductions in private and government payment rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with our physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and the subpoenas from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri and DVA Renal Healthcares compliance with its corporate integrity agreement, our ability to complete and integrate acquisitions of businesses, and the successful integration of DVA Renal Healthcare, including its billing and collection operations. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 19 for more 38 Table of Contents information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. Results of operations Following is a summary of operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. Year ended December 31, Continuing Operations 2006 2005 2004 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, except per treatment data) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 4,881 100 % $ 2,970 100 % $ 2,169 100 % Prior years services laboratory 4 8 4,881 2,974 2,177 Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 3,390 70 % 2,036 69 % 1,470 68 % General and administrative 454 9 % 272 9 % 192 9 % Depreciation and amortization 173 4 % 117 4 % 83 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 126 2 % 62 2 % 39 2 % Minority interests and equity income, net 36 1 % 22 12 Valuation gain on Product Supply Agreement (38 ) Total operating expenses and charges 4,141 85 % 2,509 85 % 1,796 83 % Operating income $ 739 15 % $ 465 16 % $ 381 17 % Dialysis treatments 14,495,796 9,044,966 6,654,069 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 46,372 28,898 21,225 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 320 $ 313 $ 313 Average dialysis revenue per treatment (including the lab) $ 330 $ 323 $ 322 The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results from October 1, 2005. Our operating income margins, excluding recoveries for prior years lab services and the valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement declined from 15.5% in 2005 to 14.4% in 2006, primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs, additional integration costs and SFAS No. 123(R) stock based compensation expense. Net operating revenues Operating revenues for current period services increased 64% in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased 37% in 2005 compared to 2004. The number of dialysis treatments accounted for approximately 57% of the increase in revenues in 2006, with approximately 49% primarily due to the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare effective on October 1, 2005 and the balance from acquisitions and growth in existing and new centers. The remaining 7% increase in total net operating revenue in 2006 was due to increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment and additional management fees and revenue from ancillary services and strategic initiatives. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare in the fourth quarter of 2005 accounted for approximately 22% of the increase in 2005, approximately 12% was due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments with the balance of approximately 3% due to additional increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment and additional lab, management fees and ancillary revenue. 39 Table of Contents Dialysis revenue, which includes dialysis services and related laboratory services, represented approximately 98%, 98% and 99% of net operating revenues in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including management fee income, accounted for the balance of our total revenues. Dialysis Services Dialysis revenue. We generate approximately 82%, 9% and 6% of our total dialysis revenue from outpatient hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and home based dialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis, respectively, and 3% of our total dialysis revenue from laboratory services. Major components of dialysis revenue include both the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents approximately 30% of total dialysis revenue, and related laboratory services, as described below. Approximately 65% of our total dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 is from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage Plans, representing approximately 87% of our total patients. Our commercial payors consist principally of commercial insurance plans, including more than 1,200 with whom we have contracted rates. Approximately 13% of our dialysis revenue is associated with non contracted commercial payors. Less than 1% of our dialysis services and related dialysis services payments are received directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 5% of total dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. On average we are paid at more than double Medicare or Medicaid rates for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans. Patients covered by employer group health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As of December 31, 2006, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $147 and $162 per treatment, or an overall average of $155 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our patient care costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. While our commercial payment rates are under downward pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers, and we expect this trend to continue into 2007, we have been successful in offsetting these pressures through successful negotiating and price increases. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. Our year over year treatment volume growth was as follows: 2006 2005 Treatment growth related to: Existing and newly opened centers 4.8 % 5.4 % Other center acquisitions 4.0 % 7.5 % DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition effective 10/1/05 51.5 % 23.0 % Total treatment growth 60.3 % 35.9 % The annual average dialysis revenue per treatment, including lab services, for continuing operations was $330, $323 and $322 for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Principal factors affecting our average revenue per treatment in 2006 were increases in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue), and changes in our commercial and government payor mix, as well as changes in the intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. In 2005, the average revenue per treatment was impacted by the lower 40 Table of Contents average revenue per treatment attributable to the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition that became effective October 1, 2005, and an overall decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, offset by increases in our commercial standard fee schedules. The average revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter of 2005 following the acquisition was $320 per treatment. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future. Additionally, the continuing integration process for the DVA Renal Healthcare billing and collections operations could adversely affect our collections through the two to three year transition period. Lab revenues. Lab revenues represented approximately 3% of our total net operating revenues for 2006 and 2005. A third party carrier review of Medicare claims associated with our Florida based laboratory was initiated in 1998. No Medicare payments were received for our lab services from the second quarter of 1998 until the third quarter of 2002 while we were appealing the Medicare payment withholds. Following a favorable administrative law judge ruling in 2002, we began receiving prior year Medicare payments in the third quarter of 2002, and received a total of approximately $83 million prior to 2004, $8 million in 2004, and $4 million in 2005. There are no further significant unresolved Medicare lab billing issues. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including management fees, represented less than 2% of our total net operating revenues for both 2006 and 2005. Management fee income. Management fee income is included as part of our revenue from ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and represented less than 1% of net operating revenues for 2006 and 2005. We operated or provided administrative services to 38 third party or minority owned dialysis centers as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. We also provided management and administrative services to 30 physician owned vascular access clinics at December 31, 2006. Our management fees are principally based on a percentage of the revenue of the managed operations, cash collections, or based upon a percentage of operating income. In January 2007, we received notice that one of our management and administrative services agreements will be terminated on November 30, 2007. As of December 31, 2006 we provided management and administrative services to 19 dialysis centers under this agreement. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and facility costs. As a percentage of current period operating revenues, patient care costs were approximately 69.5% for 2006, 68.5% for 2005 and 67.8% for 2004. On a per treatment basis, patient care costs increased year over year approximately $9 and $4 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2006 was principally due to higher labor and benefit costs, increases in expenses related to our strategic initiatives and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The increase in 2005 was principally due to higher labor and benefit costs, and to a lesser extent medical supply costs. The higher labor costs in 2006 reflect rising labor rates mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel and the effect of the increase in the number of newly opened centers, which are not yet at normal productivity levels. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers, or the direct costs associated with our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and include expenses for corporate and divisional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions, and regulatory compliance oversight. General and 41 Table of Contents administrative expenses as a percentage of current period operating revenues were 9.3%, 9.2%, and 8.9% in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expense for 2006 was primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives and government investigations, integration costs associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition and stock based compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R). The increase in general and administrative expense for 2005 was primarily due to infrastructure costs for expanding business operations, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives and government investigations, higher labor costs, and integration costs associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was approximately 4% of current period operating revenues for each of the past three years. The absolute dollar increase in depreciation and amortization in 2006 was due to additional centers from acquisitions and newly opened centers, amortization of intangible assets associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, offset by the amortization of the Product Supply Agreement as described below. Provision for uncollectible accounts. As a result of the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition and the higher historical provision rate for DVA Renal Healthcare, the post acquisition average provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2005. This rate was consistently maintained in 2006 and is expected to remain stable in 2007. The provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately 2.1% of current period operating revenues for the full year 2005, and 1.8% for 2004. Minority interests and equity income, net. Minority interests net of equity income increased to approximately $36 million in 2006, an increase of approximately $14 million over 2005. The increase was primarily due to an increase in new centers having minority partners as well as growth in the earnings of our joint ventures. Product Supply Agreement. On May 29, 2006, we notified Gambro Renal Products Inc. (Gambro Renal Products) that we were terminating the Alliance and Product Supply Agreement (the Product Supply Agreement) with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products. The Product Supply Agreement was entered into on October 5, 2005, in conjunction with our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare and committed us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products supplies and equipment at fixed prices. Our termination notice claimed a material breach by Gambro Renal Products for failure to perform its obligations under the Product Supply Agreement, primarily as a result of an import ban issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration affecting certain hemodialysis products. On August 25, 2006, we entered into an amended and restated Product Supply Agreement (the Amended Supply Agreement), with Gambro Renal Products and Gambro AB. The Amended Supply Agreement effectively revoked our notice of termination of the Product Supply Agreement. The Amended Supply Agreement, among other things, relieves us of certain obligations, including releasing us from the purchase requirements for certain affected products during the import ban, permits us to secure alternate sources of supplies for the products affected by the import ban, reduces our purchase obligations for certain hemodialysis product supplies and equipment and also allows for the termination of the purchase obligations for equipment affected by the import ban if the import ban is not lifted by June 30, 2007. As a result of the reductions in the amount of purchase obligations that are now required under the Amended Supply Agreement, we recorded a net valuation gain of approximately $38.0 million. This valuation gain represents the difference in the fair value between the Product Supply Agreement and the Amended Supply Agreement, as of the effective date of the amendment. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses, and our ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a 42 Table of Contents review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. Debt expense Debt expense for 2006, 2005, and 2004 consisted of interest expense of approximately $263 million, $134 million, and $50 million, respectively, amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $10 million in 2006, $5 million in 2005, and $2 million in 2004, and in 2006, included the write off of approximately $3.3 million of deferred financing costs associated with the principal prepayments on our term loans. The increase in interest expense in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to additional borrowings outstanding during 2006 under our credit facility, the increase in the average outstanding balances of our senior and senior subordinated notes, which were issued in March 2005, and increases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. The increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to borrowings under our credit facility in connection with the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare that was effective October 1, 2005, increases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates and issuance of our new senior and senior subordinated notes that have average fixed interest rates of approximately 7.0%, offset by changes in our LIBOR based receipts from swap settlements. Other income Other income, which was a net of approximately $13 million, $9 million, and $4 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, consisted principally of interest income. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2006 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 39.2%, compared with 37.4% and 38.6% in 2005 and 2004 respectively. The changes in the effective tax rates were primarily due to state income taxes and tax valuation allowance adjustments. We currently project that the effective income tax rate for 2007 will be in the range of 39.5% to 40%. Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2006 and 2005 represented approximately 70 and 71 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt provision. The relative decrease in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2006 was a result of improved cash collections. As of December 31, 2006 approximately $50 million in unreserved accounts receivable, representing approximately 5% of our total accounts receivable balance, were more than six months old. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than one half of 1% of our treatments are classified as patient pay. Virtually all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, other than the standard monthly processing, consisted of approximately $16 million and $24 million, respectively, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Our Medicare bad debt claims are typically not paid to us until the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims, and such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements except for potentially limiting the collectibility of Medicare bad debt claims. 43 Table of Contents DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition On October 5, 2005, we completed our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, Inc. from Gambro, Inc. under a Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 6, 2004, for $3.06 billion. DVA Renal Healthcare was one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers serving approximately 43,000 patients and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our consolidated financial statements from October 1, 2005. Divestitures per Federal Trade Commission Consent Order. As a condition of completing the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, we were required by the Federal Trade Commission to divest a total of 69 outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements. On October 6, 2005, DaVita and DVA Renal Healthcare completed the sale of 71 outpatient renal dialysis centers, and terminated the two management services agreements. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, we completed the sale of three additional centers to Renal Advantage, Inc. that were previously pending state regulatory approval in Illinois. We received total cash consideration of approximately $330 million for all of the centers divested and used approximately $13 million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture, to distribute a minority owners share of the sale proceeds, and to pay related transaction costs. We also paid related income taxes of approximately $85 million on these divestitures during the first quarter of 2006. As part of this transaction, Renal Advantage assumed specific liabilities related to the centers and all other liabilities were retained by us. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers are accounted for as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for 2005 and prior. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2006 our cash balance was $310 million and we had undrawn credit facilities totaling $253.6 million, ($250 million with our senior secured credit facility and $3.6 million associated with several joint ventures) of which approximately $50 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2006 amounted to $520 million, compared with $486 million for 2005. Cash flow from operations in 2006 included an income tax payment of approximately $85 million associated with divestitures of certain centers in conjunction with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition and also included cash interest payments of approximately $272 million reflecting our higher outstanding debt balances as a result of the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. Cash interest payments in 2005 were approximately $86 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2006 included $263 million for capital asset expenditures, including $143 million for new center developments and an additional $87 million for acquisitions. We also received in 2006 approximately $22 million from the sale of discontinued operations and asset sales. Non operating cash outflows in 2005 included $161 million for capital asset expenditures, including $93 million for new center developments, and an additional $3,202 million for acquisitions. We also received in 2005 approximately $299 million from the sale of discontinued operations. During 2006, we acquired a total of 26 dialysis centers, including two centers that we previously held a minority owned interest, opened 55 new dialysis centers and divested, sold or closed 14 centers. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare in the fourth quarter of 2005 resulted in the net addition of 492 dialysis centers after related divestitures. We acquired 54 other dialysis centers and opened 46 new dialysis centers during 2005. We currently expect to spend approximately $110 million to $120 million for general maintenance capital asset expenditures in 2007, and approximately $200 million to $220 million for new center development, relocations and center acquisitions. Our current projections include opening approximately the same number of 44 Table of Contents centers in 2007 that we opened in 2006. We expect to generate approximately $440 million to $510 million of operating cash flow in 2007. 2006 capital structure changes and other capital items. During 2006, we made principal payments totaling $62 million on the term loan A and $338 million on the term loan B which included mandatory principal payments of $35 million and $24.5 million respectively. All of the mandatory principal payments were paid in advance of the scheduled payment dates in 2006. Because of the principal prepayments, our next mandatory principal payments are $12.4 million in 2007, $52.5 million in 2008, $61.3 million in 2009, $87.5 million in 2010, and $65.6 million in 2011, for the term loan A and $379 million in 2011 and $1,727 million in 2012, for the term loan B. As a result of the principal prepayment made in 2006, we wrote off approximately $3.3 million of deferred financing costs, which is included in debt expense. On March 1, 2006, our interest rate margins on our term loan A and term loan B (collectively, the Credit Facility), were reduced by 0.25% as a result of achieving certain financial ratios as defined in the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2006, the term loan A bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% and the term loan B bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%. The margins are subject to adjustment depending upon changes in our financial ratios and can range from 1.50% to 2.25% for the revolving credit facility and term loan A, and 2.00% to 2.25% for the term loan B. Our credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and requires compliance with certain financial covenants, including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio that determine the interest rate margins described above. The credit agreement also contains limits on the annual amount of expenditures for acquisitions and capital improvements. Our senior and senior subordinated notes consist of $500 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. As of December 31, 2006, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $1,341 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.88%, on the hedged portion of our Credit Facility, including the term loan B margin of 2.00%. The swap agreements require quarterly interest payments, bear amortizing notional amounts, and expire in 2008 through 2010. During 2006, we accrued net cash benefits of $15.8 million from these swaps which is included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2006, the total fair value of these swaps was an asset of $29.5 million. We recorded $7.9 million, net of tax, as an increase to comprehensive income for the change in fair value of the effective portions of these swaps during 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 56% of our variable rate debt and approximately 72% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements at December 31, 2006, our overall effective weighted average interest rate on the Credit Facility was 6.61%, based upon the current margins in effect ranging from 1.75% to 2.00%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.76%. On February 23, 2007, we issued $400 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 in a private offering. These senior notes are part of the same series of debt securities as the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% senior notes that were issued in March 2005. The senior notes are guaranteed by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments beginning March 15, 2007. The senior notes may be redeemed in whole or part at any time on or after March 15, 2009, at certain specified prices. We used the proceeds to pay down our term loan B and also wrote off approximately $4 million of term loan B deferred financing costs. 45 Table of Contents On February 23, 2007, we amended and restated our existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities to, among other things, reduce the interest rate margin on our term loan B by 0.50%, and to amend certain covenants. The new term loan B will bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%. If we refinance the term loan B prior to February 23, 2008, we will be subject to a prepayment penalty of 1.0%, otherwise the payment terms remain the same. In addition, the amount by which we can elect to increase the revolving and term loan commitments was changed from $500 million to $750 million. On February 7, 2007, we entered into a National Provider Agreement with NxStage, Inc. The agreement provides us the ability to purchase NxStage home based hemodialysis products at a potential discount depending upon the achievement of certain volume targets. The agreement has an initial term of three years, terminating on December 31, 2009, and may be extended in six month increments up to two additional years if certain volume targets are met. As a part of the agreement, we purchased outright all of our NxStage System One equipment currently in use for $5.1 million, and will purchase a majority of our future home based hemodialysis equipment and supplies from NxStage. In connection with the provider agreement, we purchased 2 million shares of NxStage common stock in a private placement offering for $20 million, representing an ownership position of approximately 7%. In connection with the purchase of the shares, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement under which NxStage has agreed to register the shares. Stock based compensation Effective January 1, 2006, we implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R) Share Based Payment, which requires the measurement and recognition of cost for all stock based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, and discounted employee stock purchases. Under SFAS No. 123 (R) our stock based compensation awards are measured at estimated fair value on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense over their requisite service periods. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes our previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, under which we did not recognize compensation expense for most of our stock options. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 relating to the application of SFAS No. 123(R), and we have applied the provisions of SAB No. 107 in our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We implemented SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. In accordance with this method, our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to fiscal year 2006 have not been restated to reflect this change. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires that tax benefits realized from stock award exercise gains in excess of stock based compensation expense recognized for financial statement purposes be reported as cash flows from financing activities rather than as operating cash flows. We also elected to use the method available under FASB Staff Position FSP No. 123(R) 3 Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards, which provides an alternative method for calculating historical excess tax benefits from the method described in SFAS No. 123(R) for stock based compensation awards. Under SFAS No. 123(R), stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of the stock based award vesting during that period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for 2006 includes compensation cost for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of, December 31, 2005 and stock based awards granted in 2006. We previously recognized the effect of stock unit forfeitures as they occurred, and the effect of transitioning to recognition of expense based on expected forfeitures was insignificant. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in 2006, as well as for stock option grants during all prior periods. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized $26.4 million in stock based compensation expense for stock options, stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock units and discounted employee stock plan 46 Table of Contents purchases, which is primarily included in general and administrative expenses in continuing operations. The estimated tax benefit recorded for this stock based compensation was $9.7 million. As of December 31, 2006, there was $67.7 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.7 years. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we received $37.9 million in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $40.4 million in actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. 2005 capital structure changes. On October 5, 2005, we entered into a credit agreement allowing for borrowings of up to $3.05 billion. The facilities under the credit agreement consist of a $250 million six year revolving credit facility, a $350 million six year term loan A facility and a $2,450 million seven year term loan B facility (the Facilities). Existing borrowings under the Facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus margins initially ranging from 2.00% to 2.25%. The margins are subject to adjustment depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios and can range from 1.50% to 2.25% for the revolving credit facility and the term loan A, and 2.00% to 2.25% for the term loan B. The Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets. The credit agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and requires compliance with financial covenants, including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio that determine the interest rate margins described above. The aggregate amount of the Facilities may be increased by up to $500 million as long as no default exists or would result from such increase and we remain in compliance with the financial covenants after such increase. Such additional loans would be on substantially the same terms as the original borrowings under the Facilities. On October 5, 2005, we borrowed $2,850 million under the Facilities ($50 million on the revolving credit facility, $350 million on the term loan A and $2,450 million on term loan B), and used these borrowings, along with available cash of $252 million, to purchase DVA Renal Healthcare and pay related bank fees and expenses of approximately $47 million and to pay fees and expenses in connection with terminating our then existing credit facility. On October 7, 2005, we repaid the $50 million of the revolving credit facility with proceeds from the sale of the divested centers. On March 22, 2005, we issued $500 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015 and incurred related deferred financing costs of $28.6 million. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, and require semi annual interest payments. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. We used the net proceeds of $1,323 million along with available cash of $46 million to repay all outstanding amounts under the term loan portions of our then existing credit facilities, including accrued interest. In conjunction with the repayment and extinguishment of our prior credit facilities during 2005, we wrote off deferred financing costs of $8.2 million and reclassified into net income $8.1 million of swap valuation gains that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. These gains represented the accumulated fair value of several interest rate swap instruments that became ineffective as cash flow hedges as a result of the repayment of our prior credit facilities. In addition we recorded a net loss of $2.1 million related to changes in fair values of these swaps that were not effective as interest rate hedges until they were redesignated in the second quarter of 2005. Portions of our various interest rate swap agreements that were previously designated and expected to be effective as forward cash flow hedges became ineffective as a result of us not having any variable rate LIBOR based interest payments during a portion of 2005. This resulted in a net charge of $1.7 million to swap valuation gains, which includes the $1.5 million discussed below as well as a reclassification into income of $2.0 million of swap valuation losses that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. The swap payment periods 47 Table of Contents that began after October 2005 were highly effective cash flow hedges with gains or losses from changes in their fair values reported in other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2005, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1,580 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 6.1%, which included the term loan B margin of 2.25%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2005, we incurred net cash obligations of approximately $1.8 million from these swaps, $0.3 million of which is included in debt expense and $1.5 million of which is included in swap valuation gains. As of December 31, 2005, the total fair value of these swaps was an asset of approximately $30.8 million. Also during 2005, we recorded $16.8 million, net of tax, of additional comprehensive income for the changes in fair value of the effective portions of these swaps. At December 31, 2005, our overall credit facility weighted average effective interest rate was 6.62%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.74%. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 55% of our variable rate debt and approximately 70% of our total debt economically fixed. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers, in the form of put provisions in joint venture agreements, which are exercisable at the third party owners future discretion. These put provisions, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the equity interest put to us. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several other third party owned centers, minority owned centers and physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under administrative services agreements. 48 Table of Contents The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2006 (in millions): Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 18 $ 117 $ 532 $ 3,077 $ 3,744 Interest payments on senior and senior subordinated notes 95 190 190 264 739 Capital lease obligations 3 1 1 2 7 Operating leases 148 258 198 294 898 $ 264 $ 566 $ 921 $ 3,637 $ 5,388 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 50 $ 50 Acquisition of dialysis centers 100 38 33 21 192 Working capital advances to third parties under administrative services agreements 11 11 $ 161 $ 38 $ 33 $ 21 $ 253 Not included above are interest payments related to our credit facilities. Our credit facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus margins ranging from 1.75% and 2.00% and are adjustable depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2006 our credit facilities had an overall effective weighted average interest rate of 6.61%. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific debt tranches within each Term Loan, which can range in maturity from one month to twelve months. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of mandatory principal payments and principal prepayments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no principal prepayments on our credit facilities during 2007 and no changes in the effective interest rate during 2007, approximately $158 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2007. In addition to the above commitments, we entered into an Alliance and Product Supply Agreement on October 5, 2005, with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. in conjunction with our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare that committed us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices over the next ten years. The Alliance and Product Supply Agreement was amended on August 25, 2006 to reduce our purchase obligations for certain hemodialysis product supplies and equipment and to allow for the termination of purchase obligations for certain equipment currently affected by an import ban issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration if the import ban is not lifted by June 30, 2007. The amended supply agreement continues to require us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis product supplies and equipment at fixed prices. Our total expenditures in 2006 on such products were approximately 4% of our total operating costs. The actual amount of purchases in future years under the amended supply agreement will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating and capital requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs and Gambro Renal Products ability to have the import ban lifted by June 30, 2007. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the valuation of this commitment. Contingencies The majority of our revenues are from government programs and may be subject to adjustment as a result of: (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; and (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental 49 Table of Contents requirements. In addition, our revenues from commercial payors may be subject to adjustment as a result of potential claims for refunds from commercial payors, as a result of government actions or as a result of other claims by commercial payors. United States Attorney inquiries On March 4, 2005, we received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office, or U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. The subpoena requires production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including documents related to, among other things, pharmaceutical and other services provided to patients, relationships with pharmaceutical companies, and financial relationships with physicians and joint ventures. The subpoena covers the period from December 1, 1996 through the present. In October 2005, we received a follow up request for additional documents related to specific medical director and joint venture arrangements. In February 2006, we received an additional subpoena for documents, including certain patient records relating to the administration and billing of Epogen (EPO). We are producing documents and providing information to the government. We are also cooperating, and intend to continue to cooperate, with the governments investigation, including by participating in discussions and meetings with the government. The subpoenas have been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as this to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoenas will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. On October 25, 2004, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. The subpoena covers the period from 1996 to present and requires the production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including DaVita Laboratory Services. The subpoena also includes specific requests for documents relating to testing for parathyroid hormone levels (PTH), and to products relating to vitamin D therapies. The subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and DVA Renal Healthcare, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena, including Fresenius Medical Group, Renal Care Group and DVA Renal Healthcare, which was acquired by us in October of 2005. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us or DVA Renal Healthcare at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoena may continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. In February 2001, the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of our historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians. We cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the U.S. Attorneys Office. In May 2002, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office and the Philadelphia Office of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG). The subpoena required an update to the information we provided in our response to the February 2001 request, and also sought a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services, as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The subpoena covered the period from May 1996 to May 2002. We provided the documents requested and cooperated with the United States Attorneys Office and the OIG in its investigation. In January 2007, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia informed us that it has 50 Table of Contents decided to close its investigation of DaVita. No charges were made against us, no fines were assessed and no mandatory policy changes were required in connection with this investigation. In February 2007, we received a request for information from the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for records relating to EPO claims submitted to Medicare. The claims relate to services provided from 2002 to 2004 by a number of our centers. The request was sent from the OIGs office in Houston, Texas. We have been in contact with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Texas, which has stated that this is a civil inquiry related to EPO claims. We are cooperating with the inquiry and will be producing the requested records. There appears to be substantial overlap between this issue, and the ongoing review of EPO utilization and claims by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. EPO utilization was also one of the subjects of the multi year investigation by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which was recently closed as described herein. To the best of our knowledge, the government has not initiated any proceeding against us in connection with this request although we cannot predict whether we will receive further inquiries or whether or when a proceeding might be initiated. Other We have received several notices of claims from commercial payors and other third parties related to historical billing practices and claims against DVA Renal Healthcare related to historical DVA Renal Healthcare billing practices and other matters covered by their settlement agreement with the Department of Justice. At least one commercial payor has filed an arbitration demand against us, as described below, and additional commercial payors have threatened litigation. We intend to defend against these claims vigorously; however, we may not be successful and these claims may lead to litigation and any such litigation may be resolved unfavorably. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted at this time, an adverse result in excess of our established reserves, with respect to one or more of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have received several informal inquiries from representatives of the New York Attorney Generals Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU) regarding certain aspects of the EPO and other billing practices taking place at facilities managed by us in New York. We are cooperating with the MFCUs informal inquiries and have provided documents and information to the MFCU. To the best of our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us and the MFCU has not indicated an intention to do so, although we cannot predict whether we will receive further inquiries or whether or when proceedings might be initiated. In June 2004, DVA Renal Healthcare was served with a complaint filed in the Superior Court of California by one of its former employees who worked for its California acute services program. The complaint, which is styled as a class action, alleges, among other things, that DVA Renal Healthcare failed to provide overtime wages, defined rest periods and meal periods, or compensation in lieu of such provisions and failed to comply with certain other California labor code requirements. We are evaluating the claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the matter. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted, we do not expect that an unfavorable result, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. On August 8, 2005, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against Gambro AB, DVA Renal Healthcare and related entities. The plaintiff sought to bring its claims as a class action on behalf of itself and all entities that paid any of the defendants for health care goods and services from on or about January 1991 through at least December 2004. The complaint alleged, among other things, damages resulting from facts and circumstances underlying DVA Renal Healthcares December 2004 settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States Government. In March 2006, the case was dismissed and the plaintiff was compelled to seek arbitration to resolve the matter. In November 2006, the plaintiff filed a demand for class arbitration against us 51 Table of Contents and DVA Renal Healthcare. At this time, we cannot estimate the potential range of damages, if any. We are investigating these claims and continue to vigorously defend ourselves in the matter. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including from time to time, contractual disputes and professional and general liability claims. We believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, variable compensation accruals and purchase accounting valuation estimates, are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize for a reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the more than 1,200 commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g, 80% for Medicare patients) and b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g, Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 103,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. 52 Table of Contents Our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk is generally expected to be within 1% of total revenue, which can represent as much as 6.5% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments, including our investments in third party dialysis businesses and our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as applicable. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually, and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are also in the process of determining the impact of implementing Financial Account Standard Interpretation (FIN) No. 48 Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties effective January 1, 2007, that requires us to assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and to also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. The valuation of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired or assumed in connection with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition required numerous assessments and assumptions, including those concerning dialysis industry trends, our companys business strategies and 53 Table of Contents plans, the strategies of present or potential competitors, the quality of our continuing relationships with physicians and teammates and the likely effects of changes in those relationships, and other competitive and market conditions including those that involve dialysis product suppliers. These assumptions include expected outcomes under different acquisition agreement terms, and as a result, involve estimates of which the ultimate accuracy will never be known. We also make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets associated with other routine acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Long lived tangible and intangible assets are subject to our regular ongoing impairment assessments. Significant new accounting standards Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payment, which amended SFAS No. 123 and 95 and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. This standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, such as stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units and discounted employee stock purchases, based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize such cost over the requisite period during which an employee provides service. The grant date fair value is to be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for unique characteristics of the equity instruments. The standard also addresses the accounting for transactions that involve the creation of a liability in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of a companys equity instruments or that may be settled through the issuance of such equity instruments. The standard does not change the accounting for transactions involving equity instruments issued for services to non employees or the accounting for employee stock ownership plans. The standard also requires that the tax benefits realized from stock award exercises in excess of the stock based compensation expenses recognizable for financial statement purposes be reported on a prospective basis as a cash flow from financing activities rather than as an operating cash flow as previously required. This reduces net operating cash flows and increases net financing cash flows for periods after adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). During 2006, we recorded $26.4 million of stock based compensation expenses including stock based compensation associated with implementing SFAS No. 123(R). In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 48 Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement attribute on all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in order to be recognized in the financial statements. In making this assessment, a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position and that the tax position will be examined by appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. Once the recognition threshold is met, the tax position is then measured to determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. In addition, the recognition threshold of more likely than not must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of the tax benefit. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. We are currently assessing the expected impact of this Interpretation on our consolidated financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we adopted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying current year financial statement misstatements. The interpretations in SAB No. 108, which expresses the SECs staff views, were issued to address the diversity in the practice of quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential under current practice for a build 54 Table of Contents up of improper amounts on the balance sheet. The SEC staff indicated that companies should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in material misstatement. The adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2006. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average rates in effect at the end of 2006 including the economic effects of our swap agreements. These rates are based on the weighted average LIBOR rates plus margins in effect that are subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio plus the economic impact from the swap agreements. The margins currently in effect range from 1.75% to 2.00%. For our interest rate swap agreements, the table below presents the notional amounts by contract maturity date and the related interest rate terms of the agreements (to pay fixed rates, and to receive LIBOR). Expected maturity date Total Fair Value Average interest rate 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 5 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 $ 0 $ 1,352 $ 1,360 $ 1,372 7.02% Variable rate $ 16 $ 54 $ 62 $ 88 $ 444 $ 1,727 $ 2,391 $ 2,391 6.61% Notionalamount Contract maturity date Pay fixed Receivevariable Fairvalue 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 (dollars in millions) Swaps: Pay fixed swaps $ 1,341 $ 373 $ 378 $ 401 $ 189 $ 0 3.08% to 4.27 % LIBOR $ 29.5 As of December 31, 2006, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $1,341 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.88%, on the hedged portion of our Credit Facility, including the term loan B margin of 2.00%. The swap agreements require quarterly interest payments, bear amortizing notional amounts, and expire in 2008 through 2010. During 2006, we accrued net cash benefits of $15.8 million from these swaps which is included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2006, the total fair value of these swaps was an asset of $29.5 million. We recorded $7.9 million, net of tax, as an increase to comprehensive income for the change in fair value of the effective portions of these swaps during 2006. At December 31, 2006, our overall Credit Facility effective weighted average interest rate was 6.61%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.76%. As a result of all of our swap agreements, we had over 56% of our outstanding variable rate debt economically fixed and approximately 72% of our total debt economically fixed as of December 31, 2006. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $6.8 million, $3.2 million, and $5.9 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. 55 Table of Contents Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk.

(2) Total operating expenses include recoveries of $5,192 in 2002 of accounts receivable reserved in 1999. 33 Table of Contents (3) Debt expense in 2006, includes the write off of approximately $3.3 million of deferred financing costs associated with our principal prepayments on the Term loans. (4) The swap valuation net gains of $4,548 in 2005, represented the accumulated fair value on several swap instruments that were ineffective as cash flow hedges, as a result of the repayment of our credit facilities, as well as changes in the fair values of these swaps until they were redesignated as hedges, and represent changes in the fair value of the swaps during periods in which there was no matching variable rate LIBOR based interest payments. (5) Refinancing charges of $8,170 in 2005 represented the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the extinguishment of our prior credit facility. Refinancing charges of $26,501 in 2003 represented the consideration paid to redeem the $125,000 5 5/8% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 and the $345,000 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 in excess of book value, the write off of related deferred financing costs and other financing fees associated with the amendment of the prior credit facility. Refinancing charges of $48,930 in 2002 represented the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the retirement of the $225,000 outstanding 9 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011. (6) During 2005, we divested a total of 71 outpatient dialysis centers in conjunction with a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission on October 4, 2005 in order for us to complete the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. In addition, we completed the sale of three additional centers that were previously pending state regulatory approval in January 2006. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested and held for sale centers were reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for 2005 and prior. (7) All share and per share data for all periods presented prior to 2005 have been adjusted to retroactively reflect the effects of a 3 for 2 stock split that occurred in the second quarter of 2004. (8) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed by dividing earnings by fixed charges. Earnings for this purpose is defined as pretax income from continuing operations adjusted by adding back fixed charges expensed during the period. Fixed charges include debt expense (interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs), the estimated interest component of rental expense on operating leases, and capitalized interest.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Forward looking statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements that do not concern historical facts are forward looking statements and include, among other things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, operating cash flow, estimated tax rates, capital expenditures, the development of new centers and center acquisitions, the impact of the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition and our level of indebtedness on our financial performance, including earnings per share, and anticipated integration costs. These statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements, including, but not limited to, risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, possible reductions in private and government payment rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York, the subpoenas from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri and DVA Renal Healthcares compliance with its corporate integrity agreement, our ability to complete and integrate acquisitions of businesses, the successful integration of DVA Renal Healthcare, including its billing and collection operations and the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,300 outpatient dialysis centers and 770 hospitals, serving approximately 103,000 patients. In October 2005, we acquired DVA Renal Healthcare, Inc., then one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, for approximately $3.06 billion. At the time of the acquisition, DVA Renal Healthcare was operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results effective October 1, 2005. In accordance with a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission on October 4, 2005, we were required to divest a total of 69 outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements in order for us to complete the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. In 2005, we divested a total of 71 centers and terminated the two management services agreements. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, we completed the sale of three additional centers that were previously pending state regulatory approval. We received total cash consideration of approximately $330 million for all of the centers divested and used approximately $13 million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture, to distribute a minority owners share of the sale proceeds, and to pay related transaction costs. We also paid approximately $85 million in related income taxes in the first quarter of 2006. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers and its one management services agreement are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for 2005 and prior. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three areas, our patients, our teammates, and our business partners, represent the major drivers of our long term 35 Table of Contents success, aside from external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes have improved over each of the past three years, and in 2006 we achieved another year of excellent clinical outcomes. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. Over the past several years we have achieved significant reductions in teammate turnover, which has been a major contributor to our performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. Our operations are presented as a single reporting segment, with approximately 98% of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis and dialysis related services, such as laboratory services (collectively dialysis revenue). Eighty two percent of our dialysis revenue is derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in 1,262 centers that we consolidate that are either wholly owned or majority owned. Other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services, which combined accounted for approximately 15% of our dialysis revenue, and the remaining 3% of our dialysis revenue was from laboratory services. Our other operations include various ancillary services and strategic initiatives consisting primarily of vascular access services, disease management services, ESRD clinical research programs, oral pharmacy services and administration services to minority owned and third party owned centers and clinics, as further described in Item 1 in this Form 10 K. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives are aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our 103,000 patients. These services generated less than 2% of our total net revenues in 2006. We currently expect to continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and anticipate that these initiatives will develop into strategically successful new business operations. However, significant changes in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may ultimately impact or continue to impact the economic viability of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes could result in a write off of some or all of our investments in these strategic initiatives. The principal drivers of our dialysis revenue are a) the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week, b) average treatment revenue and c) laboratory patient testing. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our pace of opening and acquiring new centers. Our year over year treatment volume growth was as follows: 2006 2005 Treatment growth related to: Existing and newly opened centers 4.8 % 5.4 % Other center acquisitions 4.0 % 7.5 % DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition effective 10/1/05 51.5 % 23.0 % Total treatment growth 60.3 % 35.9 % Average dialysis revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, dialysis services charge capture, and our billing and collecting operations performance. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are more than double Medicare and Medicaid payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total 36 Table of Contents average revenue per treatment. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare did not materially affect our overall patient mix percentage. The following tables summarizes our dialysis revenue and patient percentages by payor type for the year ended December 31, 2006: Revenues Patient Percentages Medicare and Medicare assigned HMO plans 58 % 78 % Medicaid 4 % 6 % Other government based programs 3 % 3 % Total government based programs 65 % 87 % Commercial 35 % 13 % Total dialysis revenue 100 % 100 % Government payment rates are principally determined by federal (Medicare) and state (Medicaid) policy. These payment rates have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of being reduced. Cumulative net increases in Medicare payment rates from 1990 through 2006 totaled approximately 9%. There were no Medicare payment rate increases for 2003 and 2004. CMS implemented increases of 1.6% on January 1, 2006 and January 1, 2005, however the 2005 increase was more than offset by other structural changes to Medicare dialysis payment rates that also became effective January 1, 2005. In addition, CMS recently approved a 1.6% increase that will be effective on April 1, 2007. Medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures. Commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are at contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Over the past three years we have been successful in maintaining relatively stable average payment rates in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases, although we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors which may result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of commercial rate increases in the future. Approximately 30% of our dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006, has been associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for approximately 25% of our dialysis revenue. Therefore, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in private and governmental payment rates significantly influence our revenue levels. Such changes, driven by physician practice patterns and protocols focused on improving clinical outcomes, accounted for a significant portion of the increase in average revenue per treatment in 2006. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services charge capture and billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past three years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. We are currently in the process of upgrading our billing and collections systems as part of the integration of DVA Renal Healthcares systems, which could adversely affect our collection performance during the transition period. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis revenue per treatment including lab services for continuing operations was $330, $323 and $322 for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Principal factors affecting our average revenue per 37 Table of Contents treatment in 2006 were increases in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue) and changes in our commercial and government payor mix, as well as changes in the intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. In 2005, the average revenue per treatment was impacted by the lower average revenue per treatment attributable to the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition that became effective on October 1, 2005, and an overall decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, offset by increases in our commercial standard fee schedules. The average revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter 2005 following the acquisition was $320 per treatment. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future. Additionally, the continuing integration process for the DVA Renal Healthcare billing system could adversely affect our collection performance during the transition period. The principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost changes, such as increased insurance costs experienced in 2004. Our average clinical hours per treatment have improved over the past three years primarily because of reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in 2004 and 2005, and federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. In 2006, our clinical hours per treatment remained stable compared to 2005, however, we did experience an increase in our labor rates per treatment as labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. For the past three years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors. In addition, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO includes volume discount and other thresholds which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to meet those thresholds. Our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare did not have a significant impact on our overall patient costs on a per treatment basis. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenues over the past three years. However, this reflects substantial increases in spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes and legal and other professional fees. We expect that these higher levels of general and administrative expenses will be sustained or possibly increased in order to support our long term initiatives, including further investments in our strategic initiatives, and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Successful resolutions of disputed Medicare billings at our Florida lab resulted in recoveries related to prior years services being recognized as current period revenue and operating income of approximately $4 million, and $8 million in 2005, and 2004, respectively. We have received all expected recoveries and will not receive any additional recoveries in the future. Outlook for 2007. We currently estimate our operating income in 2007 to be in the range of $700 $760 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, possible reductions in private and government payment rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with our physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and the subpoenas from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri and DVA Renal Healthcares compliance with its corporate integrity agreement, our ability to complete and integrate acquisitions of businesses, and the successful integration of DVA Renal Healthcare, including its billing and collection operations. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 19 for more 38 Table of Contents information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. Results of operations Following is a summary of operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. Year ended December 31, Continuing Operations 2006 2005 2004 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, except per treatment data) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 4,881 100 % $ 2,970 100 % $ 2,169 100 % Prior years services laboratory 4 8 4,881 2,974 2,177 Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 3,390 70 % 2,036 69 % 1,470 68 % General and administrative 454 9 % 272 9 % 192 9 % Depreciation and amortization 173 4 % 117 4 % 83 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 126 2 % 62 2 % 39 2 % Minority interests and equity income, net 36 1 % 22 12 Valuation gain on Product Supply Agreement (38 ) Total operating expenses and charges 4,141 85 % 2,509 85 % 1,796 83 % Operating income $ 739 15 % $ 465 16 % $ 381 17 % Dialysis treatments 14,495,796 9,044,966 6,654,069 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 46,372 28,898 21,225 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 320 $ 313 $ 313 Average dialysis revenue per treatment (including the lab) $ 330 $ 323 $ 322 The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results from October 1, 2005. Our operating income margins, excluding recoveries for prior years lab services and the valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement declined from 15.5% in 2005 to 14.4% in 2006, primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs, additional integration costs and SFAS No. 123(R) stock based compensation expense. Net operating revenues Operating revenues for current period services increased 64% in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased 37% in 2005 compared to 2004. The number of dialysis treatments accounted for approximately 57% of the increase in revenues in 2006, with approximately 49% primarily due to the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare effective on October 1, 2005 and the balance from acquisitions and growth in existing and new centers. The remaining 7% increase in total net operating revenue in 2006 was due to increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment and additional management fees and revenue from ancillary services and strategic initiatives. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare in the fourth quarter of 2005 accounted for approximately 22% of the increase in 2005, approximately 12% was due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments with the balance of approximately 3% due to additional increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment and additional lab, management fees and ancillary revenue. 39 Table of Contents Dialysis revenue, which includes dialysis services and related laboratory services, represented approximately 98%, 98% and 99% of net operating revenues in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including management fee income, accounted for the balance of our total revenues. Dialysis Services Dialysis revenue. We generate approximately 82%, 9% and 6% of our total dialysis revenue from outpatient hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and home based dialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis, respectively, and 3% of our total dialysis revenue from laboratory services. Major components of dialysis revenue include both the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents approximately 30% of total dialysis revenue, and related laboratory services, as described below. Approximately 65% of our total dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 is from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage Plans, representing approximately 87% of our total patients. Our commercial payors consist principally of commercial insurance plans, including more than 1,200 with whom we have contracted rates. Approximately 13% of our dialysis revenue is associated with non contracted commercial payors. Less than 1% of our dialysis services and related dialysis services payments are received directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 5% of total dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. On average we are paid at more than double Medicare or Medicaid rates for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans. Patients covered by employer group health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As of December 31, 2006, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $147 and $162 per treatment, or an overall average of $155 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our patient care costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. While our commercial payment rates are under downward pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers, and we expect this trend to continue into 2007, we have been successful in offsetting these pressures through successful negotiating and price increases. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. Our year over year treatment volume growth was as follows: 2006 2005 Treatment growth related to: Existing and newly opened centers 4.8 % 5.4 % Other center acquisitions 4.0 % 7.5 % DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition effective 10/1/05 51.5 % 23.0 % Total treatment growth 60.3 % 35.9 % The annual average dialysis revenue per treatment, including lab services, for continuing operations was $330, $323 and $322 for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Principal factors affecting our average revenue per treatment in 2006 were increases in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue), and changes in our commercial and government payor mix, as well as changes in the intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. In 2005, the average revenue per treatment was impacted by the lower 40 Table of Contents average revenue per treatment attributable to the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition that became effective October 1, 2005, and an overall decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, offset by increases in our commercial standard fee schedules. The average revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter of 2005 following the acquisition was $320 per treatment. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future. Additionally, the continuing integration process for the DVA Renal Healthcare billing and collections operations could adversely affect our collections through the two to three year transition period. Lab revenues. Lab revenues represented approximately 3% of our total net operating revenues for 2006 and 2005. A third party carrier review of Medicare claims associated with our Florida based laboratory was initiated in 1998. No Medicare payments were received for our lab services from the second quarter of 1998 until the third quarter of 2002 while we were appealing the Medicare payment withholds. Following a favorable administrative law judge ruling in 2002, we began receiving prior year Medicare payments in the third quarter of 2002, and received a total of approximately $83 million prior to 2004, $8 million in 2004, and $4 million in 2005. There are no further significant unresolved Medicare lab billing issues. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including management fees, represented less than 2% of our total net operating revenues for both 2006 and 2005. Management fee income. Management fee income is included as part of our revenue from ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and represented less than 1% of net operating revenues for 2006 and 2005. We operated or provided administrative services to 38 third party or minority owned dialysis centers as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. We also provided management and administrative services to 30 physician owned vascular access clinics at December 31, 2006. Our management fees are principally based on a percentage of the revenue of the managed operations, cash collections, or based upon a percentage of operating income. In January 2007, we received notice that one of our management and administrative services agreements will be terminated on November 30, 2007. As of December 31, 2006 we provided management and administrative services to 19 dialysis centers under this agreement. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and facility costs. As a percentage of current period operating revenues, patient care costs were approximately 69.5% for 2006, 68.5% for 2005 and 67.8% for 2004. On a per treatment basis, patient care costs increased year over year approximately $9 and $4 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2006 was principally due to higher labor and benefit costs, increases in expenses related to our strategic initiatives and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The increase in 2005 was principally due to higher labor and benefit costs, and to a lesser extent medical supply costs. The higher labor costs in 2006 reflect rising labor rates mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel and the effect of the increase in the number of newly opened centers, which are not yet at normal productivity levels. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers, or the direct costs associated with our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and include expenses for corporate and divisional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions, and regulatory compliance oversight. General and 41 Table of Contents administrative expenses as a percentage of current period operating revenues were 9.3%, 9.2%, and 8.9% in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expense for 2006 was primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives and government investigations, integration costs associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition and stock based compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R). The increase in general and administrative expense for 2005 was primarily due to infrastructure costs for expanding business operations, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives and government investigations, higher labor costs, and integration costs associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was approximately 4% of current period operating revenues for each of the past three years. The absolute dollar increase in depreciation and amortization in 2006 was due to additional centers from acquisitions and newly opened centers, amortization of intangible assets associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, offset by the amortization of the Product Supply Agreement as described below. Provision for uncollectible accounts. As a result of the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition and the higher historical provision rate for DVA Renal Healthcare, the post acquisition average provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2005. This rate was consistently maintained in 2006 and is expected to remain stable in 2007. The provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately 2.1% of current period operating revenues for the full year 2005, and 1.8% for 2004. Minority interests and equity income, net. Minority interests net of equity income increased to approximately $36 million in 2006, an increase of approximately $14 million over 2005. The increase was primarily due to an increase in new centers having minority partners as well as growth in the earnings of our joint ventures. Product Supply Agreement. On May 29, 2006, we notified Gambro Renal Products Inc. (Gambro Renal Products) that we were terminating the Alliance and Product Supply Agreement (the Product Supply Agreement) with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products. The Product Supply Agreement was entered into on October 5, 2005, in conjunction with our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare and committed us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products supplies and equipment at fixed prices. Our termination notice claimed a material breach by Gambro Renal Products for failure to perform its obligations under the Product Supply Agreement, primarily as a result of an import ban issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration affecting certain hemodialysis products. On August 25, 2006, we entered into an amended and restated Product Supply Agreement (the Amended Supply Agreement), with Gambro Renal Products and Gambro AB. The Amended Supply Agreement effectively revoked our notice of termination of the Product Supply Agreement. The Amended Supply Agreement, among other things, relieves us of certain obligations, including releasing us from the purchase requirements for certain affected products during the import ban, permits us to secure alternate sources of supplies for the products affected by the import ban, reduces our purchase obligations for certain hemodialysis product supplies and equipment and also allows for the termination of the purchase obligations for equipment affected by the import ban if the import ban is not lifted by June 30, 2007. As a result of the reductions in the amount of purchase obligations that are now required under the Amended Supply Agreement, we recorded a net valuation gain of approximately $38.0 million. This valuation gain represents the difference in the fair value between the Product Supply Agreement and the Amended Supply Agreement, as of the effective date of the amendment. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses, and our ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a 42 Table of Contents review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. Debt expense Debt expense for 2006, 2005, and 2004 consisted of interest expense of approximately $263 million, $134 million, and $50 million, respectively, amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $10 million in 2006, $5 million in 2005, and $2 million in 2004, and in 2006, included the write off of approximately $3.3 million of deferred financing costs associated with the principal prepayments on our term loans. The increase in interest expense in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to additional borrowings outstanding during 2006 under our credit facility, the increase in the average outstanding balances of our senior and senior subordinated notes, which were issued in March 2005, and increases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. The increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to borrowings under our credit facility in connection with the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare that was effective October 1, 2005, increases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates and issuance of our new senior and senior subordinated notes that have average fixed interest rates of approximately 7.0%, offset by changes in our LIBOR based receipts from swap settlements. Other income Other income, which was a net of approximately $13 million, $9 million, and $4 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, consisted principally of interest income. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2006 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 39.2%, compared with 37.4% and 38.6% in 2005 and 2004 respectively. The changes in the effective tax rates were primarily due to state income taxes and tax valuation allowance adjustments. We currently project that the effective income tax rate for 2007 will be in the range of 39.5% to 40%. Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2006 and 2005 represented approximately 70 and 71 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt provision. The relative decrease in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2006 was a result of improved cash collections. As of December 31, 2006 approximately $50 million in unreserved accounts receivable, representing approximately 5% of our total accounts receivable balance, were more than six months old. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than one half of 1% of our treatments are classified as patient pay. Virtually all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, other than the standard monthly processing, consisted of approximately $16 million and $24 million, respectively, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Our Medicare bad debt claims are typically not paid to us until the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims, and such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements except for potentially limiting the collectibility of Medicare bad debt claims. 43 Table of Contents DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition On October 5, 2005, we completed our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, Inc. from Gambro, Inc. under a Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 6, 2004, for $3.06 billion. DVA Renal Healthcare was one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers serving approximately 43,000 patients and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our consolidated financial statements from October 1, 2005. Divestitures per Federal Trade Commission Consent Order. As a condition of completing the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, we were required by the Federal Trade Commission to divest a total of 69 outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements. On October 6, 2005, DaVita and DVA Renal Healthcare completed the sale of 71 outpatient renal dialysis centers, and terminated the two management services agreements. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, we completed the sale of three additional centers to Renal Advantage, Inc. that were previously pending state regulatory approval in Illinois. We received total cash consideration of approximately $330 million for all of the centers divested and used approximately $13 million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture, to distribute a minority owners share of the sale proceeds, and to pay related transaction costs. We also paid related income taxes of approximately $85 million on these divestitures during the first quarter of 2006. As part of this transaction, Renal Advantage assumed specific liabilities related to the centers and all other liabilities were retained by us. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers are accounted for as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for 2005 and prior. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2006 our cash balance was $310 million and we had undrawn credit facilities totaling $253.6 million, ($250 million with our senior secured credit facility and $3.6 million associated with several joint ventures) of which approximately $50 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2006 amounted to $520 million, compared with $486 million for 2005. Cash flow from operations in 2006 included an income tax payment of approximately $85 million associated with divestitures of certain centers in conjunction with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition and also included cash interest payments of approximately $272 million reflecting our higher outstanding debt balances as a result of the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. Cash interest payments in 2005 were approximately $86 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2006 included $263 million for capital asset expenditures, including $143 million for new center developments and an additional $87 million for acquisitions. We also received in 2006 approximately $22 million from the sale of discontinued operations and asset sales. Non operating cash outflows in 2005 included $161 million for capital asset expenditures, including $93 million for new center developments, and an additional $3,202 million for acquisitions. We also received in 2005 approximately $299 million from the sale of discontinued operations. During 2006, we acquired a total of 26 dialysis centers, including two centers that we previously held a minority owned interest, opened 55 new dialysis centers and divested, sold or closed 14 centers. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare in the fourth quarter of 2005 resulted in the net addition of 492 dialysis centers after related divestitures. We acquired 54 other dialysis centers and opened 46 new dialysis centers during 2005. We currently expect to spend approximately $110 million to $120 million for general maintenance capital asset expenditures in 2007, and approximately $200 million to $220 million for new center development, relocations and center acquisitions. Our current projections include opening approximately the same number of 44 Table of Contents centers in 2007 that we opened in 2006. We expect to generate approximately $440 million to $510 million of operating cash flow in 2007. 2006 capital structure changes and other capital items. During 2006, we made principal payments totaling $62 million on the term loan A and $338 million on the term loan B which included mandatory principal payments of $35 million and $24.5 million respectively. All of the mandatory principal payments were paid in advance of the scheduled payment dates in 2006. Because of the principal prepayments, our next mandatory principal payments are $12.4 million in 2007, $52.5 million in 2008, $61.3 million in 2009, $87.5 million in 2010, and $65.6 million in 2011, for the term loan A and $379 million in 2011 and $1,727 million in 2012, for the term loan B. As a result of the principal prepayment made in 2006, we wrote off approximately $3.3 million of deferred financing costs, which is included in debt expense. On March 1, 2006, our interest rate margins on our term loan A and term loan B (collectively, the Credit Facility), were reduced by 0.25% as a result of achieving certain financial ratios as defined in the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2006, the term loan A bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% and the term loan B bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%. The margins are subject to adjustment depending upon changes in our financial ratios and can range from 1.50% to 2.25% for the revolving credit facility and term loan A, and 2.00% to 2.25% for the term loan B. Our credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and requires compliance with certain financial covenants, including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio that determine the interest rate margins described above. The credit agreement also contains limits on the annual amount of expenditures for acquisitions and capital improvements. Our senior and senior subordinated notes consist of $500 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. As of December 31, 2006, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $1,341 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.88%, on the hedged portion of our Credit Facility, including the term loan B margin of 2.00%. The swap agreements require quarterly interest payments, bear amortizing notional amounts, and expire in 2008 through 2010. During 2006, we accrued net cash benefits of $15.8 million from these swaps which is included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2006, the total fair value of these swaps was an asset of $29.5 million. We recorded $7.9 million, net of tax, as an increase to comprehensive income for the change in fair value of the effective portions of these swaps during 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 56% of our variable rate debt and approximately 72% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements at December 31, 2006, our overall effective weighted average interest rate on the Credit Facility was 6.61%, based upon the current margins in effect ranging from 1.75% to 2.00%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.76%. On February 23, 2007, we issued $400 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 in a private offering. These senior notes are part of the same series of debt securities as the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% senior notes that were issued in March 2005. The senior notes are guaranteed by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments beginning March 15, 2007. The senior notes may be redeemed in whole or part at any time on or after March 15, 2009, at certain specified prices. We used the proceeds to pay down our term loan B and also wrote off approximately $4 million of term loan B deferred financing costs. 45 Table of Contents On February 23, 2007, we amended and restated our existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities to, among other things, reduce the interest rate margin on our term loan B by 0.50%, and to amend certain covenants. The new term loan B will bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%. If we refinance the term loan B prior to February 23, 2008, we will be subject to a prepayment penalty of 1.0%, otherwise the payment terms remain the same. In addition, the amount by which we can elect to increase the revolving and term loan commitments was changed from $500 million to $750 million. On February 7, 2007, we entered into a National Provider Agreement with NxStage, Inc. The agreement provides us the ability to purchase NxStage home based hemodialysis products at a potential discount depending upon the achievement of certain volume targets. The agreement has an initial term of three years, terminating on December 31, 2009, and may be extended in six month increments up to two additional years if certain volume targets are met. As a part of the agreement, we purchased outright all of our NxStage System One equipment currently in use for $5.1 million, and will purchase a majority of our future home based hemodialysis equipment and supplies from NxStage. In connection with the provider agreement, we purchased 2 million shares of NxStage common stock in a private placement offering for $20 million, representing an ownership position of approximately 7%. In connection with the purchase of the shares, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement under which NxStage has agreed to register the shares. Stock based compensation Effective January 1, 2006, we implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R) Share Based Payment, which requires the measurement and recognition of cost for all stock based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, and discounted employee stock purchases. Under SFAS No. 123 (R) our stock based compensation awards are measured at estimated fair value on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense over their requisite service periods. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes our previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, under which we did not recognize compensation expense for most of our stock options. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 relating to the application of SFAS No. 123(R), and we have applied the provisions of SAB No. 107 in our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We implemented SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. In accordance with this method, our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to fiscal year 2006 have not been restated to reflect this change. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires that tax benefits realized from stock award exercise gains in excess of stock based compensation expense recognized for financial statement purposes be reported as cash flows from financing activities rather than as operating cash flows. We also elected to use the method available under FASB Staff Position FSP No. 123(R) 3 Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards, which provides an alternative method for calculating historical excess tax benefits from the method described in SFAS No. 123(R) for stock based compensation awards. Under SFAS No. 123(R), stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of the stock based award vesting during that period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for 2006 includes compensation cost for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of, December 31, 2005 and stock based awards granted in 2006. We previously recognized the effect of stock unit forfeitures as they occurred, and the effect of transitioning to recognition of expense based on expected forfeitures was insignificant. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in 2006, as well as for stock option grants during all prior periods. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized $26.4 million in stock based compensation expense for stock options, stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock units and discounted employee stock plan 46 Table of Contents purchases, which is primarily included in general and administrative expenses in continuing operations. The estimated tax benefit recorded for this stock based compensation was $9.7 million. As of December 31, 2006, there was $67.7 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.7 years. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we received $37.9 million in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $40.4 million in actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. 2005 capital structure changes. On October 5, 2005, we entered into a credit agreement allowing for borrowings of up to $3.05 billion. The facilities under the credit agreement consist of a $250 million six year revolving credit facility, a $350 million six year term loan A facility and a $2,450 million seven year term loan B facility (the Facilities). Existing borrowings under the Facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus margins initially ranging from 2.00% to 2.25%. The margins are subject to adjustment depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios and can range from 1.50% to 2.25% for the revolving credit facility and the term loan A, and 2.00% to 2.25% for the term loan B. The Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets. The credit agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and requires compliance with financial covenants, including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio that determine the interest rate margins described above. The aggregate amount of the Facilities may be increased by up to $500 million as long as no default exists or would result from such increase and we remain in compliance with the financial covenants after such increase. Such additional loans would be on substantially the same terms as the original borrowings under the Facilities. On October 5, 2005, we borrowed $2,850 million under the Facilities ($50 million on the revolving credit facility, $350 million on the term loan A and $2,450 million on term loan B), and used these borrowings, along with available cash of $252 million, to purchase DVA Renal Healthcare and pay related bank fees and expenses of approximately $47 million and to pay fees and expenses in connection with terminating our then existing credit facility. On October 7, 2005, we repaid the $50 million of the revolving credit facility with proceeds from the sale of the divested centers. On March 22, 2005, we issued $500 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015 and incurred related deferred financing costs of $28.6 million. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, and require semi annual interest payments. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. We used the net proceeds of $1,323 million along with available cash of $46 million to repay all outstanding amounts under the term loan portions of our then existing credit facilities, including accrued interest. In conjunction with the repayment and extinguishment of our prior credit facilities during 2005, we wrote off deferred financing costs of $8.2 million and reclassified into net income $8.1 million of swap valuation gains that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. These gains represented the accumulated fair value of several interest rate swap instruments that became ineffective as cash flow hedges as a result of the repayment of our prior credit facilities. In addition we recorded a net loss of $2.1 million related to changes in fair values of these swaps that were not effective as interest rate hedges until they were redesignated in the second quarter of 2005. Portions of our various interest rate swap agreements that were previously designated and expected to be effective as forward cash flow hedges became ineffective as a result of us not having any variable rate LIBOR based interest payments during a portion of 2005. This resulted in a net charge of $1.7 million to swap valuation gains, which includes the $1.5 million discussed below as well as a reclassification into income of $2.0 million of swap valuation losses that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. The swap payment periods 47 Table of Contents that began after October 2005 were highly effective cash flow hedges with gains or losses from changes in their fair values reported in other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2005, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1,580 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 6.1%, which included the term loan B margin of 2.25%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2005, we incurred net cash obligations of approximately $1.8 million from these swaps, $0.3 million of which is included in debt expense and $1.5 million of which is included in swap valuation gains. As of December 31, 2005, the total fair value of these swaps was an asset of approximately $30.8 million. Also during 2005, we recorded $16.8 million, net of tax, of additional comprehensive income for the changes in fair value of the effective portions of these swaps. At December 31, 2005, our overall credit facility weighted average effective interest rate was 6.62%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.74%. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 55% of our variable rate debt and approximately 70% of our total debt economically fixed. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers, in the form of put provisions in joint venture agreements, which are exercisable at the third party owners future discretion. These put provisions, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the equity interest put to us. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several other third party owned centers, minority owned centers and physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under administrative services agreements. 48 Table of Contents The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2006 (in millions): Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 18 $ 117 $ 532 $ 3,077 $ 3,744 Interest payments on senior and senior subordinated notes 95 190 190 264 739 Capital lease obligations 3 1 1 2 7 Operating leases 148 258 198 294 898 $ 264 $ 566 $ 921 $ 3,637 $ 5,388 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 50 $ 50 Acquisition of dialysis centers 100 38 33 21 192 Working capital advances to third parties under administrative services agreements 11 11 $ 161 $ 38 $ 33 $ 21 $ 253 Not included above are interest payments related to our credit facilities. Our credit facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus margins ranging from 1.75% and 2.00% and are adjustable depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2006 our credit facilities had an overall effective weighted average interest rate of 6.61%. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific debt tranches within each Term Loan, which can range in maturity from one month to twelve months. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of mandatory principal payments and principal prepayments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no principal prepayments on our credit facilities during 2007 and no changes in the effective interest rate during 2007, approximately $158 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2007. In addition to the above commitments, we entered into an Alliance and Product Supply Agreement on October 5, 2005, with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. in conjunction with our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare that committed us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices over the next ten years. The Alliance and Product Supply Agreement was amended on August 25, 2006 to reduce our purchase obligations for certain hemodialysis product supplies and equipment and to allow for the termination of purchase obligations for certain equipment currently affected by an import ban issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration if the import ban is not lifted by June 30, 2007. The amended supply agreement continues to require us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis product supplies and equipment at fixed prices. Our total expenditures in 2006 on such products were approximately 4% of our total operating costs. The actual amount of purchases in future years under the amended supply agreement will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating and capital requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs and Gambro Renal Products ability to have the import ban lifted by June 30, 2007. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the valuation of this commitment. Contingencies The majority of our revenues are from government programs and may be subject to adjustment as a result of: (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; and (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental 49 Table of Contents requirements. In addition, our revenues from commercial payors may be subject to adjustment as a result of potential claims for refunds from commercial payors, as a result of government actions or as a result of other claims by commercial payors. United States Attorney inquiries On March 4, 2005, we received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office, or U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. The subpoena requires production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including documents related to, among other things, pharmaceutical and other services provided to patients, relationships with pharmaceutical companies, and financial relationships with physicians and joint ventures. The subpoena covers the period from December 1, 1996 through the present. In October 2005, we received a follow up request for additional documents related to specific medical director and joint venture arrangements. In February 2006, we received an additional subpoena for documents, including certain patient records relating to the administration and billing of Epogen (EPO). We are producing documents and providing information to the government. We are also cooperating, and intend to continue to cooperate, with the governments investigation, including by participating in discussions and meetings with the government. The subpoenas have been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as this to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoenas will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. On October 25, 2004, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. The subpoena covers the period from 1996 to present and requires the production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including DaVita Laboratory Services. The subpoena also includes specific requests for documents relating to testing for parathyroid hormone levels (PTH), and to products relating to vitamin D therapies. The subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and DVA Renal Healthcare, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena, including Fresenius Medical Group, Renal Care Group and DVA Renal Healthcare, which was acquired by us in October of 2005. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us or DVA Renal Healthcare at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoena may continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. In February 2001, the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of our historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians. We cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the U.S. Attorneys Office. In May 2002, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office and the Philadelphia Office of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG). The subpoena required an update to the information we provided in our response to the February 2001 request, and also sought a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services, as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The subpoena covered the period from May 1996 to May 2002. We provided the documents requested and cooperated with the United States Attorneys Office and the OIG in its investigation. In January 2007, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia informed us that it has 50 Table of Contents decided to close its investigation of DaVita. No charges were made against us, no fines were assessed and no mandatory policy changes were required in connection with this investigation. In February 2007, we received a request for information from the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for records relating to EPO claims submitted to Medicare. The claims relate to services provided from 2002 to 2004 by a number of our centers. The request was sent from the OIGs office in Houston, Texas. We have been in contact with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Texas, which has stated that this is a civil inquiry related to EPO claims. We are cooperating with the inquiry and will be producing the requested records. There appears to be substantial overlap between this issue, and the ongoing review of EPO utilization and claims by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. EPO utilization was also one of the subjects of the multi year investigation by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which was recently closed as described herein. To the best of our knowledge, the government has not initiated any proceeding against us in connection with this request although we cannot predict whether we will receive further inquiries or whether or when a proceeding might be initiated. Other We have received several notices of claims from commercial payors and other third parties related to historical billing practices and claims against DVA Renal Healthcare related to historical DVA Renal Healthcare billing practices and other matters covered by their settlement agreement with the Department of Justice. At least one commercial payor has filed an arbitration demand against us, as described below, and additional commercial payors have threatened litigation. We intend to defend against these claims vigorously; however, we may not be successful and these claims may lead to litigation and any such litigation may be resolved unfavorably. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted at this time, an adverse result in excess of our established reserves, with respect to one or more of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have received several informal inquiries from representatives of the New York Attorney Generals Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU) regarding certain aspects of the EPO and other billing practices taking place at facilities managed by us in New York. We are cooperating with the MFCUs informal inquiries and have provided documents and information to the MFCU. To the best of our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us and the MFCU has not indicated an intention to do so, although we cannot predict whether we will receive further inquiries or whether or when proceedings might be initiated. In June 2004, DVA Renal Healthcare was served with a complaint filed in the Superior Court of California by one of its former employees who worked for its California acute services program. The complaint, which is styled as a class action, alleges, among other things, that DVA Renal Healthcare failed to provide overtime wages, defined rest periods and meal periods, or compensation in lieu of such provisions and failed to comply with certain other California labor code requirements. We are evaluating the claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the matter. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted, we do not expect that an unfavorable result, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. On August 8, 2005, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against Gambro AB, DVA Renal Healthcare and related entities. The plaintiff sought to bring its claims as a class action on behalf of itself and all entities that paid any of the defendants for health care goods and services from on or about January 1991 through at least December 2004. The complaint alleged, among other things, damages resulting from facts and circumstances underlying DVA Renal Healthcares December 2004 settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States Government. In March 2006, the case was dismissed and the plaintiff was compelled to seek arbitration to resolve the matter. In November 2006, the plaintiff filed a demand for class arbitration against us 51 Table of Contents and DVA Renal Healthcare. At this time, we cannot estimate the potential range of damages, if any. We are investigating these claims and continue to vigorously defend ourselves in the matter. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including from time to time, contractual disputes and professional and general liability claims. We believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, variable compensation accruals and purchase accounting valuation estimates, are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize for a reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the more than 1,200 commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g, 80% for Medicare patients) and b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g, Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 103,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. 52 Table of Contents Our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk is generally expected to be within 1% of total revenue, which can represent as much as 6.5% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments, including our investments in third party dialysis businesses and our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as applicable. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually, and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are also in the process of determining the impact of implementing Financial Account Standard Interpretation (FIN) No. 48 Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties effective January 1, 2007, that requires us to assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and to also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. The valuation of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired or assumed in connection with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition required numerous assessments and assumptions, including those concerning dialysis industry trends, our companys business strategies and 53 Table of Contents plans, the strategies of present or potential competitors, the quality of our continuing relationships with physicians and teammates and the likely effects of changes in those relationships, and other competitive and market conditions including those that involve dialysis product suppliers. These assumptions include expected outcomes under different acquisition agreement terms, and as a result, involve estimates of which the ultimate accuracy will never be known. We also make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets associated with other routine acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Long lived tangible and intangible assets are subject to our regular ongoing impairment assessments. Significant new accounting standards Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payment, which amended SFAS No. 123 and 95 and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. This standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, such as stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units and discounted employee stock purchases, based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize such cost over the requisite period during which an employee provides service. The grant date fair value is to be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for unique characteristics of the equity instruments. The standard also addresses the accounting for transactions that involve the creation of a liability in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of a companys equity instruments or that may be settled through the issuance of such equity instruments. The standard does not change the accounting for transactions involving equity instruments issued for services to non employees or the accounting for employee stock ownership plans. The standard also requires that the tax benefits realized from stock award exercises in excess of the stock based compensation expenses recognizable for financial statement purposes be reported on a prospective basis as a cash flow from financing activities rather than as an operating cash flow as previously required. This reduces net operating cash flows and increases net financing cash flows for periods after adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). During 2006, we recorded $26.4 million of stock based compensation expenses including stock based compensation associated with implementing SFAS No. 123(R). In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 48 Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement attribute on all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in order to be recognized in the financial statements. In making this assessment, a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position and that the tax position will be examined by appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. Once the recognition threshold is met, the tax position is then measured to determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. In addition, the recognition threshold of more likely than not must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of the tax benefit. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. We are currently assessing the expected impact of this Interpretation on our consolidated financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we adopted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying current year financial statement misstatements. The interpretations in SAB No. 108, which expresses the SECs staff views, were issued to address the diversity in the practice of quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential under current practice for a build 54 Table of Contents up of improper amounts on the balance sheet. The SEC staff indicated that companies should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in material misstatement. The adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2006. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average rates in effect at the end of 2006 including the economic effects of our swap agreements. These rates are based on the weighted average LIBOR rates plus margins in effect that are subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio plus the economic impact from the swap agreements. The margins currently in effect range from 1.75% to 2.00%. For our interest rate swap agreements, the table below presents the notional amounts by contract maturity date and the related interest rate terms of the agreements (to pay fixed rates, and to receive LIBOR). Expected maturity date Total Fair Value Average interest rate 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 5 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 $ 0 $ 1,352 $ 1,360 $ 1,372 7.02% Variable rate $ 16 $ 54 $ 62 $ 88 $ 444 $ 1,727 $ 2,391 $ 2,391 6.61% Notionalamount Contract maturity date Pay fixed Receivevariable Fairvalue 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 (dollars in millions) Swaps: Pay fixed swaps $ 1,341 $ 373 $ 378 $ 401 $ 189 $ 0 3.08% to 4.27 % LIBOR $ 29.5 As of December 31, 2006, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $1,341 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.88%, on the hedged portion of our Credit Facility, including the term loan B margin of 2.00%. The swap agreements require quarterly interest payments, bear amortizing notional amounts, and expire in 2008 through 2010. During 2006, we accrued net cash benefits of $15.8 million from these swaps which is included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2006, the total fair value of these swaps was an asset of $29.5 million. We recorded $7.9 million, net of tax, as an increase to comprehensive income for the change in fair value of the effective portions of these swaps during 2006. At December 31, 2006, our overall Credit Facility effective weighted average interest rate was 6.61%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.76%. As a result of all of our swap agreements, we had over 56% of our outstanding variable rate debt economically fixed and approximately 72% of our total debt economically fixed as of December 31, 2006. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $6.8 million, $3.2 million, and $5.9 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. 55 Table of Contents Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk.

We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,300 outpatient dialysis centers and 770 hospitals, serving approximately 103,000 patients. In October 2005, we acquired DVA Renal Healthcare, Inc., then one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, for approximately $3.06 billion. At the time of the acquisition, DVA Renal Healthcare was operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results effective October 1, 2005. In accordance with a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission on October 4, 2005, we were required to divest a total of 69 outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements in order for us to complete the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. In 2005, we divested a total of 71 centers and terminated the two management services agreements. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, we completed the sale of three additional centers that were previously pending state regulatory approval. We received total cash consideration of approximately $330 million for all of the centers divested and used approximately $13 million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture, to distribute a minority owners share of the sale proceeds, and to pay related transaction costs. We also paid approximately $85 million in related income taxes in the first quarter of 2006. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers and its one management services agreement are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for 2005 and prior. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three areas, our patients, our teammates, and our business partners, represent the major drivers of our long term 35 Table of Contents success, aside from external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes have improved over each of the past three years, and in 2006 we achieved another year of excellent clinical outcomes. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. Over the past several years we have achieved significant reductions in teammate turnover, which has been a major contributor to our performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. Our operations are presented as a single reporting segment, with approximately 98% of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis and dialysis related services, such as laboratory services (collectively dialysis revenue). Eighty two percent of our dialysis revenue is derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in 1,262 centers that we consolidate that are either wholly owned or majority owned. Other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services, which combined accounted for approximately 15% of our dialysis revenue, and the remaining 3% of our dialysis revenue was from laboratory services. Our other operations include various ancillary services and strategic initiatives consisting primarily of vascular access services, disease management services, ESRD clinical research programs, oral pharmacy services and administration services to minority owned and third party owned centers and clinics, as further described in Item 1 in this Form 10 K. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives are aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our 103,000 patients. These services generated less than 2% of our total net revenues in 2006. We currently expect to continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and anticipate that these initiatives will develop into strategically successful new business operations. However, significant changes in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may ultimately impact or continue to impact the economic viability of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes could result in a write off of some or all of our investments in these strategic initiatives. The principal drivers of our dialysis revenue are a) the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week, b) average treatment revenue and c) laboratory patient testing. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our pace of opening and acquiring new centers. Our year over year treatment volume growth was as follows: 2006 2005 Treatment growth related to: Existing and newly opened centers 4.8 % 5.4 % Other center acquisitions 4.0 % 7.5 % DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition effective 10/1/05 51.5 % 23.0 % Total treatment growth 60.3 % 35.9 % Average dialysis revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, dialysis services charge capture, and our billing and collecting operations performance. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are more than double Medicare and Medicaid payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total 36 Table of Contents average revenue per treatment. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare did not materially affect our overall patient mix percentage. The following tables summarizes our dialysis revenue and patient percentages by payor type for the year ended December 31, 2006: Revenues Patient Percentages Medicare and Medicare assigned HMO plans 58 % 78 % Medicaid 4 % 6 % Other government based programs 3 % 3 % Total government based programs 65 % 87 % Commercial 35 % 13 % Total dialysis revenue 100 % 100 % Government payment rates are principally determined by federal (Medicare) and state (Medicaid) policy. These payment rates have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of being reduced. Cumulative net increases in Medicare payment rates from 1990 through 2006 totaled approximately 9%. There were no Medicare payment rate increases for 2003 and 2004. CMS implemented increases of 1.6% on January 1, 2006 and January 1, 2005, however the 2005 increase was more than offset by other structural changes to Medicare dialysis payment rates that also became effective January 1, 2005. In addition, CMS recently approved a 1.6% increase that will be effective on April 1, 2007. Medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures. Commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are at contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Over the past three years we have been successful in maintaining relatively stable average payment rates in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases, although we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors which may result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of commercial rate increases in the future. Approximately 30% of our dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006, has been associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for approximately 25% of our dialysis revenue. Therefore, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in private and governmental payment rates significantly influence our revenue levels. Such changes, driven by physician practice patterns and protocols focused on improving clinical outcomes, accounted for a significant portion of the increase in average revenue per treatment in 2006. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services charge capture and billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past three years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. We are currently in the process of upgrading our billing and collections systems as part of the integration of DVA Renal Healthcares systems, which could adversely affect our collection performance during the transition period. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis revenue per treatment including lab services for continuing operations was $330, $323 and $322 for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Principal factors affecting our average revenue per 37 Table of Contents treatment in 2006 were increases in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue) and changes in our commercial and government payor mix, as well as changes in the intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. In 2005, the average revenue per treatment was impacted by the lower average revenue per treatment attributable to the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition that became effective on October 1, 2005, and an overall decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, offset by increases in our commercial standard fee schedules. The average revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter 2005 following the acquisition was $320 per treatment. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future. Additionally, the continuing integration process for the DVA Renal Healthcare billing system could adversely affect our collection performance during the transition period. The principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost changes, such as increased insurance costs experienced in 2004. Our average clinical hours per treatment have improved over the past three years primarily because of reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in 2004 and 2005, and federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. In 2006, our clinical hours per treatment remained stable compared to 2005, however, we did experience an increase in our labor rates per treatment as labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. For the past three years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors. In addition, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO includes volume discount and other thresholds which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to meet those thresholds. Our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare did not have a significant impact on our overall patient costs on a per treatment basis. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenues over the past three years. However, this reflects substantial increases in spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes and legal and other professional fees. We expect that these higher levels of general and administrative expenses will be sustained or possibly increased in order to support our long term initiatives, including further investments in our strategic initiatives, and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Successful resolutions of disputed Medicare billings at our Florida lab resulted in recoveries related to prior years services being recognized as current period revenue and operating income of approximately $4 million, and $8 million in 2005, and 2004, respectively. We have received all expected recoveries and will not receive any additional recoveries in the future. Outlook for 2007. We currently estimate our operating income in 2007 to be in the range of $700 $760 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, possible reductions in private and government payment rates, changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with our physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and the subpoenas from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri and DVA Renal Healthcares compliance with its corporate integrity agreement, our ability to complete and integrate acquisitions of businesses, and the successful integration of DVA Renal Healthcare, including its billing and collection operations. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 19 for more 38 Table of Contents information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. Results of operations Following is a summary of operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. Year ended December 31, Continuing Operations 2006 2005 2004 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, except per treatment data) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 4,881 100 % $ 2,970 100 % $ 2,169 100 % Prior years services laboratory 4 8 4,881 2,974 2,177 Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 3,390 70 % 2,036 69 % 1,470 68 % General and administrative 454 9 % 272 9 % 192 9 % Depreciation and amortization 173 4 % 117 4 % 83 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 126 2 % 62 2 % 39 2 % Minority interests and equity income, net 36 1 % 22 12 Valuation gain on Product Supply Agreement (38 ) Total operating expenses and charges 4,141 85 % 2,509 85 % 1,796 83 % Operating income $ 739 15 % $ 465 16 % $ 381 17 % Dialysis treatments 14,495,796 9,044,966 6,654,069 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 46,372 28,898 21,225 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 320 $ 313 $ 313 Average dialysis revenue per treatment (including the lab) $ 330 $ 323 $ 322 The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results from October 1, 2005. Our operating income margins, excluding recoveries for prior years lab services and the valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement declined from 15.5% in 2005 to 14.4% in 2006, primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs, additional integration costs and SFAS No. 123(R) stock based compensation expense. Net operating revenues Operating revenues for current period services increased 64% in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased 37% in 2005 compared to 2004. The number of dialysis treatments accounted for approximately 57% of the increase in revenues in 2006, with approximately 49% primarily due to the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare effective on October 1, 2005 and the balance from acquisitions and growth in existing and new centers. The remaining 7% increase in total net operating revenue in 2006 was due to increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment and additional management fees and revenue from ancillary services and strategic initiatives. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare in the fourth quarter of 2005 accounted for approximately 22% of the increase in 2005, approximately 12% was due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments with the balance of approximately 3% due to additional increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment and additional lab, management fees and ancillary revenue. 39 Table of Contents Dialysis revenue, which includes dialysis services and related laboratory services, represented approximately 98%, 98% and 99% of net operating revenues in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including management fee income, accounted for the balance of our total revenues. Dialysis Services Dialysis revenue. We generate approximately 82%, 9% and 6% of our total dialysis revenue from outpatient hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and home based dialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis, respectively, and 3% of our total dialysis revenue from laboratory services. Major components of dialysis revenue include both the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents approximately 30% of total dialysis revenue, and related laboratory services, as described below. Approximately 65% of our total dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 is from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage Plans, representing approximately 87% of our total patients. Our commercial payors consist principally of commercial insurance plans, including more than 1,200 with whom we have contracted rates. Approximately 13% of our dialysis revenue is associated with non contracted commercial payors. Less than 1% of our dialysis services and related dialysis services payments are received directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 5% of total dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. On average we are paid at more than double Medicare or Medicaid rates for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans. Patients covered by employer group health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As of December 31, 2006, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $147 and $162 per treatment, or an overall average of $155 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our patient care costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. While our commercial payment rates are under downward pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers, and we expect this trend to continue into 2007, we have been successful in offsetting these pressures through successful negotiating and price increases. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. Our year over year treatment volume growth was as follows: 2006 2005 Treatment growth related to: Existing and newly opened centers 4.8 % 5.4 % Other center acquisitions 4.0 % 7.5 % DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition effective 10/1/05 51.5 % 23.0 % Total treatment growth 60.3 % 35.9 % The annual average dialysis revenue per treatment, including lab services, for continuing operations was $330, $323 and $322 for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Principal factors affecting our average revenue per treatment in 2006 were increases in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue), and changes in our commercial and government payor mix, as well as changes in the intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. In 2005, the average revenue per treatment was impacted by the lower 40 Table of Contents average revenue per treatment attributable to the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition that became effective October 1, 2005, and an overall decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, offset by increases in our commercial standard fee schedules. The average revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter of 2005 following the acquisition was $320 per treatment. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future. Additionally, the continuing integration process for the DVA Renal Healthcare billing and collections operations could adversely affect our collections through the two to three year transition period. Lab revenues. Lab revenues represented approximately 3% of our total net operating revenues for 2006 and 2005. A third party carrier review of Medicare claims associated with our Florida based laboratory was initiated in 1998. No Medicare payments were received for our lab services from the second quarter of 1998 until the third quarter of 2002 while we were appealing the Medicare payment withholds. Following a favorable administrative law judge ruling in 2002, we began receiving prior year Medicare payments in the third quarter of 2002, and received a total of approximately $83 million prior to 2004, $8 million in 2004, and $4 million in 2005. There are no further significant unresolved Medicare lab billing issues. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including management fees, represented less than 2% of our total net operating revenues for both 2006 and 2005. Management fee income. Management fee income is included as part of our revenue from ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and represented less than 1% of net operating revenues for 2006 and 2005. We operated or provided administrative services to 38 third party or minority owned dialysis centers as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. We also provided management and administrative services to 30 physician owned vascular access clinics at December 31, 2006. Our management fees are principally based on a percentage of the revenue of the managed operations, cash collections, or based upon a percentage of operating income. In January 2007, we received notice that one of our management and administrative services agreements will be terminated on November 30, 2007. As of December 31, 2006 we provided management and administrative services to 19 dialysis centers under this agreement. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and facility costs. As a percentage of current period operating revenues, patient care costs were approximately 69.5% for 2006, 68.5% for 2005 and 67.8% for 2004. On a per treatment basis, patient care costs increased year over year approximately $9 and $4 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2006 was principally due to higher labor and benefit costs, increases in expenses related to our strategic initiatives and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The increase in 2005 was principally due to higher labor and benefit costs, and to a lesser extent medical supply costs. The higher labor costs in 2006 reflect rising labor rates mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel and the effect of the increase in the number of newly opened centers, which are not yet at normal productivity levels. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers, or the direct costs associated with our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and include expenses for corporate and divisional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions, and regulatory compliance oversight. General and 41 Table of Contents administrative expenses as a percentage of current period operating revenues were 9.3%, 9.2%, and 8.9% in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expense for 2006 was primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives and government investigations, integration costs associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition and stock based compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R). The increase in general and administrative expense for 2005 was primarily due to infrastructure costs for expanding business operations, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives and government investigations, higher labor costs, and integration costs associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was approximately 4% of current period operating revenues for each of the past three years. The absolute dollar increase in depreciation and amortization in 2006 was due to additional centers from acquisitions and newly opened centers, amortization of intangible assets associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, offset by the amortization of the Product Supply Agreement as described below. Provision for uncollectible accounts. As a result of the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition and the higher historical provision rate for DVA Renal Healthcare, the post acquisition average provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2005. This rate was consistently maintained in 2006 and is expected to remain stable in 2007. The provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately 2.1% of current period operating revenues for the full year 2005, and 1.8% for 2004. Minority interests and equity income, net. Minority interests net of equity income increased to approximately $36 million in 2006, an increase of approximately $14 million over 2005. The increase was primarily due to an increase in new centers having minority partners as well as growth in the earnings of our joint ventures. Product Supply Agreement. On May 29, 2006, we notified Gambro Renal Products Inc. (Gambro Renal Products) that we were terminating the Alliance and Product Supply Agreement (the Product Supply Agreement) with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products. The Product Supply Agreement was entered into on October 5, 2005, in conjunction with our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare and committed us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products supplies and equipment at fixed prices. Our termination notice claimed a material breach by Gambro Renal Products for failure to perform its obligations under the Product Supply Agreement, primarily as a result of an import ban issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration affecting certain hemodialysis products. On August 25, 2006, we entered into an amended and restated Product Supply Agreement (the Amended Supply Agreement), with Gambro Renal Products and Gambro AB. The Amended Supply Agreement effectively revoked our notice of termination of the Product Supply Agreement. The Amended Supply Agreement, among other things, relieves us of certain obligations, including releasing us from the purchase requirements for certain affected products during the import ban, permits us to secure alternate sources of supplies for the products affected by the import ban, reduces our purchase obligations for certain hemodialysis product supplies and equipment and also allows for the termination of the purchase obligations for equipment affected by the import ban if the import ban is not lifted by June 30, 2007. As a result of the reductions in the amount of purchase obligations that are now required under the Amended Supply Agreement, we recorded a net valuation gain of approximately $38.0 million. This valuation gain represents the difference in the fair value between the Product Supply Agreement and the Amended Supply Agreement, as of the effective date of the amendment. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses, and our ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a 42 Table of Contents review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. Debt expense Debt expense for 2006, 2005, and 2004 consisted of interest expense of approximately $263 million, $134 million, and $50 million, respectively, amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $10 million in 2006, $5 million in 2005, and $2 million in 2004, and in 2006, included the write off of approximately $3.3 million of deferred financing costs associated with the principal prepayments on our term loans. The increase in interest expense in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to additional borrowings outstanding during 2006 under our credit facility, the increase in the average outstanding balances of our senior and senior subordinated notes, which were issued in March 2005, and increases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. The increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to borrowings under our credit facility in connection with the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare that was effective October 1, 2005, increases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates and issuance of our new senior and senior subordinated notes that have average fixed interest rates of approximately 7.0%, offset by changes in our LIBOR based receipts from swap settlements. Other income Other income, which was a net of approximately $13 million, $9 million, and $4 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, consisted principally of interest income. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2006 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 39.2%, compared with 37.4% and 38.6% in 2005 and 2004 respectively. The changes in the effective tax rates were primarily due to state income taxes and tax valuation allowance adjustments. We currently project that the effective income tax rate for 2007 will be in the range of 39.5% to 40%. Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2006 and 2005 represented approximately 70 and 71 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt provision. The relative decrease in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2006 was a result of improved cash collections. As of December 31, 2006 approximately $50 million in unreserved accounts receivable, representing approximately 5% of our total accounts receivable balance, were more than six months old. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than one half of 1% of our treatments are classified as patient pay. Virtually all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, other than the standard monthly processing, consisted of approximately $16 million and $24 million, respectively, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Our Medicare bad debt claims are typically not paid to us until the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims, and such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements except for potentially limiting the collectibility of Medicare bad debt claims. 43 Table of Contents DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition On October 5, 2005, we completed our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, Inc. from Gambro, Inc. under a Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 6, 2004, for $3.06 billion. DVA Renal Healthcare was one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers serving approximately 43,000 patients and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our consolidated financial statements from October 1, 2005. Divestitures per Federal Trade Commission Consent Order. As a condition of completing the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, we were required by the Federal Trade Commission to divest a total of 69 outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements. On October 6, 2005, DaVita and DVA Renal Healthcare completed the sale of 71 outpatient renal dialysis centers, and terminated the two management services agreements. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, we completed the sale of three additional centers to Renal Advantage, Inc. that were previously pending state regulatory approval in Illinois. We received total cash consideration of approximately $330 million for all of the centers divested and used approximately $13 million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture, to distribute a minority owners share of the sale proceeds, and to pay related transaction costs. We also paid related income taxes of approximately $85 million on these divestitures during the first quarter of 2006. As part of this transaction, Renal Advantage assumed specific liabilities related to the centers and all other liabilities were retained by us. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers are accounted for as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for 2005 and prior. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2006 our cash balance was $310 million and we had undrawn credit facilities totaling $253.6 million, ($250 million with our senior secured credit facility and $3.6 million associated with several joint ventures) of which approximately $50 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2006 amounted to $520 million, compared with $486 million for 2005. Cash flow from operations in 2006 included an income tax payment of approximately $85 million associated with divestitures of certain centers in conjunction with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition and also included cash interest payments of approximately $272 million reflecting our higher outstanding debt balances as a result of the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. Cash interest payments in 2005 were approximately $86 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2006 included $263 million for capital asset expenditures, including $143 million for new center developments and an additional $87 million for acquisitions. We also received in 2006 approximately $22 million from the sale of discontinued operations and asset sales. Non operating cash outflows in 2005 included $161 million for capital asset expenditures, including $93 million for new center developments, and an additional $3,202 million for acquisitions. We also received in 2005 approximately $299 million from the sale of discontinued operations. During 2006, we acquired a total of 26 dialysis centers, including two centers that we previously held a minority owned interest, opened 55 new dialysis centers and divested, sold or closed 14 centers. The acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare in the fourth quarter of 2005 resulted in the net addition of 492 dialysis centers after related divestitures. We acquired 54 other dialysis centers and opened 46 new dialysis centers during 2005. We currently expect to spend approximately $110 million to $120 million for general maintenance capital asset expenditures in 2007, and approximately $200 million to $220 million for new center development, relocations and center acquisitions. Our current projections include opening approximately the same number of 44 Table of Contents centers in 2007 that we opened in 2006. We expect to generate approximately $440 million to $510 million of operating cash flow in 2007. 2006 capital structure changes and other capital items. During 2006, we made principal payments totaling $62 million on the term loan A and $338 million on the term loan B which included mandatory principal payments of $35 million and $24.5 million respectively. All of the mandatory principal payments were paid in advance of the scheduled payment dates in 2006. Because of the principal prepayments, our next mandatory principal payments are $12.4 million in 2007, $52.5 million in 2008, $61.3 million in 2009, $87.5 million in 2010, and $65.6 million in 2011, for the term loan A and $379 million in 2011 and $1,727 million in 2012, for the term loan B. As a result of the principal prepayment made in 2006, we wrote off approximately $3.3 million of deferred financing costs, which is included in debt expense. On March 1, 2006, our interest rate margins on our term loan A and term loan B (collectively, the Credit Facility), were reduced by 0.25% as a result of achieving certain financial ratios as defined in the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2006, the term loan A bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% and the term loan B bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%. The margins are subject to adjustment depending upon changes in our financial ratios and can range from 1.50% to 2.25% for the revolving credit facility and term loan A, and 2.00% to 2.25% for the term loan B. Our credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and requires compliance with certain financial covenants, including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio that determine the interest rate margins described above. The credit agreement also contains limits on the annual amount of expenditures for acquisitions and capital improvements. Our senior and senior subordinated notes consist of $500 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. As of December 31, 2006, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $1,341 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.88%, on the hedged portion of our Credit Facility, including the term loan B margin of 2.00%. The swap agreements require quarterly interest payments, bear amortizing notional amounts, and expire in 2008 through 2010. During 2006, we accrued net cash benefits of $15.8 million from these swaps which is included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2006, the total fair value of these swaps was an asset of $29.5 million. We recorded $7.9 million, net of tax, as an increase to comprehensive income for the change in fair value of the effective portions of these swaps during 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 56% of our variable rate debt and approximately 72% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements at December 31, 2006, our overall effective weighted average interest rate on the Credit Facility was 6.61%, based upon the current margins in effect ranging from 1.75% to 2.00%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.76%. On February 23, 2007, we issued $400 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 in a private offering. These senior notes are part of the same series of debt securities as the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% senior notes that were issued in March 2005. The senior notes are guaranteed by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments beginning March 15, 2007. The senior notes may be redeemed in whole or part at any time on or after March 15, 2009, at certain specified prices. We used the proceeds to pay down our term loan B and also wrote off approximately $4 million of term loan B deferred financing costs. 45 Table of Contents On February 23, 2007, we amended and restated our existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities to, among other things, reduce the interest rate margin on our term loan B by 0.50%, and to amend certain covenants. The new term loan B will bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%. If we refinance the term loan B prior to February 23, 2008, we will be subject to a prepayment penalty of 1.0%, otherwise the payment terms remain the same. In addition, the amount by which we can elect to increase the revolving and term loan commitments was changed from $500 million to $750 million. On February 7, 2007, we entered into a National Provider Agreement with NxStage, Inc. The agreement provides us the ability to purchase NxStage home based hemodialysis products at a potential discount depending upon the achievement of certain volume targets. The agreement has an initial term of three years, terminating on December 31, 2009, and may be extended in six month increments up to two additional years if certain volume targets are met. As a part of the agreement, we purchased outright all of our NxStage System One equipment currently in use for $5.1 million, and will purchase a majority of our future home based hemodialysis equipment and supplies from NxStage. In connection with the provider agreement, we purchased 2 million shares of NxStage common stock in a private placement offering for $20 million, representing an ownership position of approximately 7%. In connection with the purchase of the shares, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement under which NxStage has agreed to register the shares. Stock based compensation Effective January 1, 2006, we implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R) Share Based Payment, which requires the measurement and recognition of cost for all stock based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, and discounted employee stock purchases. Under SFAS No. 123 (R) our stock based compensation awards are measured at estimated fair value on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense over their requisite service periods. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes our previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, under which we did not recognize compensation expense for most of our stock options. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 relating to the application of SFAS No. 123(R), and we have applied the provisions of SAB No. 107 in our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We implemented SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. In accordance with this method, our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to fiscal year 2006 have not been restated to reflect this change. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires that tax benefits realized from stock award exercise gains in excess of stock based compensation expense recognized for financial statement purposes be reported as cash flows from financing activities rather than as operating cash flows. We also elected to use the method available under FASB Staff Position FSP No. 123(R) 3 Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards, which provides an alternative method for calculating historical excess tax benefits from the method described in SFAS No. 123(R) for stock based compensation awards. Under SFAS No. 123(R), stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of the stock based award vesting during that period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for 2006 includes compensation cost for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of, December 31, 2005 and stock based awards granted in 2006. We previously recognized the effect of stock unit forfeitures as they occurred, and the effect of transitioning to recognition of expense based on expected forfeitures was insignificant. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in 2006, as well as for stock option grants during all prior periods. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized $26.4 million in stock based compensation expense for stock options, stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock units and discounted employee stock plan 46 Table of Contents purchases, which is primarily included in general and administrative expenses in continuing operations. The estimated tax benefit recorded for this stock based compensation was $9.7 million. As of December 31, 2006, there was $67.7 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.7 years. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we received $37.9 million in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $40.4 million in actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. 2005 capital structure changes. On October 5, 2005, we entered into a credit agreement allowing for borrowings of up to $3.05 billion. The facilities under the credit agreement consist of a $250 million six year revolving credit facility, a $350 million six year term loan A facility and a $2,450 million seven year term loan B facility (the Facilities). Existing borrowings under the Facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus margins initially ranging from 2.00% to 2.25%. The margins are subject to adjustment depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios and can range from 1.50% to 2.25% for the revolving credit facility and the term loan A, and 2.00% to 2.25% for the term loan B. The Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets. The credit agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and requires compliance with financial covenants, including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio that determine the interest rate margins described above. The aggregate amount of the Facilities may be increased by up to $500 million as long as no default exists or would result from such increase and we remain in compliance with the financial covenants after such increase. Such additional loans would be on substantially the same terms as the original borrowings under the Facilities. On October 5, 2005, we borrowed $2,850 million under the Facilities ($50 million on the revolving credit facility, $350 million on the term loan A and $2,450 million on term loan B), and used these borrowings, along with available cash of $252 million, to purchase DVA Renal Healthcare and pay related bank fees and expenses of approximately $47 million and to pay fees and expenses in connection with terminating our then existing credit facility. On October 7, 2005, we repaid the $50 million of the revolving credit facility with proceeds from the sale of the divested centers. On March 22, 2005, we issued $500 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015 and incurred related deferred financing costs of $28.6 million. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, and require semi annual interest payments. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. We used the net proceeds of $1,323 million along with available cash of $46 million to repay all outstanding amounts under the term loan portions of our then existing credit facilities, including accrued interest. In conjunction with the repayment and extinguishment of our prior credit facilities during 2005, we wrote off deferred financing costs of $8.2 million and reclassified into net income $8.1 million of swap valuation gains that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. These gains represented the accumulated fair value of several interest rate swap instruments that became ineffective as cash flow hedges as a result of the repayment of our prior credit facilities. In addition we recorded a net loss of $2.1 million related to changes in fair values of these swaps that were not effective as interest rate hedges until they were redesignated in the second quarter of 2005. Portions of our various interest rate swap agreements that were previously designated and expected to be effective as forward cash flow hedges became ineffective as a result of us not having any variable rate LIBOR based interest payments during a portion of 2005. This resulted in a net charge of $1.7 million to swap valuation gains, which includes the $1.5 million discussed below as well as a reclassification into income of $2.0 million of swap valuation losses that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income. The swap payment periods 47 Table of Contents that began after October 2005 were highly effective cash flow hedges with gains or losses from changes in their fair values reported in other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2005, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1,580 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 6.1%, which included the term loan B margin of 2.25%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2005, we incurred net cash obligations of approximately $1.8 million from these swaps, $0.3 million of which is included in debt expense and $1.5 million of which is included in swap valuation gains. As of December 31, 2005, the total fair value of these swaps was an asset of approximately $30.8 million. Also during 2005, we recorded $16.8 million, net of tax, of additional comprehensive income for the changes in fair value of the effective portions of these swaps. At December 31, 2005, our overall credit facility weighted average effective interest rate was 6.62%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.74%. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 55% of our variable rate debt and approximately 70% of our total debt economically fixed. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers, in the form of put provisions in joint venture agreements, which are exercisable at the third party owners future discretion. These put provisions, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the equity interest put to us. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several other third party owned centers, minority owned centers and physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under administrative services agreements. 48 Table of Contents The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2006 (in millions): Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 18 $ 117 $ 532 $ 3,077 $ 3,744 Interest payments on senior and senior subordinated notes 95 190 190 264 739 Capital lease obligations 3 1 1 2 7 Operating leases 148 258 198 294 898 $ 264 $ 566 $ 921 $ 3,637 $ 5,388 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 50 $ 50 Acquisition of dialysis centers 100 38 33 21 192 Working capital advances to third parties under administrative services agreements 11 11 $ 161 $ 38 $ 33 $ 21 $ 253 Not included above are interest payments related to our credit facilities. Our credit facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus margins ranging from 1.75% and 2.00% and are adjustable depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2006 our credit facilities had an overall effective weighted average interest rate of 6.61%. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific debt tranches within each Term Loan, which can range in maturity from one month to twelve months. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of mandatory principal payments and principal prepayments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no principal prepayments on our credit facilities during 2007 and no changes in the effective interest rate during 2007, approximately $158 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2007. In addition to the above commitments, we entered into an Alliance and Product Supply Agreement on October 5, 2005, with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. in conjunction with our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare that committed us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices over the next ten years. The Alliance and Product Supply Agreement was amended on August 25, 2006 to reduce our purchase obligations for certain hemodialysis product supplies and equipment and to allow for the termination of purchase obligations for certain equipment currently affected by an import ban issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration if the import ban is not lifted by June 30, 2007. The amended supply agreement continues to require us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis product supplies and equipment at fixed prices. Our total expenditures in 2006 on such products were approximately 4% of our total operating costs. The actual amount of purchases in future years under the amended supply agreement will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating and capital requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs and Gambro Renal Products ability to have the import ban lifted by June 30, 2007. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the valuation of this commitment. Contingencies The majority of our revenues are from government programs and may be subject to adjustment as a result of: (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; and (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental 49 Table of Contents requirements. In addition, our revenues from commercial payors may be subject to adjustment as a result of potential claims for refunds from commercial payors, as a result of government actions or as a result of other claims by commercial payors. United States Attorney inquiries On March 4, 2005, we received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office, or U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. The subpoena requires production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including documents related to, among other things, pharmaceutical and other services provided to patients, relationships with pharmaceutical companies, and financial relationships with physicians and joint ventures. The subpoena covers the period from December 1, 1996 through the present. In October 2005, we received a follow up request for additional documents related to specific medical director and joint venture arrangements. In February 2006, we received an additional subpoena for documents, including certain patient records relating to the administration and billing of Epogen (EPO). We are producing documents and providing information to the government. We are also cooperating, and intend to continue to cooperate, with the governments investigation, including by participating in discussions and meetings with the government. The subpoenas have been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as this to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoenas will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. On October 25, 2004, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. The subpoena covers the period from 1996 to present and requires the production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including DaVita Laboratory Services. The subpoena also includes specific requests for documents relating to testing for parathyroid hormone levels (PTH), and to products relating to vitamin D therapies. The subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and DVA Renal Healthcare, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena, including Fresenius Medical Group, Renal Care Group and DVA Renal Healthcare, which was acquired by us in October of 2005. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us or DVA Renal Healthcare at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoena may continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. In February 2001, the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of our historical practices, including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians. We cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the U.S. Attorneys Office. In May 2002, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office and the Philadelphia Office of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG). The subpoena required an update to the information we provided in our response to the February 2001 request, and also sought a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients, including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services, as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The subpoena covered the period from May 1996 to May 2002. We provided the documents requested and cooperated with the United States Attorneys Office and the OIG in its investigation. In January 2007, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia informed us that it has 50 Table of Contents decided to close its investigation of DaVita. No charges were made against us, no fines were assessed and no mandatory policy changes were required in connection with this investigation. In February 2007, we received a request for information from the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for records relating to EPO claims submitted to Medicare. The claims relate to services provided from 2002 to 2004 by a number of our centers. The request was sent from the OIGs office in Houston, Texas. We have been in contact with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Texas, which has stated that this is a civil inquiry related to EPO claims. We are cooperating with the inquiry and will be producing the requested records. There appears to be substantial overlap between this issue, and the ongoing review of EPO utilization and claims by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. EPO utilization was also one of the subjects of the multi year investigation by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which was recently closed as described herein. To the best of our knowledge, the government has not initiated any proceeding against us in connection with this request although we cannot predict whether we will receive further inquiries or whether or when a proceeding might be initiated. Other We have received several notices of claims from commercial payors and other third parties related to historical billing practices and claims against DVA Renal Healthcare related to historical DVA Renal Healthcare billing practices and other matters covered by their settlement agreement with the Department of Justice. At least one commercial payor has filed an arbitration demand against us, as described below, and additional commercial payors have threatened litigation. We intend to defend against these claims vigorously; however, we may not be successful and these claims may lead to litigation and any such litigation may be resolved unfavorably. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted at this time, an adverse result in excess of our established reserves, with respect to one or more of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have received several informal inquiries from representatives of the New York Attorney Generals Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU) regarding certain aspects of the EPO and other billing practices taking place at facilities managed by us in New York. We are cooperating with the MFCUs informal inquiries and have provided documents and information to the MFCU. To the best of our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us and the MFCU has not indicated an intention to do so, although we cannot predict whether we will receive further inquiries or whether or when proceedings might be initiated. In June 2004, DVA Renal Healthcare was served with a complaint filed in the Superior Court of California by one of its former employees who worked for its California acute services program. The complaint, which is styled as a class action, alleges, among other things, that DVA Renal Healthcare failed to provide overtime wages, defined rest periods and meal periods, or compensation in lieu of such provisions and failed to comply with certain other California labor code requirements. We are evaluating the claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the matter. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted, we do not expect that an unfavorable result, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. On August 8, 2005, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against Gambro AB, DVA Renal Healthcare and related entities. The plaintiff sought to bring its claims as a class action on behalf of itself and all entities that paid any of the defendants for health care goods and services from on or about January 1991 through at least December 2004. The complaint alleged, among other things, damages resulting from facts and circumstances underlying DVA Renal Healthcares December 2004 settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States Government. In March 2006, the case was dismissed and the plaintiff was compelled to seek arbitration to resolve the matter. In November 2006, the plaintiff filed a demand for class arbitration against us 51 Table of Contents and DVA Renal Healthcare. At this time, we cannot estimate the potential range of damages, if any. We are investigating these claims and continue to vigorously defend ourselves in the matter. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including from time to time, contractual disputes and professional and general liability claims. We believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, variable compensation accruals and purchase accounting valuation estimates, are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize for a reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the more than 1,200 commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g, 80% for Medicare patients) and b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g, Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 103,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. 52 Table of Contents Our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk is generally expected to be within 1% of total revenue, which can represent as much as 6.5% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments, including our investments in third party dialysis businesses and our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as applicable. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually, and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are also in the process of determining the impact of implementing Financial Account Standard Interpretation (FIN) No. 48 Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties effective January 1, 2007, that requires us to assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and to also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. The valuation of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired or assumed in connection with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition required numerous assessments and assumptions, including those concerning dialysis industry trends, our companys business strategies and 53 Table of Contents plans, the strategies of present or potential competitors, the quality of our continuing relationships with physicians and teammates and the likely effects of changes in those relationships, and other competitive and market conditions including those that involve dialysis product suppliers. These assumptions include expected outcomes under different acquisition agreement terms, and as a result, involve estimates of which the ultimate accuracy will never be known. We also make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets associated with other routine acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Long lived tangible and intangible assets are subject to our regular ongoing impairment assessments. Significant new accounting standards Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payment, which amended SFAS No. 123 and 95 and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. This standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, such as stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units and discounted employee stock purchases, based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize such cost over the requisite period during which an employee provides service. The grant date fair value is to be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for unique characteristics of the equity instruments. The standard also addresses the accounting for transactions that involve the creation of a liability in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of a companys equity instruments or that may be settled through the issuance of such equity instruments. The standard does not change the accounting for transactions involving equity instruments issued for services to non employees or the accounting for employee stock ownership plans. The standard also requires that the tax benefits realized from stock award exercises in excess of the stock based compensation expenses recognizable for financial statement purposes be reported on a prospective basis as a cash flow from financing activities rather than as an operating cash flow as previously required. This reduces net operating cash flows and increases net financing cash flows for periods after adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). During 2006, we recorded $26.4 million of stock based compensation expenses including stock based compensation associated with implementing SFAS No. 123(R). In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 48 Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement attribute on all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in order to be recognized in the financial statements. In making this assessment, a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position and that the tax position will be examined by appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. Once the recognition threshold is met, the tax position is then measured to determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. In addition, the recognition threshold of more likely than not must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of the tax benefit. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. We are currently assessing the expected impact of this Interpretation on our consolidated financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we adopted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying current year financial statement misstatements. The interpretations in SAB No. 108, which expresses the SECs staff views, were issued to address the diversity in the practice of quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential under current practice for a build 54 Table of Contents up of improper amounts on the balance sheet. The SEC staff indicated that companies should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in material misstatement. The adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2006. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average rates in effect at the end of 2006 including the economic effects of our swap agreements. These rates are based on the weighted average LIBOR rates plus margins in effect that are subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio plus the economic impact from the swap agreements. The margins currently in effect range from 1.75% to 2.00%. For our interest rate swap agreements, the table below presents the notional amounts by contract maturity date and the related interest rate terms of the agreements (to pay fixed rates, and to receive LIBOR). Expected maturity date Total Fair Value Average interest rate 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 5 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 $ 0 $ 1,352 $ 1,360 $ 1,372 7.02% Variable rate $ 16 $ 54 $ 62 $ 88 $ 444 $ 1,727 $ 2,391 $ 2,391 6.61% Notionalamount Contract maturity date Pay fixed Receivevariable Fairvalue 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 (dollars in millions) Swaps: Pay fixed swaps $ 1,341 $ 373 $ 378 $ 401 $ 189 $ 0 3.08% to 4.27 % LIBOR $ 29.5 As of December 31, 2006, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $1,341 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.88%, on the hedged portion of our Credit Facility, including the term loan B margin of 2.00%. The swap agreements require quarterly interest payments, bear amortizing notional amounts, and expire in 2008 through 2010. During 2006, we accrued net cash benefits of $15.8 million from these swaps which is included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2006, the total fair value of these swaps was an asset of $29.5 million. We recorded $7.9 million, net of tax, as an increase to comprehensive income for the change in fair value of the effective portions of these swaps during 2006. At December 31, 2006, our overall Credit Facility effective weighted average interest rate was 6.61%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.76%. As a result of all of our swap agreements, we had over 56% of our outstanding variable rate debt economically fixed and approximately 72% of our total debt economically fixed as of December 31, 2006. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $6.8 million, $3.2 million, and $5.9 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. 55 Table of Contents Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk.
