Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Forward looking statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements that do not concern historical facts are forward looking statements and include, among other things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, operating cash flow, estimated tax rates, capital expenditures, the development of new centers and center acquisitions, revenue estimating risk and our related level of indebtedness on our financial performance, including earnings per share. These statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements, including, but not limited to, risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors and possible reductions in government payment rates, changes in the structure of and payment rates under the Medicare ESRD program which may further reduce Medicare payment rates, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and compliance with the corporate integrity agreement applicable to the dialysis centers acquired from Gambro Healthcare and assumed in connection with such acquisition, the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies, and the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,359 outpatient dialysis centers and 700 hospitals, serving approximately 107,000 patients in 43 states. In 2007, our overall network of dialysis centers increased by 59 centers primarily as a result of opening new centers and acquisitions and the overall number of patients that we serve increased by approximately 4%. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three areas, our patients, our business partners, and our teammates, represents the major drivers of our potential long term success, although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes as measured by DQI have improved over each of the past three years, and we are pleased with our 2007 clinical outcomes. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. In addition, over the past couple of years we have achieved reductions in teammate turnover, which have been a major contributor to our clinical performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. Approximately 97% of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis and dialysis related services, such as laboratory services (collectively dialysis revenue). Eighty two percent of our dialysis revenue is derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in 1,336 centers that we consolidate that are either wholly owned 36 or majority owned. Other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services, which combined accounted for approximately 15% of our dialysis revenue, and the remaining 3% of our dialysis revenue was from laboratory services. Our other operations include various ancillary services and strategic initiatives consisting primarily of infusion therapy services, oral pharmacy services, vascular access services, disease management services and special needs plans, ESRD clinical research programs, and management and administration services to noncontrolling owned and third party owned centers and clinics, as further described in Item 1 in this Form 10 K. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our patients. These services generated approximately 3% of our total net revenues in 2007. We currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives as we work to develop strategically successful new business operations. However, significant changes in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may ultimately impact or continue to impact the economic viability of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes could result in a write off of some or all of our investments in these strategic initiatives. The principal drivers of our dialysis revenue are: (a) the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week, as well as the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services, (b) average dialysis revenue per treatment revenue and c) laboratory patient testing. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our ability to open and acquire new centers. Our year over year treatment volume growth was 5.7% in 2007. Average dialysis revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, dialysis services charge capture, and our billing and collecting operations performance. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are generally significantly higher than Medicare and Medicaid payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment. The following table summarizes our dialysis revenue and patient percentages by payor type for the year ended December 31, 2007: Revenues PatientPercentages Medicare and Medicare assigned HMO plans 58 % 80 % Medicaid 4 % 5 % Other government based programs 2 % 2 % Total government based programs 64 % 87 % Commercial 36 % 13 % Total dialysis revenue 100 % 100 % Government payment rates are principally determined by federal (Medicare) and state (Medicaid) policy. These payment rates have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of being reduced. Cumulative net increases in Medicare payment rates from 1990 through 2007 totaled approximately 10%. There were no Medicare payment rate increases for 2003 and 2004. CMS implemented increases of 1.6% on April 1, 2007, January 1, 2006 and January 1, 2005, however the 2005 increase was more than offset by other structural 37 changes to Medicare dialysis payment rates that also became effective January 1, 2005. Medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures. Commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are at contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Over the past several years we were successful in maintaining relatively stable average payment rates in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases. However, we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors and certain payors have become increasingly aggressive in their negotiations. In the fourth quarter of 2007, our overall commercial rate reductions were in excess of our overall commercial rate increases. We continue to expect downward pressure from payors on our contracted commercial payment rates as a result of general market conditions, recent and future consolidations among commercial payors, increased focus on dialysis services and other factors. In addition, payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations on non contracted or out of network providers, which could further decrease our commercial rate revenues. Slightly more than 30% of our dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007, has been associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for slightly more than 20% of our dialysis revenue. Therefore, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in private and governmental payment rates for EPO significantly influence our revenue levels. For example, in July 2007, CMS implemented a new reimbursement methodology for EPO which decreased our dialysis revenue per treatment and effective January 2008, changes to the EPO monitoring policy went into effect which further limit reimbursement and which have impacted the prescribing habits of our physicians. Such changes, as well as the reduction in some of our contracted commercial payment rates negatively impacted our average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2007. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services charge capture and billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average dialysis revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past several years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. In 2007, we began integrating our billing systems into one system. Systems upgrades will continue in 2008 and could impact our collection performance as well as our dialysis revenue per treatment. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis revenue per treatment including lab services for continuing operations was approximately $334, $330 and $323 for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2007 was primarily due to an increase in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue) and an increase in the Medicare composite rate, partially offset by a decrease in the government reimbursement for pharmaceuticals associated with the new CMS reimbursement rates for EPO, and a decrease in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. In 2006, average dialysis revenue per treatment was impacted by increases in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue) and changes in our commercial and government payor mix, as well as changes in the intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted and non contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average dialysis revenue per treatment in the future. The principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost changes, such as employee benefit costs and insurance costs. Our average clinical hours 38 per treatment have remained stable over the past couple of years primarily because of improved efficiencies driven by reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels previously achieved, and changes in federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. In 2007, our clinical hours per treatment remained stable compared to 2006, however, we did experience an increase in our labor rates per treatment of approximately 3%, as labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. For the past several years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors. In addition, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO provides for specific rebates off of list price and discount pricing based on process improvement and data submission and some combination of these factors, which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to qualify for these rebates and discounts. In 2007, we experienced an increase in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to general increases in rent and repairs and maintenance. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenues over the past three years. However, this reflects a substantial increase in the dollar amount of spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes as well as legal and other professional fees. We expect that the level of general and administrative expenses will be sustained or possibly increased in 2008, in order to continue to support our long term initiatives, including further investments in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Outlook for 2008. Our operating income guidance for 2008, excluding the impact of any potential Medicare legislation, is still projected to be in the range of $790 $850 million; however, we continue to believe that operating income is more likely to be in the lower end of the range for 2008. We are entering into a period of unusual earnings uncertainty. Therefore, the guidance range for 2008 does not capture as high a percentage of the potential outcomes as usual. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks and uncertainties include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors and possible reductions in government payment rates, changes in the structure of and payment rates under Medicare ESRD program which may further reduce Medicare payment rates, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and compliance with the corporate integrity agreement applicable to the dialysis centers acquired from Gambro Healthcare and assumed in connection with such acquisition, and the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the cautionary language contained in the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 36 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. 39 Results of operations Following is a summary of operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. Year ended December 31, Continuing Operations 2007 2006 2005 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, except per treatment data) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 5,264 100 % $ 4,881 100 % $ 2,970 100 % Prior years services laboratory 4 5,264 4,881 2,974 Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 3,590 68 % 3,390 70 % 2,036 69 % General and administrative 491 9 % 454 9 % 272 9 % Depreciation and amortization 193 4 % 173 4 % 117 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 137 3 % 126 2 % 62 2 % Minority interests and equity income, net 45 1 % 36 1 % 22 1 % Valuation gain on alliance and product supply agreement (55 ) (1 )% (38 ) (1 )% Total operating expenses and charges 4,402 84 % 4,141 85 % 2,509 85 % Operating income $ 862 16 % $ 739 15 % $ 465 16 % Dialysis treatments 15,318,995 14,495,796 9,044,966 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 48,942 46,372 28,898 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 324 $ 320 $ 313 Average dialysis revenue per treatment (including the lab) $ 334 $ 330 $ 323 The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results from October 1, 2005. Our operating income margins, increased to 16.4% in 2007 from 15.2% in 2006, primarily due to increases in revenue, an increase in the valuation gain on the alliance and product supply agreement, along with lower benefit costs, lower self insurance costs, as well as a reduction in integration expenditures. Net operating revenues Net operating revenues for current period services increased by approximately 8% in 2007, as compared to 2006 and increased by approximately 64% in 2006, as compared to 2005. The increase in net operating revenues in 2007 was primarily due to an increase of approximately 5% in the number of dialysis treatments, and an increase of approximately 3% in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, additional lab revenue and an increase in revenue from our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. The increase in the number of dialysis treatments in 2007 was primarily due to non acquired growth from existing and new centers and from acquisitions. Our average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $334 increased by approximately $4 in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase in net operating revenues in 2006 was primarily due to the number of dialysis treatments, which accounted for approximately 57% of the increase in revenues, primarily due to the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare effective on October 1, 2005 and the balance from acquisitions and growth in existing and new centers. The remaining 7% increase in total net operating revenues in 2006 was due to increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment and additional management fees and revenues from ancillary services and strategic initiatives. 40 Dialysis revenue, which includes dialysis services and related laboratory services, represented approximately 97%, 98% and 98% of net operating revenues in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including management fee income, accounted for the balance of our total revenues. Dialysis Services Dialysis revenue. The following table summarizes our dialysis revenue by source for the year ended December 31, 2007. RevenuePercentages Outpatient hemodialysis centers 82 % Peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis 9 % Hospital inpatient hemodialysis 6 % Laboratory services 3 % Total dialysis revenue 100 % Major components of dialysis revenue include both the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents slightly more than 30% of total dialysis revenue. Approximately 64% of our total dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 is from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage Plans, representing approximately 87% of our total patients. Our commercial payors consist principally of commercial insurance plans, including more than 1,100 with whom we have contracted rates. Approximately 36% of our dialysis revenue is associated with commercial payors. Approximately 1% of our dialysis services and related dialysis services payments are received directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 5% of total dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007. On average we are generally paid significantly more for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans than we are for patients covered by Medicare or Medicaid. Patients covered by employer group health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As of December 31, 2007, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $149 and $165 per treatment, or an overall average of $157 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our patient care costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates and others of which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. Our contracted commercial payment rates are under downward pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers and we expect this trend to continue into 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2007, our overall commercial rate reductions were in excess of our overall commercial rate increases,. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. Our year over year treatment volume growth was as follows: 2007 2006 Treatment growth related to: Existing and newly opened centers 4.6 % 4.8 % Other center acquisitions 1.1 % 4.0 % DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition effective 10/1/05 % 51.5 % Total treatment growth 5.7 % 60.3 % 41 The annual average dialysis revenue per treatment, including lab services, for continuing operations was approximately $334, $330 and $323 for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2007 was primarily due to an increase in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue) and an increase in the Medicare composite rate, partially offset by a decrease in the government reimbursement for pharmaceuticals associated with the new CMS reimbursement rates for EPO, and a decrease in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. In 2006, the average revenue per treatment was impacted by increases in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue), and changes in our commercial and government payor mix, as well as changes in the intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted and non contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future. Lab revenues. Lab revenues represented approximately 3% of our total net operating revenues for 2007 and 2006. A third party carrier review of Medicare claims associated with our Florida based laboratory was initiated in 1998. No Medicare payments were received for our lab services from the second quarter of 1998 until the third quarter of 2002 while we were appealing the Medicare payment withholds. Following a favorable administrative law judge ruling in 2002, we began receiving prior year Medicare payments in the third quarter of 2002, and received a total of approximately $91 million prior to 2005, and $4 million in 2005. There are no further significant unresolved Medicare lab billing issues. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including management fees, represented approximately 3% of our total net operating revenues in 2007 and approximately 2% in 2006. The increase in ancillary services and strategic initiative revenues were the result of the acquisition of HomeChoice Partners, an infusion therapy company, as well as growth in our pharmacy, vascular access and disease management businesses. Management fee income. Management fee income is included as part of our revenue from ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and represented less than 1% of net operating revenues for 2007 and 2006. We operated or provided administrative services to 23 and 38 third party or non controlled dialysis centers as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We also provided management and administrative services to 48 and 30 physician owned vascular access clinics at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our management fees are principally based on a percentage of the revenue or cash collections of the managed operations, or upon a percentage of operating income. In November 2007, one of our management and administrative services agreements was terminated, pursuant to which we provided management and administrative services to 20 dialysis centers. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and facility costs. As a percentage of current period operating revenues, patient care costs were approximately 68.2% for 2007, 69.5% for 2006 and 68.5% for 2005. On a per treatment basis, patient care costs were flat in 2007 as compared to 2006 and increased by approximately $9 in 2006. The 2007 patient care costs were impacted by an increase in labor costs, higher operating costs of our dialysis centers, as well as an increase in our stock based compensation expense, offset by a decrease in employee benefit costs and workers compensation, lower intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals and a reduction in our professional and general liability insurance costs. The increase in 2006 was principally due to higher labor and benefit costs, increases in expenses 42 related to our strategic initiatives and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The higher labor costs in 2007 and 2006 reflect rising labor rates mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel and the effect of the increase in the number of newly opened centers, which are not yet at normal productivity levels. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers, or the direct costs associated with our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and include expenses for corporate and divisional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions, and regulatory compliance oversight. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of current period operating revenues were 9.3%, 9.3%, and 9.2% in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expense for 2007 was primarily due to higher labor costs, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives and government investigations, stock based compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R), and the timing of certain expenditures, partially offset by lower integration costs related to the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. The absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expense for 2006 was primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives and government investigations, integration costs associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition and stock based compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R). Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was approximately 4% of current period operating revenues for each of the past three years. The absolute dollar increase in depreciation and amortization in 2007 was primarily due to additional centers from acquisitions and newly opened centers. The absolute dollar increase in 2006 was also due to additional centers from acquisitions and newly opened centers, as well as amortization of intangible assets associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, offset by the amortization of the Alliance and Product Supply Agreement as described below. Provision for uncollectible accounts. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was 2.6% for 2007 and 2006 and is expected to remain stable in 2008. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was approximately 2.1% of current period operating revenues for the full year 2005. Minority interests and equity income, net. Minority interests net of equity income increased by approximately $10 million in 2007, and increased by approximately $14 million in 2006. The increases for both years were primarily due to an increase in new dialysis centers having minority partners, growth in the earnings of our joint ventures and an increase in non wholly owned subsidiaries. Product Supply Agreement. We entered into an Alliance and Product Supply Agreement (Product Supply Agreement) with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. on October 5, 2005, in conjunction with our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. The agreement committed us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices through 2015. The agreement was amended on August 25, 2006 (the Amended Product Supply Agreement) to reduce our purchase obligations for certain hemodialysis product supplies and equipment and to allow for the termination of purchase obligations for certain equipment then affected by an import ban issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) if the import ban was not lifted by June 30, 2007. As a result of the reductions in the amount of purchase obligations required under the Amended Product Supply Agreement, we recorded a net valuation gain of $38 million during 2006. This valuation gain represents the difference in the amortized original fair value between the Product Supply Agreement and that of the Amended Product Supply Agreement, as of the effective date of the amendment. On July 2, 2007, we notified Gambro Renal Products, Inc. that we were electing to be permanently relieved of our obligation under the Amended Product Supply Agreement to purchase dialysis machines (the Affected Products) because the Affected Products remained subject to the FDA import ban after June 30, 2007. All other 43 purchase obligations under the Amended Product Supply Agreement, which continues to require us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis non equipment product supplies, such as dialyzers, at fixed prices, remain in place. As a result of the termination of our purchase obligations for the Affected Products, we recorded a net valuation gain of $55 million in 2007. This valuation gain represents the difference in the amortized original fair value of the Amended Product Supply Agreement and that of the Amended Product Supply Agreement as adjusted for the termination of the Affected Products as of June 30, 2007. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses, and our ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. Debt expense Debt expense for 2007, 2006, and 2005 consisted of interest expense of approximately $243 million, $263 million, and $134 million, respectively, amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $10 million in 2007, $10 million in 2006, and $5 million in 2005, and in 2007 and 2006, included the write off of approximately $4 million and $3 million of deferred financing costs associated with the principal prepayments on our term loans. The decrease in interest expense in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to lower average outstanding principal balances during 2007 under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as a result of principal prepayments, and decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Our overall weighted average interest rate in 2007 was 6.49% as compared to 6.64% in 2006. The increase in interest expense in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to additional borrowings outstanding during 2006 under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the increase in the average outstanding balances of our senior and senior subordinated notes, which were issued in March 2005, and increases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Other income Other income, net was approximately $22 million, $13 million, and $9 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, consisted principally of interest income. The increase in other income in 2007 and 2006 was primarily due to an increase in our cash and investments. The increase in 2007 was also due to gains on sale of investments. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2007 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 39.2%, compared with 39.2% and 37.4% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The changes in the effective tax rates in 2006 were primarily due to state income taxes and tax valuation allowance adjustments. We currently project that the effective income tax rate for 2008 will be in the range of 39.0% to 40.0%. Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2007 and 2006 represented approximately 66 and 70 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt provision. The relative decrease in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2007 was a result of improved cash collections. 44 As of December 31, 2007 approximately $23 million in unreserved accounts receivable, representing approximately 2% of our total accounts receivable balance, were more than six months old. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Approximately 1% of our treatments are classified as patient pay. Virtually all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, other than the standard monthly processing, consisted of approximately $31 million and $16 million, respectively, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Currently, our Medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. However, the payment received from Medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. Such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements except for potentially limiting the collectibility of Medicare bad debt claims. DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition On October 5, 2005, we completed our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, Inc. from Gambro, Inc. under a stock purchase agreement dated December 6, 2004, for $3.06 billion. DVA Renal Healthcare was one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers serving approximately 43,000 patients and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our consolidated financial statements from October 1, 2005. Divestitures per Federal Trade Commission Consent Order. As a condition of completing the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, we were required by the Federal Trade Commission to divest a total of 69 outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements. On October 6, 2005, DaVita and DVA Renal Healthcare completed the sale of 71 outpatient renal dialysis centers, and terminated the two management services agreements. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, we completed the sale of three additional centers to Renal Advantage, Inc. that were previously pending state regulatory approval in Illinois. We received total cash consideration of approximately $330 million for all of the centers divested and used approximately $13 million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture, to distribute a minority owners share of the sale proceeds, and to pay related transaction costs. We also paid related income taxes of approximately $85 million on these divestitures during the first quarter of 2006. As part of this transaction, Renal Advantage assumed specific liabilities related to the centers and all other liabilities were retained by us. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers are accounted for as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for 2005. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2007 our cash balance was $447 million and we had undrawn Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $250 million, of which approximately $41 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We also had other undrawn revolving lines of credit totaling $7.2 million associated with several of our joint ventures. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2007 amounted to $533 million, compared with $520 million for 2006. Cash flow from operations in 2007 included cash interest payments of approximately $245 million and cash tax payments of $206 million. Cash flow from operations in 2006 included an income tax payment of approximately $85 million associated with the divestiture of certain centers in conjunction with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, and cash interest payments of $272 million and other cash tax payments of $125 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2007 included $272 million for capital asset expenditures, including $162 million for new center developments and relocations, and an additional $127 million for acquisitions. 45 During 2007 we also received $37 million from the maturity and sale of investments as well as an additional $88 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also repurchased 0.1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $6.4 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2006 included $263 million for capital asset expenditures, including $143 million for new center developments and relocations, and an additional $87 million for acquisitions. In 2006, we received approximately $22 million for the sale of discontinued operations and asset sales. During 2007, we acquired a total of 16 dialysis centers, opened 64 new dialysis centers, sold or closed 6 centers, and discontinued providing management and administrative services to 21 centers. We also acquired a 50% noncontrolling ownership interest in a joint venture that operates six dialysis centers. During 2006 we acquired a total of 26 dialysis centers, including two centers that we previously held a minority owned interest, opened 55 new dialysis centers and divested, sold or closed 14 centers. We currently expect to spend approximately $120 million for general maintenance capital asset expenditures in 2008, and approximately $200 million for new center development, relocations and center acquisitions. Our current projections include opening approximately the same number of centers in 2008 that we opened in 2007. We expect to generate approximately $480 million to $530 million of operating cash flow in 2008. 2007 capital structure changes and other capital items. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain customary affirmative and negative covenants and require compliance with financial covenants, including an interest rate coverage ratio and a leverage ratio that determines the interest rate margins on term loan A and the revolving line of credit. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities in general also contain limits on the general amount of capital expenditures for internal growth, acquisitions and capital improvements, see discussion below, as well as limits on the amount of tangible net assets for non guarantor subsidiaries. During 2007, we made principal payments totaling $50 million on term loan A and $400 million on term loan B. The term loan B payment was made from the proceeds of issuing new senior notes as discussed below. These principal payments were prepayments. As a result of the principal prepayment made in 2007 we wrote off a total of $4.4 million of deferred financing costs, which is included in debt expense. Term Loan A On February 27, 2007, our interest rate margin on term loan A was reduced by 0.25% as a result of achieving certain financial ratios as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Term loan A currently bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall effective rate of 6.35% at December 31, 2007. The interest rate margin is subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term loan A matures in October 2011 and requires annual principal payments of $14.9 million in 2008, $61.3 million in 2009, $87.5 million in 2010 and $65.6 million in 2011, respectively. Term Loan B On February 23, 2007, we amended and restated our existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities to, among other things, reduce the interest rate margin on term loan B by 0.50%, and to amend certain financial covenants. The amended term loan B bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall effective rate of 5.80%, including the impact of our swap agreements, except for the forward interest rate swap agreements, as of December 31, 2007. Other terms that were changed included the amount by which we can elect to increase the revolving and term loan commitments from $500 million to $750 million and certain limitations on purchases, redemptions or acquisitions of capital stock, the payment of dividends and distributions in cash. Further, 46 limitations on capital expenditures for internal growth will not apply during the periods in which our leverage ratio is less than 3.5:1. Our leverage ratio as of December 31, 2007 was less than 3.5:1. We incurred financing costs of $1.8 million which were deferred and also expensed $0.2 million of other costs in connection with this transaction. Term loan B matures in October 2012 and requires principal payments of $1.7 billion in year 2012. Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes On February 23, 2007, we issued $400 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 in a private offering, realizing $405 million in proceeds, which included a $5 million premium, and incurred $2.7 million in related deferred financing costs. These senior notes are part of the same series of debt securities as the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% senior notes that were issued in March 2005. The effective interest rate for the $400 million of 6 5/8% senior notes is 6.45%. The senior notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments which began March 15, 2007. The senior notes may be redeemed by us in whole or part at any time on or after March 15, 2009, at certain specified prices. We used $400 million of these proceeds to pay down our term loan B as discussed above. Our senior and senior subordinated notes, as of December 31, 2007, consisted of $900 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments in March and September. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time as described above and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2007, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $968 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.37% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. In addition, we maintain two forward interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $200 million. These forward interest rate swaps will have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rates to fixed rates of 4.05% and 4.70% on our term loan B outstanding debt. These forward interest rate swaps agreements take effect September 30, 2008, require quarterly interest payments beginning in December 2008, and expire in 2010. During 2007, 2006, and 2005 we accrued net cash benefits (obligations) of approximately $14.5 million, $15.8 million, and $(0.3) million, respectively from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. During 2005, we also incurred additional net cash obligations of $1.5 million from these swaps, which is included in swap valuation gains. We estimate that approximately $0.5 million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2007 will be reclassified into income in 2008. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the total fair value of these swaps was a net liability of $0.5 million, and an asset of $29.5 million, respectively. The 2007 amount was primarily included in other long term liabilities and the 2006 amount was primarily included in other long term assets. Also during 2007 and 2006, we recorded $16.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, net of tax, as reductions to other comprehensive income for valuation losses, net of amounts reclassified into income. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 50% of our variable rate debt and approximately 74% of our total debt economically fixed. As a result of the swap agreements, our overall effective weighted average interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 5.90%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, as of December 31, 2007. 47 At December 31, 2007, our overall average effective interest rate was 6.37%. NxStage Agreement On February 7, 2007, we entered into a National Provider Agreement with NxStage, Inc. The agreement provides us the ability to purchase NxStage home based hemodialysis products at a potential discount depending upon the achievement of certain volume targets. The agreement has an initial term of three years, terminating on December 31, 2009, and may be extended in six month increments up to two additional years if certain volume targets are met. As a part of the agreement, we purchased outright all of our NxStage System One equipment then in use for $5.1 million, and will purchase a majority of our future home based hemodialysis equipment and supplies from NxStage. In connection with the provider agreement, we purchased two million shares of NxStage common stock in a private placement offering for $20 million, representing an ownership position of approximately 7%. We subsequently sold our NxStage Inc. shares, in the second and third quarters of 2007 for approximately $25.9 million and recognized a pre tax gain of $5.9 million or $3.6 million after tax. This pre tax gain is included in other income. Stock based compensation and other equity matters Effective January 1, 2006, we implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R) Share Based Payment, which requires the measurement and recognition of cost for all stock based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, and discounted employee stock purchases. Under SFAS No. 123(R) our stock based compensation awards are measured at estimated fair value on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense over their requisite service periods. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes our previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, under which we did not recognize compensation expense for most of our stock options. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 relating to the application of SFAS No. 123(R), and we have applied the provisions of SAB No. 107 in our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We implemented SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. In accordance with this method, our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to fiscal year 2006 have not been restated to reflect this change. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires that tax benefits realized from stock award exercise gains in excess of stock based compensation expense recognized for financial statement purposes be reported on a prospective basis as cash flows from financing activities rather than as operating cash flows. We also elected to use the method available under Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Staff Position FSP No. 123(R) 3 Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards, which provides an alternative method for calculating historical excess tax benefits from the method described in SFAS No. 123(R) for stock based compensation awards. Under SFAS No. 123(R), stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of the stock based award vesting during that period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for 2007 and 2006 includes compensation cost for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of, December 31, 2005 and subsequent stock based awards granted through December 31, 2006 and 2007. Prior to 2006, we recognized the effect of stock unit forfeitures as they occurred, and the effect of transitioning to recognition of expense based on expected forfeitures was insignificant. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in 2007, 2006 and all prior periods. 48 For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we recognized $34.1 million and $26.4 million, respectively, in stock based compensation expense for stock options, stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock units and discounted employee stock plan purchases, which is primarily included in general and administrative expenses in continuing operations. The estimated tax benefits recorded for this stock based compensation in 2007 and 2006 were $12.8 million and $9.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, there was $78.6 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.6 years. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we received $54.7 million and $37.9 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $32.8 million and $40.4 million, respectively, in total actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. On May 29, 2007, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to increase the number of shares of authorized common stock from 195,000,000 to 450,000,000 shares. Our stockholders also approved an amendment and restatement of our Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under that plan by 800,001 shares, and approved an amendment and restatement of our 2002 Equity Compensation Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under that plan by 6,000,000 shares and, among other things, to remove certain available share recycling features, to change the limit on the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be subject to awards granted to any single recipient in any consecutive twenty four month period so that it applies only to awards of stock options and stock appreciation rights, and to provide additional exceptions from the three year minimum vesting period generally applicable to grants of restricted stock units and other full share awards. 2006 capital structure changes. During 2006, we made principal payments totaling $62 million on our term loan A and $338 million on term loan B which included mandatory principal payments of $35 million and $24.5 million respectively. All of the mandatory principal payments were paid in advance of the scheduled payment dates in 2006. As a result of the principal prepayment made in 2006, we wrote off approximately $3.3 million of deferred financing costs, which is included in debt expense. On March 1, 2006, our interest rate margins on our term loan A and term loan B were reduced by 0.25% as a result of achieving certain financial ratios as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. At December 31, 2006, the term loan A interest rate was based on LIBOR plus 1.75% and the term loan B interest rate was based on LIBOR plus 2.00%. The margins were subject to adjustment depending upon changes in our financial ratios and could have ranged from 1.50% to 2.25% for the revolving line of credit and term loan A, and 2.00% to 2.25% for term loan B. As of December 31, 2006, our senior and senior subordinated notes consisted of $500 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. As of December 31, 2006, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1,341 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.88%, on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 2.00%. The swap agreements require quarterly interest payments, bear amortizing notional amounts, and expire in 2008 through 2010. As of December 31, 2006, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 56% of our variable rate debt and approximately 72% of our total debt. 49 As a result of the swap agreements at December 31, 2006, our overall effective weighted average interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 6.61%, based upon the current margins in effect ranging from 1.75% to 2.00%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.76%. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers and for some of our non wholly owned subsidiaries, in the form of put provisions, which are exercisable at the third party owners future discretion. These put provisions, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the equity interest put to us, which approximates fair value. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several other third party owned centers, noncontrolling owned centers and physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2007 (in millions): Less Than1 year 1 3years 3 5years After5 years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 22 $ 152 $ 1,772 $ 1,750 $ 3,696 Interest payments on senior and senior subordinated notes 121 243 243 183 790 Capital lease obligations 1 1 1 4 7 Operating leases 170 288 223 336 1,017 FIN No. 48 tax liabilities 4 9 4 17 $ 318 $ 693 $ 2,243 $ 2,273 $ 5,527 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 41 $ 41 Acquisition of dialysis centers 131 99 54 46 330 Working capital advances to third parties under administrative services agreements 18 18 $ 190 $ 99 $ 54 $ 46 $ 389 Not included above are interest payments related to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2007 bear interest at LIBOR plus current margins of 1.50%. The term loan A and the revolving line of credit are adjustable depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2007, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities had an overall effective weighted average interest rate of 5.90%, including the effects of our swap agreements. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific debt tranches within each term loan, which can range in maturity from one month to twelve months. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of mandatory principal payments and principal prepayments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no principal prepayments on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities during 2008 and no changes in the effective interest rate, approximately $116 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2008. Our Amended Alliance and Product Supply Agreement with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. (the Amended Product Supply Agreement) requires us to purchase a significant majority of certain hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices through 2015. On July 2, 2007, we notified Gambro Renal Products, Inc. that we were electing to be permanently relieved of our purchase obligation under the Amended 50 Product Supply Agreement to purchase dialysis machines (the Affected Products) because the Affected Products remained subject to an FDA import ban after June 30, 2007. Our total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 on products under the Amended Product Supply Agreement were approximately 2% and 4%, respectively, of our total operating costs. The actual amount of purchases in future years under the Amended Product Supply Agreement will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating and capital requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, and Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. Settlements of approximately $11.0 million of existing FASB Interpretation 48 (FIN 48) liabilities are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made. Contingencies The majority of our revenues are from government programs and may be subject to adjustment as a result of: (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; and (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements. In addition, our revenues from commercial payors may be subject to adjustment as a result of potential claims for refunds, as a result of government actions or as a result of other claims by commercial payors. United States Attorney inquiries In February 2007, we received a request for information from the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, for records relating to Epogen&reg;, or EPO, claims submitted to Medicare. In August 2007, we received a subpoena from the OIG seeking similar documents. The requested documents relate to services provided from 2001 to 2004 by a number of our centers. The request and subpoena were sent from the OIGs offices in Houston and Dallas, Texas. We are cooperating with the inquiry and are producing the requested records. We have been in contact with the United States Attorneys Office, or U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Eastern District of Texas, which has stated that this is a civil inquiry related to EPO claims. There appears to be substantial overlap between this issue and the ongoing review of EPO utilization and claims by the U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis described below. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoena will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. On March 4, 2005, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. The subpoena requires production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including documents related to, among other things, pharmaceutical and other services provided to patients, relationships with pharmaceutical companies, and financial relationships with physicians and joint ventures. The subpoena covers the period from December 1, 1996 through the present. In October 2005, we received a follow up request for additional documents related to specific medical director and joint venture arrangements. In February 2006, we received an additional subpoena for documents, including certain patient records relating to the administration and billing of EPO. In May 2007, we received a request for documents related to durable medical equipment (DME) and supply companies owned and operated by us. We are producing documents and providing information to the government. We are also cooperating, and intend to continue to cooperate, with the governments investigation, including by participating in discussions and meetings with the government. The subpoenas have been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in 51 substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as this to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoenas will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. On October 25, 2004, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. The subpoena covers the period from 1996 to present and requires the production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including DaVita Laboratory Services. Gambro Healthcare received a similar subpoena in November 2004. The subpoena also includes specific requests for documents relating to testing for PTH levels and to products relating to vitamin D therapies. The subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena, including Fresenius Medical Group. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoena may continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. Other We have received several notices of claims from commercial payors and other third parties related to historical billing practices and claims against DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare) related to historical Gambro Healthcare billing practices and other matters covered by their settlement agreement with the Department of Justice. At least one commercial payor has filed an arbitration demand against us, as described below, and additional commercial payors have threatened litigation. We intend to defend against these claims vigorously; however, we may not be successful and these claims may lead to litigation and any such litigation may be resolved unfavorably. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted at this time, an adverse result in excess of our established reserves, with respect to one or more of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In December 2007, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the State of New York to resolve certain billing issues that had been the subject of inquiry by the New York Attorney Generals Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, or MFCU. We had received several informal inquiries from representatives of the MFCU regarding billing practices for facilities managed by us in New York. The Settlement Agreement covers numerous dialysis facilities in New York for which we, through our subsidiaries, provide administrative services. We paid approximately $1.5 million in settlement, which included the amount of the overpayments by the New York Medicaid program plus interest; no fines or penalties were assessed. In October 2007, we were contacted by the Attorney Generals Office for the State of Nevada. The Attorney Generals Office informed us that it was conducting a criminal investigation of our operations in Nevada and that the investigation related to the billing of pharmaceuticals, including EPO. On February 8, 2008, the Attorney Generals Office informed us that the criminal investigation has been discontinued. The Attorney Generals Office further advised us that Nevada Medicaid intends to conduct audits of ESRD providers in Nevada, including us, and that such audits will relate to the issues that were the subjects of the criminal investigation. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. On August 28, 2007, Sheet Metal Workers National Health Fund and Glenn Randle filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against us. The complaint also names as 52 defendants Amgen, Inc. and Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. The complaint is styled as a class action and alleges four claims against us, including violations of the federal RICO statute, Californias unfair competition law, Californias false advertising law and for unjust enrichment. The complaints principal allegations against us are that the defendants engaged in a scheme to unlawfully promote the administration of EPO to hemodialysis patients intravenously, as opposed to subcutaneously, and to over utilize EPO. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or the potential range of damages, if any. On August 8, 2005, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against Gambro AB, DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly Gambro Healthcare) and related entities. The plaintiff sought to bring its claims as a class action on behalf of itself and all entities that paid any of the defendants for health care goods and services from on or about January 1991 through at least December 2004. The complaint alleged, among other things, damages resulting from facts and circumstances underlying Gambro Healthcares December 2004 settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States Government. In March 2006, the case was dismissed and the plaintiff was compelled to seek arbitration to resolve the matter. In November 2006, the plaintiff filed a demand for class arbitration against us and DVA Renal Healthcare. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or the potential range of damages, if any. In June 2004, Gambro Healthcare was served with a complaint filed in the Superior Court of California by one of its former employees who worked for its California acute services program. The complaint, which is styled as a class action, alleges, among other things, that DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly Gambro Healthcare) failed to provide overtime wages, defined rest periods and meal periods, or compensation in lieu of such provisions and failed to comply with certain other California labor code requirements. We intend to vigorously defend against this claim. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted, we do not expect that an unfavorable result, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits, including from time to time, contractual disputes and professional and general liability claims, as well as audits and investigations by various government entities, in the ordinary course of business. We believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly variable compensation accruals, purchase accounting valuation estimates and stock based compensation are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize in a reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant 53 uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the more than 1,100 commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 107,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk to be within 1% of total revenue, which can represent as much as 6.0% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments in third party dialysis businesses, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually, and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. 54 Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year, and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties, which went effective January 1, 2007, we assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain and future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. We make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Long lived tangible and intangible assets are subject to our regular ongoing impairment assessments. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based awards to employees and directors in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payments. Under SFAS No. 123(R), stock based compensation is recognized during a period based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of the stock based award vesting during that period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 includes compensation costs for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of December 31, 2005, and stock based awards granted in those years. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk free interest rates. Significant new accounting standards On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements except for the nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are subject to a one year deferral allowed by FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS157 2 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157. This standard establishes a framework for measuring fair value and also requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard applies to assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. On February 12, 2008, FSP FAS157 2 was issued delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 157 until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The implementation of this standard relating to the assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159 Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of SFAS No. 115. This standard allows companies the alternative to measure 55 certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis that are currently not required to be measured at fair value. The standard is also designed to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R) Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations. This standard requires all business combinations to be accounted for under the acquisition method (previously referred to as the purchase method). Under the acquisition method, the acquirer recognizes the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date. Noncontractual contingencies are recognized at the acquisition date at their fair values only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6 Elements of Financial Statements. Transaction costs are excluded from the acquisition accounting and will be expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration included by the acquirer as part of the purchase price must also be measured at fair value at the acquisition date and will be classified as either equity or a liability. This standard also requires a company that obtains control but acquires less than 100% of an acquiree to record 100% of the fair value of the acquiree assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests at the acquisition date. This standard is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently in the process of assessing the expected impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160 Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, which amends Accounting Research Bulletin, No. 51 Consolidated Financial Statements. This standard requires noncontrolling interests to be treated as a separate component of equity, but apart from the parents equity and not as a liability, or an item outside of equity. This will eliminate diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and its noncontrolling interests. This standard also specifies that consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income, and that changes in the parents ownership interest while it retains a controlling financial interest should be accounted for as equity transactions. This standard also expands disclosures in the financial statements to include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the equity attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling owners and a schedule showing the effects of changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary on the equity attributable to the parent. This standard is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently in the process of assessing the expected impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with SFAS Statement No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement attribute on all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in order to be recognized in the financial statements. In making this assessment, a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position and must assume that the tax position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. Once the recognition threshold is met, the tax position is then measured to determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. In addition, the recognition threshold of more likely than not must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of the tax benefit. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. See note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of adopting this interpretation. 56 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2007. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average LIBOR rates plus margins in effect at the end of 2007 including the economic effects of our swap agreements. Term loan A and revolving line of credit interest rate margins are subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio. The margins currently in effect at December 31, 2007 were 1.50%. For our interest rate swap agreements, the table below presents the notional amounts by contract maturity date and the related interest rate terms of the agreements (to pay fixed rates, and to receive LIBOR). Expected maturity date Total FairValue Averageinterestrate 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 4 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 $ 0 $ 1,753 $ 1,760 $ 1,755 6.89 % Variable rate $ 20 $ 63 $ 88 $ 66 $ 1,706 $ $ 1,943 $ 1,943 5.91 % Notionalamount Contract maturity date Pay fixed Receivevariable Fairvalue 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 (dollars in millions) Swaps: Pay fixed swaps $ 968 $ 378 $ 401 $ 189 $ $ 3.08% to 4.27% LIBOR $ 2.2 Forward pay fixed swaps $ 200 $ $ $ 200 $ $ 4.05% to 4.70% LIBOR $ (2.7 ) As of December 31, 2007, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $968 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.37% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. In addition, we maintain two forward interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $200 million. These forward interest rate swaps will have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rates to fixed rates of 4.05% and 4.70% on our term loan B outstanding debt. These forward interest rate swaps agreements take effect September 30, 2008, require quarterly interest payments beginning in December 2008, and expire in 2010. During 2007, we accrued net cash benefits of $14.5 million from these swaps which is included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2007, the total fair value of these swaps was a net liability of $0.5 million. During 2007, we recorded $16.0 million, net of tax, as a reduction to other comprehensive income for valuation losses, net of amounts reclassified into income. As of December 31, 2007, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 50% of our variable rate debt and approximately 74% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements, the overall effective weighted average interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 5.90%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50% as of December 31, 2007. Our overall average effective interest rate during 2007 was 6.49% and as of December 31, 2007 was 6.37%. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis 57 points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $5.5 million, $6.8 million, and $3.2 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this report. The following table presents selected consolidated financial and operating data for the periods indicated. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results from October 1, 2005, and the operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income for 2005 and prior.

(2) Debt expense in 2007 and 2006 includes the write off of approximately $4.4 million and $3.3 million of deferred financing costs associated with our principal prepayments on the Term loans. (3) The swap valuation net gains of $4,548 in 2005 represented the accumulated fair value on several swap instruments that were ineffective as cash flow hedges, as a result of the repayment of our Senior Secured 34 Credit Facilities, as well as changes in the fair values of these swaps until they were redesignated as hedges, and represent changes in the fair value of the swaps during periods in which there was no matching variable rate LIBOR based interest payments. (4) Refinancing charges of $8,170 in 2005 represented the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the extinguishment of our prior Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Refinancing charges of $26,501 in 2003 represented the consideration paid to redeem the $125,000 5 5/8% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 and the $345,000 7% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 in excess of book value, the write off of related deferred financing costs and other financing fees associated with the amendment of the prior Senior Secured Credit Facilities. (5) During 2005, we divested a total of 71 outpatient dialysis centers in conjunction with a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission on October 4, 2005 in order for us to complete the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. In addition, we completed the sale of three additional centers that were previously pending state regulatory approval in January 2006. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested and held for sale centers were reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for 2005 and prior. (6) All share and per share data for all periods presented prior to 2005 have been adjusted to retroactively reflect the effects of a 3 for 2 stock split that occurred in the second quarter of 2004. (7) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed by dividing earnings by fixed charges. Earnings for this purpose is defined as pretax income from continuing operations adjusted by adding back fixed charges expensed during the period. Fixed charges include debt expense (interest expense and the write off and amortization of deferred financing costs), the estimated interest component of rental expense on operating leases, and capitalized interest. (8) Share repurchases consisted of 111,300 shares of common stock for $6,350 in 2007, 3,350,100 shares of common stock for $96,540 in 2004 and 5,162,850 shares of common stock for $107,162 in 2003. Debt of $124,700 and $526 was converted into 7,302,528 and 24,045 shares of common stock in 2003. Shares issued in connection with stock awards amounted to 2,480,899 in 2007, 2,620,125 in 2006, 3,303,451 in 2005, 5,106,783 in 2004, and 3,539,919 in 2003. 35 Item 7.

We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,359 outpatient dialysis centers and 700 hospitals, serving approximately 107,000 patients in 43 states. In 2007, our overall network of dialysis centers increased by 59 centers primarily as a result of opening new centers and acquisitions and the overall number of patients that we serve increased by approximately 4%. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three areas, our patients, our business partners, and our teammates, represents the major drivers of our potential long term success, although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes as measured by DQI have improved over each of the past three years, and we are pleased with our 2007 clinical outcomes. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. In addition, over the past couple of years we have achieved reductions in teammate turnover, which have been a major contributor to our clinical performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. Approximately 97% of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis and dialysis related services, such as laboratory services (collectively dialysis revenue). Eighty two percent of our dialysis revenue is derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in 1,336 centers that we consolidate that are either wholly owned 36 or majority owned. Other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services, which combined accounted for approximately 15% of our dialysis revenue, and the remaining 3% of our dialysis revenue was from laboratory services. Our other operations include various ancillary services and strategic initiatives consisting primarily of infusion therapy services, oral pharmacy services, vascular access services, disease management services and special needs plans, ESRD clinical research programs, and management and administration services to noncontrolling owned and third party owned centers and clinics, as further described in Item 1 in this Form 10 K. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our patients. These services generated approximately 3% of our total net revenues in 2007. We currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives as we work to develop strategically successful new business operations. However, significant changes in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may ultimately impact or continue to impact the economic viability of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes could result in a write off of some or all of our investments in these strategic initiatives. The principal drivers of our dialysis revenue are: (a) the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week, as well as the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services, (b) average dialysis revenue per treatment revenue and c) laboratory patient testing. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our ability to open and acquire new centers. Our year over year treatment volume growth was 5.7% in 2007. Average dialysis revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, dialysis services charge capture, and our billing and collecting operations performance. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are generally significantly higher than Medicare and Medicaid payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment. The following table summarizes our dialysis revenue and patient percentages by payor type for the year ended December 31, 2007: Revenues PatientPercentages Medicare and Medicare assigned HMO plans 58 % 80 % Medicaid 4 % 5 % Other government based programs 2 % 2 % Total government based programs 64 % 87 % Commercial 36 % 13 % Total dialysis revenue 100 % 100 % Government payment rates are principally determined by federal (Medicare) and state (Medicaid) policy. These payment rates have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of being reduced. Cumulative net increases in Medicare payment rates from 1990 through 2007 totaled approximately 10%. There were no Medicare payment rate increases for 2003 and 2004. CMS implemented increases of 1.6% on April 1, 2007, January 1, 2006 and January 1, 2005, however the 2005 increase was more than offset by other structural 37 changes to Medicare dialysis payment rates that also became effective January 1, 2005. Medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures. Commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are at contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Over the past several years we were successful in maintaining relatively stable average payment rates in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases. However, we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors and certain payors have become increasingly aggressive in their negotiations. In the fourth quarter of 2007, our overall commercial rate reductions were in excess of our overall commercial rate increases. We continue to expect downward pressure from payors on our contracted commercial payment rates as a result of general market conditions, recent and future consolidations among commercial payors, increased focus on dialysis services and other factors. In addition, payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations on non contracted or out of network providers, which could further decrease our commercial rate revenues. Slightly more than 30% of our dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007, has been associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for slightly more than 20% of our dialysis revenue. Therefore, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in private and governmental payment rates for EPO significantly influence our revenue levels. For example, in July 2007, CMS implemented a new reimbursement methodology for EPO which decreased our dialysis revenue per treatment and effective January 2008, changes to the EPO monitoring policy went into effect which further limit reimbursement and which have impacted the prescribing habits of our physicians. Such changes, as well as the reduction in some of our contracted commercial payment rates negatively impacted our average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2007. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services charge capture and billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average dialysis revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past several years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. In 2007, we began integrating our billing systems into one system. Systems upgrades will continue in 2008 and could impact our collection performance as well as our dialysis revenue per treatment. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis revenue per treatment including lab services for continuing operations was approximately $334, $330 and $323 for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2007 was primarily due to an increase in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue) and an increase in the Medicare composite rate, partially offset by a decrease in the government reimbursement for pharmaceuticals associated with the new CMS reimbursement rates for EPO, and a decrease in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. In 2006, average dialysis revenue per treatment was impacted by increases in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue) and changes in our commercial and government payor mix, as well as changes in the intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted and non contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average dialysis revenue per treatment in the future. The principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost changes, such as employee benefit costs and insurance costs. Our average clinical hours 38 per treatment have remained stable over the past couple of years primarily because of improved efficiencies driven by reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels previously achieved, and changes in federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. In 2007, our clinical hours per treatment remained stable compared to 2006, however, we did experience an increase in our labor rates per treatment of approximately 3%, as labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. For the past several years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors. In addition, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO provides for specific rebates off of list price and discount pricing based on process improvement and data submission and some combination of these factors, which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to qualify for these rebates and discounts. In 2007, we experienced an increase in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to general increases in rent and repairs and maintenance. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenues over the past three years. However, this reflects a substantial increase in the dollar amount of spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes as well as legal and other professional fees. We expect that the level of general and administrative expenses will be sustained or possibly increased in 2008, in order to continue to support our long term initiatives, including further investments in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Outlook for 2008. Our operating income guidance for 2008, excluding the impact of any potential Medicare legislation, is still projected to be in the range of $790 $850 million; however, we continue to believe that operating income is more likely to be in the lower end of the range for 2008. We are entering into a period of unusual earnings uncertainty. Therefore, the guidance range for 2008 does not capture as high a percentage of the potential outcomes as usual. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks and uncertainties include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors and possible reductions in government payment rates, changes in the structure of and payment rates under Medicare ESRD program which may further reduce Medicare payment rates, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and compliance with the corporate integrity agreement applicable to the dialysis centers acquired from Gambro Healthcare and assumed in connection with such acquisition, and the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the cautionary language contained in the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 36 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. 39 Results of operations Following is a summary of operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. Year ended December 31, Continuing Operations 2007 2006 2005 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, except per treatment data) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 5,264 100 % $ 4,881 100 % $ 2,970 100 % Prior years services laboratory 4 5,264 4,881 2,974 Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 3,590 68 % 3,390 70 % 2,036 69 % General and administrative 491 9 % 454 9 % 272 9 % Depreciation and amortization 193 4 % 173 4 % 117 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 137 3 % 126 2 % 62 2 % Minority interests and equity income, net 45 1 % 36 1 % 22 1 % Valuation gain on alliance and product supply agreement (55 ) (1 )% (38 ) (1 )% Total operating expenses and charges 4,402 84 % 4,141 85 % 2,509 85 % Operating income $ 862 16 % $ 739 15 % $ 465 16 % Dialysis treatments 15,318,995 14,495,796 9,044,966 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 48,942 46,372 28,898 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 324 $ 320 $ 313 Average dialysis revenue per treatment (including the lab) $ 334 $ 330 $ 323 The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results from October 1, 2005. Our operating income margins, increased to 16.4% in 2007 from 15.2% in 2006, primarily due to increases in revenue, an increase in the valuation gain on the alliance and product supply agreement, along with lower benefit costs, lower self insurance costs, as well as a reduction in integration expenditures. Net operating revenues Net operating revenues for current period services increased by approximately 8% in 2007, as compared to 2006 and increased by approximately 64% in 2006, as compared to 2005. The increase in net operating revenues in 2007 was primarily due to an increase of approximately 5% in the number of dialysis treatments, and an increase of approximately 3% in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, additional lab revenue and an increase in revenue from our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. The increase in the number of dialysis treatments in 2007 was primarily due to non acquired growth from existing and new centers and from acquisitions. Our average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $334 increased by approximately $4 in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase in net operating revenues in 2006 was primarily due to the number of dialysis treatments, which accounted for approximately 57% of the increase in revenues, primarily due to the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare effective on October 1, 2005 and the balance from acquisitions and growth in existing and new centers. The remaining 7% increase in total net operating revenues in 2006 was due to increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment and additional management fees and revenues from ancillary services and strategic initiatives. 40 Dialysis revenue, which includes dialysis services and related laboratory services, represented approximately 97%, 98% and 98% of net operating revenues in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including management fee income, accounted for the balance of our total revenues. Dialysis Services Dialysis revenue. The following table summarizes our dialysis revenue by source for the year ended December 31, 2007. RevenuePercentages Outpatient hemodialysis centers 82 % Peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis 9 % Hospital inpatient hemodialysis 6 % Laboratory services 3 % Total dialysis revenue 100 % Major components of dialysis revenue include both the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents slightly more than 30% of total dialysis revenue. Approximately 64% of our total dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 is from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage Plans, representing approximately 87% of our total patients. Our commercial payors consist principally of commercial insurance plans, including more than 1,100 with whom we have contracted rates. Approximately 36% of our dialysis revenue is associated with commercial payors. Approximately 1% of our dialysis services and related dialysis services payments are received directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 5% of total dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007. On average we are generally paid significantly more for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans than we are for patients covered by Medicare or Medicaid. Patients covered by employer group health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As of December 31, 2007, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $149 and $165 per treatment, or an overall average of $157 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our patient care costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates and others of which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. Our contracted commercial payment rates are under downward pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers and we expect this trend to continue into 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2007, our overall commercial rate reductions were in excess of our overall commercial rate increases,. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. Our year over year treatment volume growth was as follows: 2007 2006 Treatment growth related to: Existing and newly opened centers 4.6 % 4.8 % Other center acquisitions 1.1 % 4.0 % DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition effective 10/1/05 % 51.5 % Total treatment growth 5.7 % 60.3 % 41 The annual average dialysis revenue per treatment, including lab services, for continuing operations was approximately $334, $330 and $323 for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2007 was primarily due to an increase in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue) and an increase in the Medicare composite rate, partially offset by a decrease in the government reimbursement for pharmaceuticals associated with the new CMS reimbursement rates for EPO, and a decrease in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. In 2006, the average revenue per treatment was impacted by increases in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue), and changes in our commercial and government payor mix, as well as changes in the intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted and non contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future. Lab revenues. Lab revenues represented approximately 3% of our total net operating revenues for 2007 and 2006. A third party carrier review of Medicare claims associated with our Florida based laboratory was initiated in 1998. No Medicare payments were received for our lab services from the second quarter of 1998 until the third quarter of 2002 while we were appealing the Medicare payment withholds. Following a favorable administrative law judge ruling in 2002, we began receiving prior year Medicare payments in the third quarter of 2002, and received a total of approximately $91 million prior to 2005, and $4 million in 2005. There are no further significant unresolved Medicare lab billing issues. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including management fees, represented approximately 3% of our total net operating revenues in 2007 and approximately 2% in 2006. The increase in ancillary services and strategic initiative revenues were the result of the acquisition of HomeChoice Partners, an infusion therapy company, as well as growth in our pharmacy, vascular access and disease management businesses. Management fee income. Management fee income is included as part of our revenue from ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and represented less than 1% of net operating revenues for 2007 and 2006. We operated or provided administrative services to 23 and 38 third party or non controlled dialysis centers as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We also provided management and administrative services to 48 and 30 physician owned vascular access clinics at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our management fees are principally based on a percentage of the revenue or cash collections of the managed operations, or upon a percentage of operating income. In November 2007, one of our management and administrative services agreements was terminated, pursuant to which we provided management and administrative services to 20 dialysis centers. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and facility costs. As a percentage of current period operating revenues, patient care costs were approximately 68.2% for 2007, 69.5% for 2006 and 68.5% for 2005. On a per treatment basis, patient care costs were flat in 2007 as compared to 2006 and increased by approximately $9 in 2006. The 2007 patient care costs were impacted by an increase in labor costs, higher operating costs of our dialysis centers, as well as an increase in our stock based compensation expense, offset by a decrease in employee benefit costs and workers compensation, lower intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals and a reduction in our professional and general liability insurance costs. The increase in 2006 was principally due to higher labor and benefit costs, increases in expenses 42 related to our strategic initiatives and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The higher labor costs in 2007 and 2006 reflect rising labor rates mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel and the effect of the increase in the number of newly opened centers, which are not yet at normal productivity levels. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers, or the direct costs associated with our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and include expenses for corporate and divisional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions, and regulatory compliance oversight. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of current period operating revenues were 9.3%, 9.3%, and 9.2% in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expense for 2007 was primarily due to higher labor costs, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives and government investigations, stock based compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R), and the timing of certain expenditures, partially offset by lower integration costs related to the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. The absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expense for 2006 was primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives and government investigations, integration costs associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition and stock based compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R). Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was approximately 4% of current period operating revenues for each of the past three years. The absolute dollar increase in depreciation and amortization in 2007 was primarily due to additional centers from acquisitions and newly opened centers. The absolute dollar increase in 2006 was also due to additional centers from acquisitions and newly opened centers, as well as amortization of intangible assets associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, offset by the amortization of the Alliance and Product Supply Agreement as described below. Provision for uncollectible accounts. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was 2.6% for 2007 and 2006 and is expected to remain stable in 2008. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was approximately 2.1% of current period operating revenues for the full year 2005. Minority interests and equity income, net. Minority interests net of equity income increased by approximately $10 million in 2007, and increased by approximately $14 million in 2006. The increases for both years were primarily due to an increase in new dialysis centers having minority partners, growth in the earnings of our joint ventures and an increase in non wholly owned subsidiaries. Product Supply Agreement. We entered into an Alliance and Product Supply Agreement (Product Supply Agreement) with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. on October 5, 2005, in conjunction with our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. The agreement committed us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices through 2015. The agreement was amended on August 25, 2006 (the Amended Product Supply Agreement) to reduce our purchase obligations for certain hemodialysis product supplies and equipment and to allow for the termination of purchase obligations for certain equipment then affected by an import ban issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) if the import ban was not lifted by June 30, 2007. As a result of the reductions in the amount of purchase obligations required under the Amended Product Supply Agreement, we recorded a net valuation gain of $38 million during 2006. This valuation gain represents the difference in the amortized original fair value between the Product Supply Agreement and that of the Amended Product Supply Agreement, as of the effective date of the amendment. On July 2, 2007, we notified Gambro Renal Products, Inc. that we were electing to be permanently relieved of our obligation under the Amended Product Supply Agreement to purchase dialysis machines (the Affected Products) because the Affected Products remained subject to the FDA import ban after June 30, 2007. All other 43 purchase obligations under the Amended Product Supply Agreement, which continues to require us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis non equipment product supplies, such as dialyzers, at fixed prices, remain in place. As a result of the termination of our purchase obligations for the Affected Products, we recorded a net valuation gain of $55 million in 2007. This valuation gain represents the difference in the amortized original fair value of the Amended Product Supply Agreement and that of the Amended Product Supply Agreement as adjusted for the termination of the Affected Products as of June 30, 2007. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses, and our ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. Debt expense Debt expense for 2007, 2006, and 2005 consisted of interest expense of approximately $243 million, $263 million, and $134 million, respectively, amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $10 million in 2007, $10 million in 2006, and $5 million in 2005, and in 2007 and 2006, included the write off of approximately $4 million and $3 million of deferred financing costs associated with the principal prepayments on our term loans. The decrease in interest expense in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to lower average outstanding principal balances during 2007 under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as a result of principal prepayments, and decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Our overall weighted average interest rate in 2007 was 6.49% as compared to 6.64% in 2006. The increase in interest expense in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to additional borrowings outstanding during 2006 under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the increase in the average outstanding balances of our senior and senior subordinated notes, which were issued in March 2005, and increases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Other income Other income, net was approximately $22 million, $13 million, and $9 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, consisted principally of interest income. The increase in other income in 2007 and 2006 was primarily due to an increase in our cash and investments. The increase in 2007 was also due to gains on sale of investments. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2007 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 39.2%, compared with 39.2% and 37.4% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The changes in the effective tax rates in 2006 were primarily due to state income taxes and tax valuation allowance adjustments. We currently project that the effective income tax rate for 2008 will be in the range of 39.0% to 40.0%. Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2007 and 2006 represented approximately 66 and 70 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt provision. The relative decrease in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2007 was a result of improved cash collections. 44 As of December 31, 2007 approximately $23 million in unreserved accounts receivable, representing approximately 2% of our total accounts receivable balance, were more than six months old. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Approximately 1% of our treatments are classified as patient pay. Virtually all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, other than the standard monthly processing, consisted of approximately $31 million and $16 million, respectively, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Currently, our Medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. However, the payment received from Medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. Such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements except for potentially limiting the collectibility of Medicare bad debt claims. DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition On October 5, 2005, we completed our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, Inc. from Gambro, Inc. under a stock purchase agreement dated December 6, 2004, for $3.06 billion. DVA Renal Healthcare was one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers serving approximately 43,000 patients and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our consolidated financial statements from October 1, 2005. Divestitures per Federal Trade Commission Consent Order. As a condition of completing the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, we were required by the Federal Trade Commission to divest a total of 69 outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements. On October 6, 2005, DaVita and DVA Renal Healthcare completed the sale of 71 outpatient renal dialysis centers, and terminated the two management services agreements. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, we completed the sale of three additional centers to Renal Advantage, Inc. that were previously pending state regulatory approval in Illinois. We received total cash consideration of approximately $330 million for all of the centers divested and used approximately $13 million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture, to distribute a minority owners share of the sale proceeds, and to pay related transaction costs. We also paid related income taxes of approximately $85 million on these divestitures during the first quarter of 2006. As part of this transaction, Renal Advantage assumed specific liabilities related to the centers and all other liabilities were retained by us. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers are accounted for as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for 2005. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2007 our cash balance was $447 million and we had undrawn Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $250 million, of which approximately $41 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We also had other undrawn revolving lines of credit totaling $7.2 million associated with several of our joint ventures. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2007 amounted to $533 million, compared with $520 million for 2006. Cash flow from operations in 2007 included cash interest payments of approximately $245 million and cash tax payments of $206 million. Cash flow from operations in 2006 included an income tax payment of approximately $85 million associated with the divestiture of certain centers in conjunction with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, and cash interest payments of $272 million and other cash tax payments of $125 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2007 included $272 million for capital asset expenditures, including $162 million for new center developments and relocations, and an additional $127 million for acquisitions. 45 During 2007 we also received $37 million from the maturity and sale of investments as well as an additional $88 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also repurchased 0.1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $6.4 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2006 included $263 million for capital asset expenditures, including $143 million for new center developments and relocations, and an additional $87 million for acquisitions. In 2006, we received approximately $22 million for the sale of discontinued operations and asset sales. During 2007, we acquired a total of 16 dialysis centers, opened 64 new dialysis centers, sold or closed 6 centers, and discontinued providing management and administrative services to 21 centers. We also acquired a 50% noncontrolling ownership interest in a joint venture that operates six dialysis centers. During 2006 we acquired a total of 26 dialysis centers, including two centers that we previously held a minority owned interest, opened 55 new dialysis centers and divested, sold or closed 14 centers. We currently expect to spend approximately $120 million for general maintenance capital asset expenditures in 2008, and approximately $200 million for new center development, relocations and center acquisitions. Our current projections include opening approximately the same number of centers in 2008 that we opened in 2007. We expect to generate approximately $480 million to $530 million of operating cash flow in 2008. 2007 capital structure changes and other capital items. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain customary affirmative and negative covenants and require compliance with financial covenants, including an interest rate coverage ratio and a leverage ratio that determines the interest rate margins on term loan A and the revolving line of credit. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities in general also contain limits on the general amount of capital expenditures for internal growth, acquisitions and capital improvements, see discussion below, as well as limits on the amount of tangible net assets for non guarantor subsidiaries. During 2007, we made principal payments totaling $50 million on term loan A and $400 million on term loan B. The term loan B payment was made from the proceeds of issuing new senior notes as discussed below. These principal payments were prepayments. As a result of the principal prepayment made in 2007 we wrote off a total of $4.4 million of deferred financing costs, which is included in debt expense. Term Loan A On February 27, 2007, our interest rate margin on term loan A was reduced by 0.25% as a result of achieving certain financial ratios as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Term loan A currently bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall effective rate of 6.35% at December 31, 2007. The interest rate margin is subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term loan A matures in October 2011 and requires annual principal payments of $14.9 million in 2008, $61.3 million in 2009, $87.5 million in 2010 and $65.6 million in 2011, respectively. Term Loan B On February 23, 2007, we amended and restated our existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities to, among other things, reduce the interest rate margin on term loan B by 0.50%, and to amend certain financial covenants. The amended term loan B bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall effective rate of 5.80%, including the impact of our swap agreements, except for the forward interest rate swap agreements, as of December 31, 2007. Other terms that were changed included the amount by which we can elect to increase the revolving and term loan commitments from $500 million to $750 million and certain limitations on purchases, redemptions or acquisitions of capital stock, the payment of dividends and distributions in cash. Further, 46 limitations on capital expenditures for internal growth will not apply during the periods in which our leverage ratio is less than 3.5:1. Our leverage ratio as of December 31, 2007 was less than 3.5:1. We incurred financing costs of $1.8 million which were deferred and also expensed $0.2 million of other costs in connection with this transaction. Term loan B matures in October 2012 and requires principal payments of $1.7 billion in year 2012. Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes On February 23, 2007, we issued $400 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 in a private offering, realizing $405 million in proceeds, which included a $5 million premium, and incurred $2.7 million in related deferred financing costs. These senior notes are part of the same series of debt securities as the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% senior notes that were issued in March 2005. The effective interest rate for the $400 million of 6 5/8% senior notes is 6.45%. The senior notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments which began March 15, 2007. The senior notes may be redeemed by us in whole or part at any time on or after March 15, 2009, at certain specified prices. We used $400 million of these proceeds to pay down our term loan B as discussed above. Our senior and senior subordinated notes, as of December 31, 2007, consisted of $900 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments in March and September. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time as described above and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2007, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $968 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.37% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. In addition, we maintain two forward interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $200 million. These forward interest rate swaps will have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rates to fixed rates of 4.05% and 4.70% on our term loan B outstanding debt. These forward interest rate swaps agreements take effect September 30, 2008, require quarterly interest payments beginning in December 2008, and expire in 2010. During 2007, 2006, and 2005 we accrued net cash benefits (obligations) of approximately $14.5 million, $15.8 million, and $(0.3) million, respectively from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. During 2005, we also incurred additional net cash obligations of $1.5 million from these swaps, which is included in swap valuation gains. We estimate that approximately $0.5 million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2007 will be reclassified into income in 2008. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the total fair value of these swaps was a net liability of $0.5 million, and an asset of $29.5 million, respectively. The 2007 amount was primarily included in other long term liabilities and the 2006 amount was primarily included in other long term assets. Also during 2007 and 2006, we recorded $16.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, net of tax, as reductions to other comprehensive income for valuation losses, net of amounts reclassified into income. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 50% of our variable rate debt and approximately 74% of our total debt economically fixed. As a result of the swap agreements, our overall effective weighted average interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 5.90%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, as of December 31, 2007. 47 At December 31, 2007, our overall average effective interest rate was 6.37%. NxStage Agreement On February 7, 2007, we entered into a National Provider Agreement with NxStage, Inc. The agreement provides us the ability to purchase NxStage home based hemodialysis products at a potential discount depending upon the achievement of certain volume targets. The agreement has an initial term of three years, terminating on December 31, 2009, and may be extended in six month increments up to two additional years if certain volume targets are met. As a part of the agreement, we purchased outright all of our NxStage System One equipment then in use for $5.1 million, and will purchase a majority of our future home based hemodialysis equipment and supplies from NxStage. In connection with the provider agreement, we purchased two million shares of NxStage common stock in a private placement offering for $20 million, representing an ownership position of approximately 7%. We subsequently sold our NxStage Inc. shares, in the second and third quarters of 2007 for approximately $25.9 million and recognized a pre tax gain of $5.9 million or $3.6 million after tax. This pre tax gain is included in other income. Stock based compensation and other equity matters Effective January 1, 2006, we implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R) Share Based Payment, which requires the measurement and recognition of cost for all stock based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, and discounted employee stock purchases. Under SFAS No. 123(R) our stock based compensation awards are measured at estimated fair value on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense over their requisite service periods. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes our previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, under which we did not recognize compensation expense for most of our stock options. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 relating to the application of SFAS No. 123(R), and we have applied the provisions of SAB No. 107 in our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We implemented SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. In accordance with this method, our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to fiscal year 2006 have not been restated to reflect this change. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires that tax benefits realized from stock award exercise gains in excess of stock based compensation expense recognized for financial statement purposes be reported on a prospective basis as cash flows from financing activities rather than as operating cash flows. We also elected to use the method available under Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Staff Position FSP No. 123(R) 3 Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards, which provides an alternative method for calculating historical excess tax benefits from the method described in SFAS No. 123(R) for stock based compensation awards. Under SFAS No. 123(R), stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of the stock based award vesting during that period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for 2007 and 2006 includes compensation cost for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of, December 31, 2005 and subsequent stock based awards granted through December 31, 2006 and 2007. Prior to 2006, we recognized the effect of stock unit forfeitures as they occurred, and the effect of transitioning to recognition of expense based on expected forfeitures was insignificant. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in 2007, 2006 and all prior periods. 48 For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we recognized $34.1 million and $26.4 million, respectively, in stock based compensation expense for stock options, stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock units and discounted employee stock plan purchases, which is primarily included in general and administrative expenses in continuing operations. The estimated tax benefits recorded for this stock based compensation in 2007 and 2006 were $12.8 million and $9.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, there was $78.6 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.6 years. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we received $54.7 million and $37.9 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $32.8 million and $40.4 million, respectively, in total actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. On May 29, 2007, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to increase the number of shares of authorized common stock from 195,000,000 to 450,000,000 shares. Our stockholders also approved an amendment and restatement of our Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under that plan by 800,001 shares, and approved an amendment and restatement of our 2002 Equity Compensation Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under that plan by 6,000,000 shares and, among other things, to remove certain available share recycling features, to change the limit on the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be subject to awards granted to any single recipient in any consecutive twenty four month period so that it applies only to awards of stock options and stock appreciation rights, and to provide additional exceptions from the three year minimum vesting period generally applicable to grants of restricted stock units and other full share awards. 2006 capital structure changes. During 2006, we made principal payments totaling $62 million on our term loan A and $338 million on term loan B which included mandatory principal payments of $35 million and $24.5 million respectively. All of the mandatory principal payments were paid in advance of the scheduled payment dates in 2006. As a result of the principal prepayment made in 2006, we wrote off approximately $3.3 million of deferred financing costs, which is included in debt expense. On March 1, 2006, our interest rate margins on our term loan A and term loan B were reduced by 0.25% as a result of achieving certain financial ratios as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. At December 31, 2006, the term loan A interest rate was based on LIBOR plus 1.75% and the term loan B interest rate was based on LIBOR plus 2.00%. The margins were subject to adjustment depending upon changes in our financial ratios and could have ranged from 1.50% to 2.25% for the revolving line of credit and term loan A, and 2.00% to 2.25% for term loan B. As of December 31, 2006, our senior and senior subordinated notes consisted of $500 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. As of December 31, 2006, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1,341 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.88%, on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 2.00%. The swap agreements require quarterly interest payments, bear amortizing notional amounts, and expire in 2008 through 2010. As of December 31, 2006, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 56% of our variable rate debt and approximately 72% of our total debt. 49 As a result of the swap agreements at December 31, 2006, our overall effective weighted average interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 6.61%, based upon the current margins in effect ranging from 1.75% to 2.00%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.76%. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers and for some of our non wholly owned subsidiaries, in the form of put provisions, which are exercisable at the third party owners future discretion. These put provisions, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the equity interest put to us, which approximates fair value. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several other third party owned centers, noncontrolling owned centers and physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2007 (in millions): Less Than1 year 1 3years 3 5years After5 years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 22 $ 152 $ 1,772 $ 1,750 $ 3,696 Interest payments on senior and senior subordinated notes 121 243 243 183 790 Capital lease obligations 1 1 1 4 7 Operating leases 170 288 223 336 1,017 FIN No. 48 tax liabilities 4 9 4 17 $ 318 $ 693 $ 2,243 $ 2,273 $ 5,527 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 41 $ 41 Acquisition of dialysis centers 131 99 54 46 330 Working capital advances to third parties under administrative services agreements 18 18 $ 190 $ 99 $ 54 $ 46 $ 389 Not included above are interest payments related to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2007 bear interest at LIBOR plus current margins of 1.50%. The term loan A and the revolving line of credit are adjustable depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2007, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities had an overall effective weighted average interest rate of 5.90%, including the effects of our swap agreements. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific debt tranches within each term loan, which can range in maturity from one month to twelve months. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of mandatory principal payments and principal prepayments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no principal prepayments on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities during 2008 and no changes in the effective interest rate, approximately $116 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2008. Our Amended Alliance and Product Supply Agreement with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. (the Amended Product Supply Agreement) requires us to purchase a significant majority of certain hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices through 2015. On July 2, 2007, we notified Gambro Renal Products, Inc. that we were electing to be permanently relieved of our purchase obligation under the Amended 50 Product Supply Agreement to purchase dialysis machines (the Affected Products) because the Affected Products remained subject to an FDA import ban after June 30, 2007. Our total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 on products under the Amended Product Supply Agreement were approximately 2% and 4%, respectively, of our total operating costs. The actual amount of purchases in future years under the Amended Product Supply Agreement will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating and capital requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, and Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. Settlements of approximately $11.0 million of existing FASB Interpretation 48 (FIN 48) liabilities are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made. Contingencies The majority of our revenues are from government programs and may be subject to adjustment as a result of: (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; and (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements. In addition, our revenues from commercial payors may be subject to adjustment as a result of potential claims for refunds, as a result of government actions or as a result of other claims by commercial payors. United States Attorney inquiries In February 2007, we received a request for information from the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, for records relating to Epogen&reg;, or EPO, claims submitted to Medicare. In August 2007, we received a subpoena from the OIG seeking similar documents. The requested documents relate to services provided from 2001 to 2004 by a number of our centers. The request and subpoena were sent from the OIGs offices in Houston and Dallas, Texas. We are cooperating with the inquiry and are producing the requested records. We have been in contact with the United States Attorneys Office, or U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Eastern District of Texas, which has stated that this is a civil inquiry related to EPO claims. There appears to be substantial overlap between this issue and the ongoing review of EPO utilization and claims by the U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis described below. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoena will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. On March 4, 2005, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. The subpoena requires production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including documents related to, among other things, pharmaceutical and other services provided to patients, relationships with pharmaceutical companies, and financial relationships with physicians and joint ventures. The subpoena covers the period from December 1, 1996 through the present. In October 2005, we received a follow up request for additional documents related to specific medical director and joint venture arrangements. In February 2006, we received an additional subpoena for documents, including certain patient records relating to the administration and billing of EPO. In May 2007, we received a request for documents related to durable medical equipment (DME) and supply companies owned and operated by us. We are producing documents and providing information to the government. We are also cooperating, and intend to continue to cooperate, with the governments investigation, including by participating in discussions and meetings with the government. The subpoenas have been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in 51 substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as this to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoenas will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. On October 25, 2004, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. The subpoena covers the period from 1996 to present and requires the production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including DaVita Laboratory Services. Gambro Healthcare received a similar subpoena in November 2004. The subpoena also includes specific requests for documents relating to testing for PTH levels and to products relating to vitamin D therapies. The subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena, including Fresenius Medical Group. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoena may continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. Other We have received several notices of claims from commercial payors and other third parties related to historical billing practices and claims against DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare) related to historical Gambro Healthcare billing practices and other matters covered by their settlement agreement with the Department of Justice. At least one commercial payor has filed an arbitration demand against us, as described below, and additional commercial payors have threatened litigation. We intend to defend against these claims vigorously; however, we may not be successful and these claims may lead to litigation and any such litigation may be resolved unfavorably. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted at this time, an adverse result in excess of our established reserves, with respect to one or more of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In December 2007, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the State of New York to resolve certain billing issues that had been the subject of inquiry by the New York Attorney Generals Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, or MFCU. We had received several informal inquiries from representatives of the MFCU regarding billing practices for facilities managed by us in New York. The Settlement Agreement covers numerous dialysis facilities in New York for which we, through our subsidiaries, provide administrative services. We paid approximately $1.5 million in settlement, which included the amount of the overpayments by the New York Medicaid program plus interest; no fines or penalties were assessed. In October 2007, we were contacted by the Attorney Generals Office for the State of Nevada. The Attorney Generals Office informed us that it was conducting a criminal investigation of our operations in Nevada and that the investigation related to the billing of pharmaceuticals, including EPO. On February 8, 2008, the Attorney Generals Office informed us that the criminal investigation has been discontinued. The Attorney Generals Office further advised us that Nevada Medicaid intends to conduct audits of ESRD providers in Nevada, including us, and that such audits will relate to the issues that were the subjects of the criminal investigation. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. On August 28, 2007, Sheet Metal Workers National Health Fund and Glenn Randle filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against us. The complaint also names as 52 defendants Amgen, Inc. and Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. The complaint is styled as a class action and alleges four claims against us, including violations of the federal RICO statute, Californias unfair competition law, Californias false advertising law and for unjust enrichment. The complaints principal allegations against us are that the defendants engaged in a scheme to unlawfully promote the administration of EPO to hemodialysis patients intravenously, as opposed to subcutaneously, and to over utilize EPO. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or the potential range of damages, if any. On August 8, 2005, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against Gambro AB, DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly Gambro Healthcare) and related entities. The plaintiff sought to bring its claims as a class action on behalf of itself and all entities that paid any of the defendants for health care goods and services from on or about January 1991 through at least December 2004. The complaint alleged, among other things, damages resulting from facts and circumstances underlying Gambro Healthcares December 2004 settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States Government. In March 2006, the case was dismissed and the plaintiff was compelled to seek arbitration to resolve the matter. In November 2006, the plaintiff filed a demand for class arbitration against us and DVA Renal Healthcare. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or the potential range of damages, if any. In June 2004, Gambro Healthcare was served with a complaint filed in the Superior Court of California by one of its former employees who worked for its California acute services program. The complaint, which is styled as a class action, alleges, among other things, that DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly Gambro Healthcare) failed to provide overtime wages, defined rest periods and meal periods, or compensation in lieu of such provisions and failed to comply with certain other California labor code requirements. We intend to vigorously defend against this claim. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted, we do not expect that an unfavorable result, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits, including from time to time, contractual disputes and professional and general liability claims, as well as audits and investigations by various government entities, in the ordinary course of business. We believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly variable compensation accruals, purchase accounting valuation estimates and stock based compensation are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize in a reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant 53 uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the more than 1,100 commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 107,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk to be within 1% of total revenue, which can represent as much as 6.0% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments in third party dialysis businesses, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually, and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. 54 Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year, and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties, which went effective January 1, 2007, we assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain and future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. We make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Long lived tangible and intangible assets are subject to our regular ongoing impairment assessments. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based awards to employees and directors in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payments. Under SFAS No. 123(R), stock based compensation is recognized during a period based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of the stock based award vesting during that period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 includes compensation costs for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of December 31, 2005, and stock based awards granted in those years. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk free interest rates. Significant new accounting standards On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements except for the nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are subject to a one year deferral allowed by FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS157 2 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157. This standard establishes a framework for measuring fair value and also requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard applies to assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. On February 12, 2008, FSP FAS157 2 was issued delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 157 until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The implementation of this standard relating to the assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159 Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of SFAS No. 115. This standard allows companies the alternative to measure 55 certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis that are currently not required to be measured at fair value. The standard is also designed to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R) Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations. This standard requires all business combinations to be accounted for under the acquisition method (previously referred to as the purchase method). Under the acquisition method, the acquirer recognizes the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date. Noncontractual contingencies are recognized at the acquisition date at their fair values only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6 Elements of Financial Statements. Transaction costs are excluded from the acquisition accounting and will be expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration included by the acquirer as part of the purchase price must also be measured at fair value at the acquisition date and will be classified as either equity or a liability. This standard also requires a company that obtains control but acquires less than 100% of an acquiree to record 100% of the fair value of the acquiree assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests at the acquisition date. This standard is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently in the process of assessing the expected impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160 Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, which amends Accounting Research Bulletin, No. 51 Consolidated Financial Statements. This standard requires noncontrolling interests to be treated as a separate component of equity, but apart from the parents equity and not as a liability, or an item outside of equity. This will eliminate diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and its noncontrolling interests. This standard also specifies that consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income, and that changes in the parents ownership interest while it retains a controlling financial interest should be accounted for as equity transactions. This standard also expands disclosures in the financial statements to include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the equity attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling owners and a schedule showing the effects of changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary on the equity attributable to the parent. This standard is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently in the process of assessing the expected impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with SFAS Statement No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement attribute on all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in order to be recognized in the financial statements. In making this assessment, a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position and must assume that the tax position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. Once the recognition threshold is met, the tax position is then measured to determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. In addition, the recognition threshold of more likely than not must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of the tax benefit. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. See note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of adopting this interpretation. 56 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2007. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average LIBOR rates plus margins in effect at the end of 2007 including the economic effects of our swap agreements. Term loan A and revolving line of credit interest rate margins are subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio. The margins currently in effect at December 31, 2007 were 1.50%. For our interest rate swap agreements, the table below presents the notional amounts by contract maturity date and the related interest rate terms of the agreements (to pay fixed rates, and to receive LIBOR). Expected maturity date Total FairValue Averageinterestrate 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 4 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 $ 0 $ 1,753 $ 1,760 $ 1,755 6.89 % Variable rate $ 20 $ 63 $ 88 $ 66 $ 1,706 $ $ 1,943 $ 1,943 5.91 % Notionalamount Contract maturity date Pay fixed Receivevariable Fairvalue 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 (dollars in millions) Swaps: Pay fixed swaps $ 968 $ 378 $ 401 $ 189 $ $ 3.08% to 4.27% LIBOR $ 2.2 Forward pay fixed swaps $ 200 $ $ $ 200 $ $ 4.05% to 4.70% LIBOR $ (2.7 ) As of December 31, 2007, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $968 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.37% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. In addition, we maintain two forward interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $200 million. These forward interest rate swaps will have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rates to fixed rates of 4.05% and 4.70% on our term loan B outstanding debt. These forward interest rate swaps agreements take effect September 30, 2008, require quarterly interest payments beginning in December 2008, and expire in 2010. During 2007, we accrued net cash benefits of $14.5 million from these swaps which is included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2007, the total fair value of these swaps was a net liability of $0.5 million. During 2007, we recorded $16.0 million, net of tax, as a reduction to other comprehensive income for valuation losses, net of amounts reclassified into income. As of December 31, 2007, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 50% of our variable rate debt and approximately 74% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements, the overall effective weighted average interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 5.90%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50% as of December 31, 2007. Our overall average effective interest rate during 2007 was 6.49% and as of December 31, 2007 was 6.37%. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis 57 points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $5.5 million, $6.8 million, and $3.2 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Forward looking statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements that do not concern historical facts are forward looking statements and include, among other things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, operating cash flow, estimated tax rates, capital expenditures, the development of new centers and center acquisitions, revenue estimating risk and our related level of indebtedness on our financial performance, including earnings per share. These statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements, including, but not limited to, risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors and possible reductions in government payment rates, changes in the structure of and payment rates under the Medicare ESRD program which may further reduce Medicare payment rates, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and compliance with the corporate integrity agreement applicable to the dialysis centers acquired from Gambro Healthcare and assumed in connection with such acquisition, the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies, and the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,359 outpatient dialysis centers and 700 hospitals, serving approximately 107,000 patients in 43 states. In 2007, our overall network of dialysis centers increased by 59 centers primarily as a result of opening new centers and acquisitions and the overall number of patients that we serve increased by approximately 4%. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three areas, our patients, our business partners, and our teammates, represents the major drivers of our potential long term success, although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes as measured by DQI have improved over each of the past three years, and we are pleased with our 2007 clinical outcomes. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. In addition, over the past couple of years we have achieved reductions in teammate turnover, which have been a major contributor to our clinical performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. Approximately 97% of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis and dialysis related services, such as laboratory services (collectively dialysis revenue). Eighty two percent of our dialysis revenue is derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in 1,336 centers that we consolidate that are either wholly owned 36 or majority owned. Other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services, which combined accounted for approximately 15% of our dialysis revenue, and the remaining 3% of our dialysis revenue was from laboratory services. Our other operations include various ancillary services and strategic initiatives consisting primarily of infusion therapy services, oral pharmacy services, vascular access services, disease management services and special needs plans, ESRD clinical research programs, and management and administration services to noncontrolling owned and third party owned centers and clinics, as further described in Item 1 in this Form 10 K. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our patients. These services generated approximately 3% of our total net revenues in 2007. We currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives as we work to develop strategically successful new business operations. However, significant changes in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may ultimately impact or continue to impact the economic viability of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes could result in a write off of some or all of our investments in these strategic initiatives. The principal drivers of our dialysis revenue are: (a) the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week, as well as the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services, (b) average dialysis revenue per treatment revenue and c) laboratory patient testing. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our ability to open and acquire new centers. Our year over year treatment volume growth was 5.7% in 2007. Average dialysis revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, dialysis services charge capture, and our billing and collecting operations performance. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are generally significantly higher than Medicare and Medicaid payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment. The following table summarizes our dialysis revenue and patient percentages by payor type for the year ended December 31, 2007: Revenues PatientPercentages Medicare and Medicare assigned HMO plans 58 % 80 % Medicaid 4 % 5 % Other government based programs 2 % 2 % Total government based programs 64 % 87 % Commercial 36 % 13 % Total dialysis revenue 100 % 100 % Government payment rates are principally determined by federal (Medicare) and state (Medicaid) policy. These payment rates have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of being reduced. Cumulative net increases in Medicare payment rates from 1990 through 2007 totaled approximately 10%. There were no Medicare payment rate increases for 2003 and 2004. CMS implemented increases of 1.6% on April 1, 2007, January 1, 2006 and January 1, 2005, however the 2005 increase was more than offset by other structural 37 changes to Medicare dialysis payment rates that also became effective January 1, 2005. Medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures. Commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are at contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Over the past several years we were successful in maintaining relatively stable average payment rates in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases. However, we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors and certain payors have become increasingly aggressive in their negotiations. In the fourth quarter of 2007, our overall commercial rate reductions were in excess of our overall commercial rate increases. We continue to expect downward pressure from payors on our contracted commercial payment rates as a result of general market conditions, recent and future consolidations among commercial payors, increased focus on dialysis services and other factors. In addition, payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations on non contracted or out of network providers, which could further decrease our commercial rate revenues. Slightly more than 30% of our dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007, has been associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for slightly more than 20% of our dialysis revenue. Therefore, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in private and governmental payment rates for EPO significantly influence our revenue levels. For example, in July 2007, CMS implemented a new reimbursement methodology for EPO which decreased our dialysis revenue per treatment and effective January 2008, changes to the EPO monitoring policy went into effect which further limit reimbursement and which have impacted the prescribing habits of our physicians. Such changes, as well as the reduction in some of our contracted commercial payment rates negatively impacted our average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2007. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services charge capture and billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average dialysis revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past several years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. In 2007, we began integrating our billing systems into one system. Systems upgrades will continue in 2008 and could impact our collection performance as well as our dialysis revenue per treatment. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis revenue per treatment including lab services for continuing operations was approximately $334, $330 and $323 for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2007 was primarily due to an increase in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue) and an increase in the Medicare composite rate, partially offset by a decrease in the government reimbursement for pharmaceuticals associated with the new CMS reimbursement rates for EPO, and a decrease in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. In 2006, average dialysis revenue per treatment was impacted by increases in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue) and changes in our commercial and government payor mix, as well as changes in the intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted and non contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average dialysis revenue per treatment in the future. The principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost changes, such as employee benefit costs and insurance costs. Our average clinical hours 38 per treatment have remained stable over the past couple of years primarily because of improved efficiencies driven by reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels previously achieved, and changes in federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. In 2007, our clinical hours per treatment remained stable compared to 2006, however, we did experience an increase in our labor rates per treatment of approximately 3%, as labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. For the past several years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors. In addition, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO provides for specific rebates off of list price and discount pricing based on process improvement and data submission and some combination of these factors, which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to qualify for these rebates and discounts. In 2007, we experienced an increase in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to general increases in rent and repairs and maintenance. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenues over the past three years. However, this reflects a substantial increase in the dollar amount of spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes as well as legal and other professional fees. We expect that the level of general and administrative expenses will be sustained or possibly increased in 2008, in order to continue to support our long term initiatives, including further investments in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Outlook for 2008. Our operating income guidance for 2008, excluding the impact of any potential Medicare legislation, is still projected to be in the range of $790 $850 million; however, we continue to believe that operating income is more likely to be in the lower end of the range for 2008. We are entering into a period of unusual earnings uncertainty. Therefore, the guidance range for 2008 does not capture as high a percentage of the potential outcomes as usual. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks and uncertainties include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors and possible reductions in government payment rates, changes in the structure of and payment rates under Medicare ESRD program which may further reduce Medicare payment rates, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and compliance with the corporate integrity agreement applicable to the dialysis centers acquired from Gambro Healthcare and assumed in connection with such acquisition, and the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies.

Year ended December 31, Continuing Operations 2007 2006 2005 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, except per treatment data) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 5,264 100 % $ 4,881 100 % $ 2,970 100 % Prior years services laboratory 4 5,264 4,881 2,974 Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 3,590 68 % 3,390 70 % 2,036 69 % General and administrative 491 9 % 454 9 % 272 9 % Depreciation and amortization 193 4 % 173 4 % 117 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 137 3 % 126 2 % 62 2 % Minority interests and equity income, net 45 1 % 36 1 % 22 1 % Valuation gain on alliance and product supply agreement (55 ) (1 )% (38 ) (1 )% Total operating expenses and charges 4,402 84 % 4,141 85 % 2,509 85 % Operating income $ 862 16 % $ 739 15 % $ 465 16 % Dialysis treatments 15,318,995 14,495,796 9,044,966 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 48,942 46,372 28,898 Average dialysis revenue per treatment $ 324 $ 320 $ 313 Average dialysis revenue per treatment (including the lab) $ 334 $ 330 $ 323 The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results from October 1, 2005. Our operating income margins, increased to 16.4% in 2007 from 15.2% in 2006, primarily due to increases in revenue, an increase in the valuation gain on the alliance and product supply agreement, along with lower benefit costs, lower self insurance costs, as well as a reduction in integration expenditures. Net operating revenues Net operating revenues for current period services increased by approximately 8% in 2007, as compared to 2006 and increased by approximately 64% in 2006, as compared to 2005. The increase in net operating revenues in 2007 was primarily due to an increase of approximately 5% in the number of dialysis treatments, and an increase of approximately 3% in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, additional lab revenue and an increase in revenue from our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. The increase in the number of dialysis treatments in 2007 was primarily due to non acquired growth from existing and new centers and from acquisitions. Our average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $334 increased by approximately $4 in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase in net operating revenues in 2006 was primarily due to the number of dialysis treatments, which accounted for approximately 57% of the increase in revenues, primarily due to the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare effective on October 1, 2005 and the balance from acquisitions and growth in existing and new centers. The remaining 7% increase in total net operating revenues in 2006 was due to increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment and additional management fees and revenues from ancillary services and strategic initiatives. 40 Dialysis revenue, which includes dialysis services and related laboratory services, represented approximately 97%, 98% and 98% of net operating revenues in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including management fee income, accounted for the balance of our total revenues. Dialysis Services Dialysis revenue. The following table summarizes our dialysis revenue by source for the year ended December 31, 2007. RevenuePercentages Outpatient hemodialysis centers 82 % Peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis 9 % Hospital inpatient hemodialysis 6 % Laboratory services 3 % Total dialysis revenue 100 % Major components of dialysis revenue include both the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents slightly more than 30% of total dialysis revenue. Approximately 64% of our total dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 is from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage Plans, representing approximately 87% of our total patients. Our commercial payors consist principally of commercial insurance plans, including more than 1,100 with whom we have contracted rates. Approximately 36% of our dialysis revenue is associated with commercial payors. Approximately 1% of our dialysis services and related dialysis services payments are received directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 5% of total dialysis revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007. On average we are generally paid significantly more for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans than we are for patients covered by Medicare or Medicaid. Patients covered by employer group health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As of December 31, 2007, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $149 and $165 per treatment, or an overall average of $157 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our patient care costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates and others of which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. Our contracted commercial payment rates are under downward pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers and we expect this trend to continue into 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2007, our overall commercial rate reductions were in excess of our overall commercial rate increases,. Additionally, as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. Our year over year treatment volume growth was as follows: 2007 2006 Treatment growth related to: Existing and newly opened centers 4.6 % 4.8 % Other center acquisitions 1.1 % 4.0 % DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition effective 10/1/05 % 51.5 % Total treatment growth 5.7 % 60.3 % 41 The annual average dialysis revenue per treatment, including lab services, for continuing operations was approximately $334, $330 and $323 for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2007 was primarily due to an increase in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue) and an increase in the Medicare composite rate, partially offset by a decrease in the government reimbursement for pharmaceuticals associated with the new CMS reimbursement rates for EPO, and a decrease in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. In 2006, the average revenue per treatment was impacted by increases in our standard fee schedules (principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue), and changes in our commercial and government payor mix, as well as changes in the intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted and non contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future. Lab revenues. Lab revenues represented approximately 3% of our total net operating revenues for 2007 and 2006. A third party carrier review of Medicare claims associated with our Florida based laboratory was initiated in 1998. No Medicare payments were received for our lab services from the second quarter of 1998 until the third quarter of 2002 while we were appealing the Medicare payment withholds. Following a favorable administrative law judge ruling in 2002, we began receiving prior year Medicare payments in the third quarter of 2002, and received a total of approximately $91 million prior to 2005, and $4 million in 2005. There are no further significant unresolved Medicare lab billing issues. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including management fees, represented approximately 3% of our total net operating revenues in 2007 and approximately 2% in 2006. The increase in ancillary services and strategic initiative revenues were the result of the acquisition of HomeChoice Partners, an infusion therapy company, as well as growth in our pharmacy, vascular access and disease management businesses. Management fee income. Management fee income is included as part of our revenue from ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and represented less than 1% of net operating revenues for 2007 and 2006. We operated or provided administrative services to 23 and 38 third party or non controlled dialysis centers as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We also provided management and administrative services to 48 and 30 physician owned vascular access clinics at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our management fees are principally based on a percentage of the revenue or cash collections of the managed operations, or upon a percentage of operating income. In November 2007, one of our management and administrative services agreements was terminated, pursuant to which we provided management and administrative services to 20 dialysis centers. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations, and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and facility costs. As a percentage of current period operating revenues, patient care costs were approximately 68.2% for 2007, 69.5% for 2006 and 68.5% for 2005. On a per treatment basis, patient care costs were flat in 2007 as compared to 2006 and increased by approximately $9 in 2006. The 2007 patient care costs were impacted by an increase in labor costs, higher operating costs of our dialysis centers, as well as an increase in our stock based compensation expense, offset by a decrease in employee benefit costs and workers compensation, lower intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals and a reduction in our professional and general liability insurance costs. The increase in 2006 was principally due to higher labor and benefit costs, increases in expenses 42 related to our strategic initiatives and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. The higher labor costs in 2007 and 2006 reflect rising labor rates mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel and the effect of the increase in the number of newly opened centers, which are not yet at normal productivity levels. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers, or the direct costs associated with our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and include expenses for corporate and divisional administration, including centralized accounting, billing and cash collection functions, and regulatory compliance oversight. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of current period operating revenues were 9.3%, 9.3%, and 9.2% in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expense for 2007 was primarily due to higher labor costs, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives and government investigations, stock based compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R), and the timing of certain expenditures, partially offset by lower integration costs related to the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition. The absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expense for 2006 was primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs, professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives and government investigations, integration costs associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition and stock based compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R). Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was approximately 4% of current period operating revenues for each of the past three years. The absolute dollar increase in depreciation and amortization in 2007 was primarily due to additional centers from acquisitions and newly opened centers. The absolute dollar increase in 2006 was also due to additional centers from acquisitions and newly opened centers, as well as amortization of intangible assets associated with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, offset by the amortization of the Alliance and Product Supply Agreement as described below. Provision for uncollectible accounts. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was 2.6% for 2007 and 2006 and is expected to remain stable in 2008. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was approximately 2.1% of current period operating revenues for the full year 2005. Minority interests and equity income, net. Minority interests net of equity income increased by approximately $10 million in 2007, and increased by approximately $14 million in 2006. The increases for both years were primarily due to an increase in new dialysis centers having minority partners, growth in the earnings of our joint ventures and an increase in non wholly owned subsidiaries. Product Supply Agreement. We entered into an Alliance and Product Supply Agreement (Product Supply Agreement) with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. on October 5, 2005, in conjunction with our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. The agreement committed us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices through 2015. The agreement was amended on August 25, 2006 (the Amended Product Supply Agreement) to reduce our purchase obligations for certain hemodialysis product supplies and equipment and to allow for the termination of purchase obligations for certain equipment then affected by an import ban issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) if the import ban was not lifted by June 30, 2007. As a result of the reductions in the amount of purchase obligations required under the Amended Product Supply Agreement, we recorded a net valuation gain of $38 million during 2006. This valuation gain represents the difference in the amortized original fair value between the Product Supply Agreement and that of the Amended Product Supply Agreement, as of the effective date of the amendment. On July 2, 2007, we notified Gambro Renal Products, Inc. that we were electing to be permanently relieved of our obligation under the Amended Product Supply Agreement to purchase dialysis machines (the Affected Products) because the Affected Products remained subject to the FDA import ban after June 30, 2007. All other 43 purchase obligations under the Amended Product Supply Agreement, which continues to require us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis non equipment product supplies, such as dialyzers, at fixed prices, remain in place. As a result of the termination of our purchase obligations for the Affected Products, we recorded a net valuation gain of $55 million in 2007. This valuation gain represents the difference in the amortized original fair value of the Amended Product Supply Agreement and that of the Amended Product Supply Agreement as adjusted for the termination of the Affected Products as of June 30, 2007. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses, and our ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. Debt expense Debt expense for 2007, 2006, and 2005 consisted of interest expense of approximately $243 million, $263 million, and $134 million, respectively, amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $10 million in 2007, $10 million in 2006, and $5 million in 2005, and in 2007 and 2006, included the write off of approximately $4 million and $3 million of deferred financing costs associated with the principal prepayments on our term loans. The decrease in interest expense in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to lower average outstanding principal balances during 2007 under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as a result of principal prepayments, and decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Our overall weighted average interest rate in 2007 was 6.49% as compared to 6.64% in 2006. The increase in interest expense in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to additional borrowings outstanding during 2006 under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the increase in the average outstanding balances of our senior and senior subordinated notes, which were issued in March 2005, and increases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Other income Other income, net was approximately $22 million, $13 million, and $9 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, consisted principally of interest income. The increase in other income in 2007 and 2006 was primarily due to an increase in our cash and investments. The increase in 2007 was also due to gains on sale of investments. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes for 2007 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 39.2%, compared with 39.2% and 37.4% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The changes in the effective tax rates in 2006 were primarily due to state income taxes and tax valuation allowance adjustments. We currently project that the effective income tax rate for 2008 will be in the range of 39.0% to 40.0%. Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2007 and 2006 represented approximately 66 and 70 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt provision. The relative decrease in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2007 was a result of improved cash collections. 44 As of December 31, 2007 approximately $23 million in unreserved accounts receivable, representing approximately 2% of our total accounts receivable balance, were more than six months old. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Approximately 1% of our treatments are classified as patient pay. Virtually all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, other than the standard monthly processing, consisted of approximately $31 million and $16 million, respectively, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Currently, our Medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. However, the payment received from Medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. Such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements except for potentially limiting the collectibility of Medicare bad debt claims. DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition On October 5, 2005, we completed our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare, Inc. from Gambro, Inc. under a stock purchase agreement dated December 6, 2004, for $3.06 billion. DVA Renal Healthcare was one of the largest dialysis service providers in the United States, operating 566 outpatient dialysis centers serving approximately 43,000 patients and generating annual revenues of approximately $2 billion. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our consolidated financial statements from October 1, 2005. Divestitures per Federal Trade Commission Consent Order. As a condition of completing the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, we were required by the Federal Trade Commission to divest a total of 69 outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements. On October 6, 2005, DaVita and DVA Renal Healthcare completed the sale of 71 outpatient renal dialysis centers, and terminated the two management services agreements. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, we completed the sale of three additional centers to Renal Advantage, Inc. that were previously pending state regulatory approval in Illinois. We received total cash consideration of approximately $330 million for all of the centers divested and used approximately $13 million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture, to distribute a minority owners share of the sale proceeds, and to pay related transaction costs. We also paid related income taxes of approximately $85 million on these divestitures during the first quarter of 2006. As part of this transaction, Renal Advantage assumed specific liabilities related to the centers and all other liabilities were retained by us. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers are accounted for as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for 2005. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2007 our cash balance was $447 million and we had undrawn Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $250 million, of which approximately $41 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We also had other undrawn revolving lines of credit totaling $7.2 million associated with several of our joint ventures. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2007 amounted to $533 million, compared with $520 million for 2006. Cash flow from operations in 2007 included cash interest payments of approximately $245 million and cash tax payments of $206 million. Cash flow from operations in 2006 included an income tax payment of approximately $85 million associated with the divestiture of certain centers in conjunction with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, and cash interest payments of $272 million and other cash tax payments of $125 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2007 included $272 million for capital asset expenditures, including $162 million for new center developments and relocations, and an additional $127 million for acquisitions. 45 During 2007 we also received $37 million from the maturity and sale of investments as well as an additional $88 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also repurchased 0.1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $6.4 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2006 included $263 million for capital asset expenditures, including $143 million for new center developments and relocations, and an additional $87 million for acquisitions. In 2006, we received approximately $22 million for the sale of discontinued operations and asset sales. During 2007, we acquired a total of 16 dialysis centers, opened 64 new dialysis centers, sold or closed 6 centers, and discontinued providing management and administrative services to 21 centers. We also acquired a 50% noncontrolling ownership interest in a joint venture that operates six dialysis centers. During 2006 we acquired a total of 26 dialysis centers, including two centers that we previously held a minority owned interest, opened 55 new dialysis centers and divested, sold or closed 14 centers. We currently expect to spend approximately $120 million for general maintenance capital asset expenditures in 2008, and approximately $200 million for new center development, relocations and center acquisitions. Our current projections include opening approximately the same number of centers in 2008 that we opened in 2007. We expect to generate approximately $480 million to $530 million of operating cash flow in 2008. 2007 capital structure changes and other capital items. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain customary affirmative and negative covenants and require compliance with financial covenants, including an interest rate coverage ratio and a leverage ratio that determines the interest rate margins on term loan A and the revolving line of credit. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities in general also contain limits on the general amount of capital expenditures for internal growth, acquisitions and capital improvements, see discussion below, as well as limits on the amount of tangible net assets for non guarantor subsidiaries. During 2007, we made principal payments totaling $50 million on term loan A and $400 million on term loan B. The term loan B payment was made from the proceeds of issuing new senior notes as discussed below. These principal payments were prepayments. As a result of the principal prepayment made in 2007 we wrote off a total of $4.4 million of deferred financing costs, which is included in debt expense. Term Loan A On February 27, 2007, our interest rate margin on term loan A was reduced by 0.25% as a result of achieving certain financial ratios as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Term loan A currently bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall effective rate of 6.35% at December 31, 2007. The interest rate margin is subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term loan A matures in October 2011 and requires annual principal payments of $14.9 million in 2008, $61.3 million in 2009, $87.5 million in 2010 and $65.6 million in 2011, respectively. Term Loan B On February 23, 2007, we amended and restated our existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities to, among other things, reduce the interest rate margin on term loan B by 0.50%, and to amend certain financial covenants. The amended term loan B bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall effective rate of 5.80%, including the impact of our swap agreements, except for the forward interest rate swap agreements, as of December 31, 2007. Other terms that were changed included the amount by which we can elect to increase the revolving and term loan commitments from $500 million to $750 million and certain limitations on purchases, redemptions or acquisitions of capital stock, the payment of dividends and distributions in cash. Further, 46 limitations on capital expenditures for internal growth will not apply during the periods in which our leverage ratio is less than 3.5:1. Our leverage ratio as of December 31, 2007 was less than 3.5:1. We incurred financing costs of $1.8 million which were deferred and also expensed $0.2 million of other costs in connection with this transaction. Term loan B matures in October 2012 and requires principal payments of $1.7 billion in year 2012. Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes On February 23, 2007, we issued $400 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 in a private offering, realizing $405 million in proceeds, which included a $5 million premium, and incurred $2.7 million in related deferred financing costs. These senior notes are part of the same series of debt securities as the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% senior notes that were issued in March 2005. The effective interest rate for the $400 million of 6 5/8% senior notes is 6.45%. The senior notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments which began March 15, 2007. The senior notes may be redeemed by us in whole or part at any time on or after March 15, 2009, at certain specified prices. We used $400 million of these proceeds to pay down our term loan B as discussed above. Our senior and senior subordinated notes, as of December 31, 2007, consisted of $900 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments in March and September. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time as described above and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2007, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $968 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.37% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. In addition, we maintain two forward interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $200 million. These forward interest rate swaps will have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rates to fixed rates of 4.05% and 4.70% on our term loan B outstanding debt. These forward interest rate swaps agreements take effect September 30, 2008, require quarterly interest payments beginning in December 2008, and expire in 2010. During 2007, 2006, and 2005 we accrued net cash benefits (obligations) of approximately $14.5 million, $15.8 million, and $(0.3) million, respectively from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. During 2005, we also incurred additional net cash obligations of $1.5 million from these swaps, which is included in swap valuation gains. We estimate that approximately $0.5 million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2007 will be reclassified into income in 2008. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the total fair value of these swaps was a net liability of $0.5 million, and an asset of $29.5 million, respectively. The 2007 amount was primarily included in other long term liabilities and the 2006 amount was primarily included in other long term assets. Also during 2007 and 2006, we recorded $16.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, net of tax, as reductions to other comprehensive income for valuation losses, net of amounts reclassified into income. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 50% of our variable rate debt and approximately 74% of our total debt economically fixed. As a result of the swap agreements, our overall effective weighted average interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 5.90%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, as of December 31, 2007. 47 At December 31, 2007, our overall average effective interest rate was 6.37%. NxStage Agreement On February 7, 2007, we entered into a National Provider Agreement with NxStage, Inc. The agreement provides us the ability to purchase NxStage home based hemodialysis products at a potential discount depending upon the achievement of certain volume targets. The agreement has an initial term of three years, terminating on December 31, 2009, and may be extended in six month increments up to two additional years if certain volume targets are met. As a part of the agreement, we purchased outright all of our NxStage System One equipment then in use for $5.1 million, and will purchase a majority of our future home based hemodialysis equipment and supplies from NxStage. In connection with the provider agreement, we purchased two million shares of NxStage common stock in a private placement offering for $20 million, representing an ownership position of approximately 7%. We subsequently sold our NxStage Inc. shares, in the second and third quarters of 2007 for approximately $25.9 million and recognized a pre tax gain of $5.9 million or $3.6 million after tax. This pre tax gain is included in other income. Stock based compensation and other equity matters Effective January 1, 2006, we implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R) Share Based Payment, which requires the measurement and recognition of cost for all stock based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, and discounted employee stock purchases. Under SFAS No. 123(R) our stock based compensation awards are measured at estimated fair value on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense over their requisite service periods. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes our previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, under which we did not recognize compensation expense for most of our stock options. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 relating to the application of SFAS No. 123(R), and we have applied the provisions of SAB No. 107 in our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We implemented SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. In accordance with this method, our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to fiscal year 2006 have not been restated to reflect this change. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires that tax benefits realized from stock award exercise gains in excess of stock based compensation expense recognized for financial statement purposes be reported on a prospective basis as cash flows from financing activities rather than as operating cash flows. We also elected to use the method available under Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Staff Position FSP No. 123(R) 3 Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards, which provides an alternative method for calculating historical excess tax benefits from the method described in SFAS No. 123(R) for stock based compensation awards. Under SFAS No. 123(R), stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of the stock based award vesting during that period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for 2007 and 2006 includes compensation cost for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of, December 31, 2005 and subsequent stock based awards granted through December 31, 2006 and 2007. Prior to 2006, we recognized the effect of stock unit forfeitures as they occurred, and the effect of transitioning to recognition of expense based on expected forfeitures was insignificant. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in 2007, 2006 and all prior periods. 48 For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we recognized $34.1 million and $26.4 million, respectively, in stock based compensation expense for stock options, stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock units and discounted employee stock plan purchases, which is primarily included in general and administrative expenses in continuing operations. The estimated tax benefits recorded for this stock based compensation in 2007 and 2006 were $12.8 million and $9.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, there was $78.6 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.6 years. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we received $54.7 million and $37.9 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $32.8 million and $40.4 million, respectively, in total actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. On May 29, 2007, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to increase the number of shares of authorized common stock from 195,000,000 to 450,000,000 shares. Our stockholders also approved an amendment and restatement of our Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under that plan by 800,001 shares, and approved an amendment and restatement of our 2002 Equity Compensation Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under that plan by 6,000,000 shares and, among other things, to remove certain available share recycling features, to change the limit on the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be subject to awards granted to any single recipient in any consecutive twenty four month period so that it applies only to awards of stock options and stock appreciation rights, and to provide additional exceptions from the three year minimum vesting period generally applicable to grants of restricted stock units and other full share awards. 2006 capital structure changes. During 2006, we made principal payments totaling $62 million on our term loan A and $338 million on term loan B which included mandatory principal payments of $35 million and $24.5 million respectively. All of the mandatory principal payments were paid in advance of the scheduled payment dates in 2006. As a result of the principal prepayment made in 2006, we wrote off approximately $3.3 million of deferred financing costs, which is included in debt expense. On March 1, 2006, our interest rate margins on our term loan A and term loan B were reduced by 0.25% as a result of achieving certain financial ratios as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. At December 31, 2006, the term loan A interest rate was based on LIBOR plus 1.75% and the term loan B interest rate was based on LIBOR plus 2.00%. The margins were subject to adjustment depending upon changes in our financial ratios and could have ranged from 1.50% to 2.25% for the revolving line of credit and term loan A, and 2.00% to 2.25% for term loan B. As of December 31, 2006, our senior and senior subordinated notes consisted of $500 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. As of December 31, 2006, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1,341 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.88%, on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 2.00%. The swap agreements require quarterly interest payments, bear amortizing notional amounts, and expire in 2008 through 2010. As of December 31, 2006, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 56% of our variable rate debt and approximately 72% of our total debt. 49 As a result of the swap agreements at December 31, 2006, our overall effective weighted average interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 6.61%, based upon the current margins in effect ranging from 1.75% to 2.00%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.76%. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers and for some of our non wholly owned subsidiaries, in the form of put provisions, which are exercisable at the third party owners future discretion. These put provisions, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the equity interest put to us, which approximates fair value. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several other third party owned centers, noncontrolling owned centers and physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2007 (in millions): Less Than1 year 1 3years 3 5years After5 years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 22 $ 152 $ 1,772 $ 1,750 $ 3,696 Interest payments on senior and senior subordinated notes 121 243 243 183 790 Capital lease obligations 1 1 1 4 7 Operating leases 170 288 223 336 1,017 FIN No. 48 tax liabilities 4 9 4 17 $ 318 $ 693 $ 2,243 $ 2,273 $ 5,527 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 41 $ 41 Acquisition of dialysis centers 131 99 54 46 330 Working capital advances to third parties under administrative services agreements 18 18 $ 190 $ 99 $ 54 $ 46 $ 389 Not included above are interest payments related to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2007 bear interest at LIBOR plus current margins of 1.50%. The term loan A and the revolving line of credit are adjustable depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2007, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities had an overall effective weighted average interest rate of 5.90%, including the effects of our swap agreements. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific debt tranches within each term loan, which can range in maturity from one month to twelve months. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of mandatory principal payments and principal prepayments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no principal prepayments on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities during 2008 and no changes in the effective interest rate, approximately $116 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2008. Our Amended Alliance and Product Supply Agreement with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. (the Amended Product Supply Agreement) requires us to purchase a significant majority of certain hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices through 2015. On July 2, 2007, we notified Gambro Renal Products, Inc. that we were electing to be permanently relieved of our purchase obligation under the Amended 50 Product Supply Agreement to purchase dialysis machines (the Affected Products) because the Affected Products remained subject to an FDA import ban after June 30, 2007. Our total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 on products under the Amended Product Supply Agreement were approximately 2% and 4%, respectively, of our total operating costs. The actual amount of purchases in future years under the Amended Product Supply Agreement will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating and capital requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, and Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. Settlements of approximately $11.0 million of existing FASB Interpretation 48 (FIN 48) liabilities are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made. Contingencies The majority of our revenues are from government programs and may be subject to adjustment as a result of: (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; and (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements. In addition, our revenues from commercial payors may be subject to adjustment as a result of potential claims for refunds, as a result of government actions or as a result of other claims by commercial payors. United States Attorney inquiries In February 2007, we received a request for information from the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, for records relating to Epogen&reg;, or EPO, claims submitted to Medicare. In August 2007, we received a subpoena from the OIG seeking similar documents. The requested documents relate to services provided from 2001 to 2004 by a number of our centers. The request and subpoena were sent from the OIGs offices in Houston and Dallas, Texas. We are cooperating with the inquiry and are producing the requested records. We have been in contact with the United States Attorneys Office, or U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Eastern District of Texas, which has stated that this is a civil inquiry related to EPO claims. There appears to be substantial overlap between this issue and the ongoing review of EPO utilization and claims by the U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis described below. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoena will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. On March 4, 2005, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. The subpoena requires production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including documents related to, among other things, pharmaceutical and other services provided to patients, relationships with pharmaceutical companies, and financial relationships with physicians and joint ventures. The subpoena covers the period from December 1, 1996 through the present. In October 2005, we received a follow up request for additional documents related to specific medical director and joint venture arrangements. In February 2006, we received an additional subpoena for documents, including certain patient records relating to the administration and billing of EPO. In May 2007, we received a request for documents related to durable medical equipment (DME) and supply companies owned and operated by us. We are producing documents and providing information to the government. We are also cooperating, and intend to continue to cooperate, with the governments investigation, including by participating in discussions and meetings with the government. The subpoenas have been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in 51 substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as this to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoenas will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. On October 25, 2004, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. The subpoena covers the period from 1996 to present and requires the production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including DaVita Laboratory Services. Gambro Healthcare received a similar subpoena in November 2004. The subpoena also includes specific requests for documents relating to testing for PTH levels and to products relating to vitamin D therapies. The subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena, including Fresenius Medical Group. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoena may continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. Other We have received several notices of claims from commercial payors and other third parties related to historical billing practices and claims against DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare) related to historical Gambro Healthcare billing practices and other matters covered by their settlement agreement with the Department of Justice. At least one commercial payor has filed an arbitration demand against us, as described below, and additional commercial payors have threatened litigation. We intend to defend against these claims vigorously; however, we may not be successful and these claims may lead to litigation and any such litigation may be resolved unfavorably. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted at this time, an adverse result in excess of our established reserves, with respect to one or more of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In December 2007, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the State of New York to resolve certain billing issues that had been the subject of inquiry by the New York Attorney Generals Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, or MFCU. We had received several informal inquiries from representatives of the MFCU regarding billing practices for facilities managed by us in New York. The Settlement Agreement covers numerous dialysis facilities in New York for which we, through our subsidiaries, provide administrative services. We paid approximately $1.5 million in settlement, which included the amount of the overpayments by the New York Medicaid program plus interest; no fines or penalties were assessed. In October 2007, we were contacted by the Attorney Generals Office for the State of Nevada. The Attorney Generals Office informed us that it was conducting a criminal investigation of our operations in Nevada and that the investigation related to the billing of pharmaceuticals, including EPO. On February 8, 2008, the Attorney Generals Office informed us that the criminal investigation has been discontinued. The Attorney Generals Office further advised us that Nevada Medicaid intends to conduct audits of ESRD providers in Nevada, including us, and that such audits will relate to the issues that were the subjects of the criminal investigation. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. On August 28, 2007, Sheet Metal Workers National Health Fund and Glenn Randle filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against us. The complaint also names as 52 defendants Amgen, Inc. and Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. The complaint is styled as a class action and alleges four claims against us, including violations of the federal RICO statute, Californias unfair competition law, Californias false advertising law and for unjust enrichment. The complaints principal allegations against us are that the defendants engaged in a scheme to unlawfully promote the administration of EPO to hemodialysis patients intravenously, as opposed to subcutaneously, and to over utilize EPO. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or the potential range of damages, if any. On August 8, 2005, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against Gambro AB, DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly Gambro Healthcare) and related entities. The plaintiff sought to bring its claims as a class action on behalf of itself and all entities that paid any of the defendants for health care goods and services from on or about January 1991 through at least December 2004. The complaint alleged, among other things, damages resulting from facts and circumstances underlying Gambro Healthcares December 2004 settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States Government. In March 2006, the case was dismissed and the plaintiff was compelled to seek arbitration to resolve the matter. In November 2006, the plaintiff filed a demand for class arbitration against us and DVA Renal Healthcare. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or the potential range of damages, if any. In June 2004, Gambro Healthcare was served with a complaint filed in the Superior Court of California by one of its former employees who worked for its California acute services program. The complaint, which is styled as a class action, alleges, among other things, that DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly Gambro Healthcare) failed to provide overtime wages, defined rest periods and meal periods, or compensation in lieu of such provisions and failed to comply with certain other California labor code requirements. We intend to vigorously defend against this claim. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted, we do not expect that an unfavorable result, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits, including from time to time, contractual disputes and professional and general liability claims, as well as audits and investigations by various government entities, in the ordinary course of business. We believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly variable compensation accruals, purchase accounting valuation estimates and stock based compensation are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize in a reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant 53 uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the more than 1,100 commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 107,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk to be within 1% of total revenue, which can represent as much as 6.0% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments in third party dialysis businesses, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually, and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. 54 Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year, and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties, which went effective January 1, 2007, we assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain and future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. We make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Long lived tangible and intangible assets are subject to our regular ongoing impairment assessments. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based awards to employees and directors in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payments. Under SFAS No. 123(R), stock based compensation is recognized during a period based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of the stock based award vesting during that period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 includes compensation costs for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of December 31, 2005, and stock based awards granted in those years. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk free interest rates. Significant new accounting standards On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements except for the nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are subject to a one year deferral allowed by FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS157 2 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157. This standard establishes a framework for measuring fair value and also requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard applies to assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. On February 12, 2008, FSP FAS157 2 was issued delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 157 until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The implementation of this standard relating to the assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159 Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of SFAS No. 115. This standard allows companies the alternative to measure 55 certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis that are currently not required to be measured at fair value. The standard is also designed to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R) Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations. This standard requires all business combinations to be accounted for under the acquisition method (previously referred to as the purchase method). Under the acquisition method, the acquirer recognizes the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date. Noncontractual contingencies are recognized at the acquisition date at their fair values only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6 Elements of Financial Statements. Transaction costs are excluded from the acquisition accounting and will be expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration included by the acquirer as part of the purchase price must also be measured at fair value at the acquisition date and will be classified as either equity or a liability. This standard also requires a company that obtains control but acquires less than 100% of an acquiree to record 100% of the fair value of the acquiree assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests at the acquisition date. This standard is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently in the process of assessing the expected impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160 Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, which amends Accounting Research Bulletin, No. 51 Consolidated Financial Statements. This standard requires noncontrolling interests to be treated as a separate component of equity, but apart from the parents equity and not as a liability, or an item outside of equity. This will eliminate diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and its noncontrolling interests. This standard also specifies that consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income, and that changes in the parents ownership interest while it retains a controlling financial interest should be accounted for as equity transactions. This standard also expands disclosures in the financial statements to include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the equity attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling owners and a schedule showing the effects of changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary on the equity attributable to the parent. This standard is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently in the process of assessing the expected impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with SFAS Statement No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement attribute on all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in order to be recognized in the financial statements. In making this assessment, a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position and must assume that the tax position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. Once the recognition threshold is met, the tax position is then measured to determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. In addition, the recognition threshold of more likely than not must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of the tax benefit. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. See note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of adopting this interpretation. 56 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2007. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average LIBOR rates plus margins in effect at the end of 2007 including the economic effects of our swap agreements. Term loan A and revolving line of credit interest rate margins are subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio. The margins currently in effect at December 31, 2007 were 1.50%. For our interest rate swap agreements, the table below presents the notional amounts by contract maturity date and the related interest rate terms of the agreements (to pay fixed rates, and to receive LIBOR).

These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.37% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2008 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. In addition, we maintain two forward interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $200 million. These forward interest rate swaps will have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based interest rates to fixed rates of 4.05% and 4.70% on our term loan B outstanding debt. These forward interest rate swaps agreements take effect September 30, 2008, require quarterly interest payments beginning in December 2008, and expire in 2010. During 2007, we accrued net cash benefits of $14.5 million from these swaps which is included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2007, the total fair value of these swaps was a net liability of $0.5 million. During 2007, we recorded $16.0 million, net of tax, as a reduction to other comprehensive income for valuation losses, net of amounts reclassified into income. As of December 31, 2007, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 50% of our variable rate debt and approximately 74% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements, the overall effective weighted average interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 5.90%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50% as of December 31, 2007. Our overall average effective interest rate during 2007 was 6.49% and as of December 31, 2007 was 6.37%. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis 57 points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $5.5 million, $6.8 million, and $3.2 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.
