We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,449 outpatient dialysis centers and 700 hospitals, serving approximately 112,000 patients in 43 states. In 2008, our overall network of dialysis centers increased by 90 centers primarily as a result of opening new centers and acquisitions and the overall number of patients that we serve increased by approximately 5%. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three stakeholders our patients, our business partners, and our teammates represent the major drivers of our long term performance, although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes as measured by DQI have improved over each of the past three years. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. In addition, over the past several years our teammate turnover has remained constant, which we believe has been a major contributor to our clinical performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. Approximately 96% of our 2008 consolidated revenues were derived directly from our dialysis and related lab services business. Approximately 82% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are derived from 37 outpatient hemodialysis services in 1,426 centers that we consolidate which are either wholly owned or majority owned. Other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services. These services collectively accounted for approximately 15% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues, and the remaining 3% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues were from laboratory services. We also generate management fees from performing management and administrative services to certain dialysis centers that represent less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. Our other business operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our patients. These consist primarily of infusion therapy services, oral pharmacy services, vascular access services, disease management services, special needs plans, physicians services and ESRD clinical research programs. These services generated approximately 4% of our consolidated net revenues in 2008. We currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives as we work to develop successful new business operations. However, significant changes in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may impact the economic viability of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes could result in a write off or an impairment of some or all of our investments in these strategic initiatives, or could also result in significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are: the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week, as well as the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services; average dialysis revenue per treatment; and the number of laboratory patient tests The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, which is influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our ability to open and acquire new centers. Our year over year treatment volume growth was 5.9% in 2008. Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, and our billing and collecting operations performance. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are significantly higher than Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment. The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008: Revenues Medicare and Medicare assigned HMO plans 59 % Medicaid 4 % Other government based programs 2 % Total government based programs 65 % Commercial (including hospital dialysis services) 35 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Government payment rates are principally determined by federal Medicare and state Medicaid policy. These payment rates have historically had limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reduction as 38 federal and state governments face increasing budget pressures. Cumulative net increases in Medicare payment rates from 1990 through 2007 totaled approximately 10%, which is less than the impact of inflation over the same period. In July 2008, Congress passed the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act. This act provides for an increase in the composite rate of 1% in 2009 and 2010. In 2011, a new payment system will be established that will provide for a single bundled payment base rate with an initial rate set at 2% below the rate we would have received under the historical methodology. Beginning in 2012, the bundled payment base rate will be adjusted annually for inflation based upon a market basket index, less 1% of such index. Dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with large payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Except for some rate reductions that occurred in late 2007, we have been successful in maintaining relatively stable average payment rates in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic rate increases. However, we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors and payors are increasingly aggressive in their negotiations. If our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, this would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We also expect that some of our contracted rates with commercial payors may decrease or we may experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. In addition, payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations on non contracted or out of network providers, which could further decrease our commercial rate revenues. Approximately 30% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were from physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for approximately 20% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. Therefore, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in private and governmental payment rates for EPO significantly influence our revenue. For example, in July 2007, CMS implemented a new reimbursement methodology for EPO which decreased our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment. In addition, effective January 2008, changes to the EPO monitoring policy went into effect which further limited reimbursements. These changes impacted the prescribing habits of our physicians, which resulted in lower pharmaceutical intensities during 2008, which negatively impacted our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in 2008. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past several years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. In 2008, we made several systems upgrades and process changes and will continue to do so in 2009 as necessary to improve our billing and collection performance. However, as we implement these system upgrades, our collection performance as well as our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment could be negatively impacted. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was approximately $334, $334 and $330 for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. In 2008, our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment decreased slightly, primarily due to the impact of some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, a decrease in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals offset by changes in mix and rates of some of our other commercial payors. In 2007, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment increased primarily due to an increase in realized rates from our commercial payors and an increase in the Medicare composite rate, partially offset by a decrease in the government reimbursement for pharmaceuticals 39 associated with the new CMS reimbursement rates for EPO, and a decrease in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, including the bundling of such services, and changes in the mix of government and commercial payors may materially impact our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in the future. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost changes, such as employee benefit costs and insurance costs. Our average clinical hours per treatment have remained relatively stable over the past few years primarily because of improved efficiencies driven by reduced clinical teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels previously achieved, and changes in federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. As an example, during the third and fourth quarters of 2008 we experienced an increase in our labor hours as we implemented new federal guidelines. In 2008 and 2007, we also experienced an increase in our labor rates of approximately 3.5% and 3.0%, respectively, as labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. For the past several years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors. In addition, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO provides for specific rebates based on a combination of factors, including process improvement and data submission, which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to qualify for these rebates. In 2008, we experienced increases in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new centers opened and centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, as well as general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of consolidated revenues over the past three years. However, this reflects a substantial increase in the dollar amount of spending related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal matters and supporting the growth in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. We expect that the level of general and administrative expenses will be sustained and can vary depending upon the level of investment we make in our long term initiatives, including further investments in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Outlook for 2009. Our operating income guidance for 2009 is projected to be in the range of $820 $880 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks and uncertainties include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates or the structure of payments under the Medicare ESRD program which result in lower reimbursement for services we provide to Medicare patients, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and compliance with the corporate integrity agreement applicable to the dialysis centers acquired from Gambro Healthcare and assumed in connection with such acquisition, and the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the cautionary language contained in the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 37 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. 40 Results of operations We operate principally as a dialysis and related lab services business but also operate other ancillary services and strategic initiatives businesses. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives consist of infusion therapy services, pharmacy services, vascular access services, disease management services and full service special needs plans, physician services, as well as clinical research programs. The dialysis and related lab services business qualifies as a separately reportable segment under SFAS No. 131, and all of the other ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been combined and disclosed in the other segments category. Following is a summary of consolidated operating results for reference in the discussion that follows.

(the Product Supply Agreement) in 2007 and 2006 as well as gains on insurance settlements from Hurricane Katrina in 2007 from non GAAP adjusted consolidated operating income in 2007 and 2006, respectively, because management believes that this presentation enhances a users understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding a non recurring non cash gain that resulted from the termination of our purchase obligation for dialysis machines from Gambro Renal Products Inc. under the Product Supply Agreement as well as an unusual insurance gain, and as a result is both more meaningful and comparable to our current and prior period results, and more indicative of our normal consolidated operating income. Consolidated net operating revenues Consolidated net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $396 million or approximately 7.5% from 2007. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $285 million, principally due to increased treatments, and an increase of approximately $111 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues primarily from growth in our pharmacy, VillageHealth special needs plans and from our infusion therapy business. Consolidated net operating revenues for 2007 increased by approximately $383 million or approximately 7.9% from 2006. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $331 million, principally due to an increase in both treatments and average revenue per treatment, and an increase of approximately $52 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues primarily from growth in our pharmacy and in our VillageHealth demonstration projects as well as from the acquisition of our infusion therapy business. Consolidated operating income Consolidated operating income was $822 million for 2008, as compared to $862 million for 2007. Consolidated operating income in 2007 included a valuation gain of $55 million on the Product Supply Agreement and the $7 million insurance settlement related to Hurricane Katrina. Excluding the valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement and the insurance settlement in 2007, our consolidated operating income for 2008 would have increased by approximately $22 million, compared to the adjusted operating income for 2007. This increase was primarily due to treatment growth in dialysis and related lab services revenues, combined with growth in revenue in ancillary services and strategic initiatives outpacing increases in our operating expenses. Our ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating losses were reduced by approximately $17 million in 42 2008. However, our consolidated operating income for 2008 was negatively affected by rising labor costs, the absence of a Medicare rate increase, the impact of some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, decreases in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, an increase in the operating costs of our dialysis centers, driven in part by the number of new dialysis centers opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, an increase in pharmaceuticals costs (primarily heparin) and an increase in stock based compensation costs. Consolidated operating income was $862 million for 2007, as compared to $739 million for 2006. Consolidated operating income in 2007 and 2006 included valuation gains of $55 million and $38 million, respectively, on the Product Supply Agreement. 2007 also included a $7 million insurance settlement related to Hurricane Katrina. Excluding these items our adjusted consolidated operating income for 2007 would have increased by approximately $99 million compared to our adjusted consolidated operating income for 2006. The increase in adjusted consolidated operating income was primarily due to an increase in both treatment growth and revenue per treatment in the dialysis and related lab services business outpacing slower growth in operating expenses, lower self insurance and benefit costs, as well as reductions in integration expenditures. The increase in adjusted consolidated income in 2007 was primarily the result of increases in operating income in the dialysis and related lab services business, partially offset by higher operating losses in ancillary services and strategic initiatives that increased by approximately $24 million, as we made additional investments in our infrastructure and incurred additional operating expenses and professional fees associated with establishing our VillageHealth special needs plans. Operating segments Dialysis and Related Lab Services Year ended 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 5,415 $ 5,130 $ 4,799 Segment margin $ 943 $ 993 $ 829 Net operating revenues Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $285 million or approximately 5.6% from 2007. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 5.9%, offset by a slight decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment. The increase in number of treatments was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatment days in 2008 and non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. The decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily due to the impact of some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, decreases in intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals partially offset by changes in mix and rates of some of our other commercial payors. Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2007 increased by approximately $331 million or 6.9% from 2006. The increase in net operating revenues in 2007 was principally due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 5.7% and an increase in the average revenue per treatment of approximately 1.2%. The increase in the number of treatments was primarily attributable to non acquired annual treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. Our average dialysis revenue per treatment increased from $330 in 2006 to $334 in 2007. This increase in average dialysis revenue per treatment was due primarily to an increase in realized rates from our commercial payors and an increase in the Medicare composite rate, partially offset by a decrease in the government reimbursement for pharmaceuticals associated with the new CMS reimbursement rates for EPO, and a decrease in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. 43 The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues by source for the year ended December 31, 2008: Revenuepercentages Outpatient hemodialysis centers 82 % Peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis 10 % Hospital inpatient hemodialysis 5 % Laboratory services 3 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % In addition to reimbursements for dialysis treatments, the other major component of dialysis and related lab services revenues is the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents slightly more than 30% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues. Approximately 65% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage Plans, representing approximately 87% of our total patients. Approximately 35% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues and 13% of our patients are associated with commercial payors. Less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services payments are due directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 5% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. On average we are paid significantly more for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans than we are for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other government plans. Patients covered by employer group health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. As of December 31, 2008, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $149 and $165 per treatment, or an overall average of $157 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Our net earnings from dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates and others of which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. We are continuously in negotiations with commercial payors for contracted rates and some of these payment rates are under downward pressure as we negotiate these rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers and we expect this trend to continue into 2009. We also expect that we may experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. If we experience a net overall reduction in our contracted commercial rates as a result of these negotiations, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors, including our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted and non contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, including the bundling of such services and changes in the mix of government and non government payments. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and operating costs of the dialysis centers. The dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $230, $227 and $229 for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The $3 increase in the per treatment costs in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to an increase in labor rates and our labor 44 hours were negatively impacted during the year as we implemented new federal guidelines. Additionally, we experienced an increase in the operating costs of our dialysis centers driven in part by the number of new centers opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, and an increase in pharmaceutical costs (primarily heparin), partially offset by a decrease in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis decreased by approximately $2 in 2007 as compared to 2006. The decrease in the per treatment costs was primarily attributable to decreases in employee benefit costs, reductions in our professional and general liability costs, as well as decreases in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by an increase in labor costs and an increase in the operating costs of our dialysis centers. General and administrative expenses. Dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses for the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006 were approximately $398 million, $397 million and $391 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $1 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to increases in labor costs and the timing of certain other expenditures, mainly offset by lower integration costs and lower professional fees. The increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $6 million in 2007 as compared to 2006, was primarily due to higher labor costs and the timing of certain expenditures, partially offset by lower integration expenditures related to the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition that were completed by the end of 2007 and lower professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives. Depreciation and amortization. Dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for 2008, 2007 and 2006 were approximately $210 million, $189 million and $171 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $21 million in depreciation and amortization for dialysis and related lab services in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to growth through new center developments and expansions and an increase in amortization expense as a result of reductions in the intangible liability associated with the Product Supply Agreement, as discussed below. The increase in depreciation and amortization for 2007 of approximately $18 million, as compared to 2006 was primarily due to growth through new center developments and expansions. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for dialysis and related lab services was 2.6% for all years presented. The current provision level of 2.6% may increase if we encounter problems with our billing and collection process. Product Supply Agreement. We entered into the Alliance and Product Supply Agreement with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. on October 5, 2005, in conjunction with our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. The agreement committed us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices through 2015. The agreement was amended on August 25, 2006 (the Amended Product Supply Agreement) to reduce our purchase obligations for certain hemodialysis product supplies and equipment. As a result of the reductions, we recorded a net valuation gain of $38 million during 2006. This valuation gain represents the difference in the amortized original fair value between the Product Supply Agreement and that of the Amended Product Supply Agreement, as of the effective date of the amendment. In 2007, we terminated our obligation to purchase certain dialysis machines under the Amended Product Supply Agreement. As a result of that termination we recorded a net valuation gain of $55 million in 2007. This valuation gain represents the difference in the amortized original fair value of the Amended Product Supply Agreement and that of the Amended Product Supply Agreement as adjusted for the termination of the obligation to purchase certain dialysis machines as of June 30, 2007. We continue to be subject to the Product Supply Agreements requirements to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis non equipment product supplies, such as dialyzers, from Gambro Renal Products at fixed prices. 45 Operating income Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2008 decreased by approximately $50 million as compared to 2007. Operating income in 2007 included a valuation gain of $55 million on the Product Supply Agreement and $7 million of insurance settlements relating to Hurricane Katrina as discussed above. Excluding these items, operating income for 2008 would have increased by approximately $12 million as compared to adjusted operating income for 2007. The increase in the operating income for 2008 as compared to adjusted operating income for 2007 was primarily due to growth in the volume of revenue outpacing increases in certain expenditures. However, operating income for 2008 was negatively affected by certain significant items such as a decrease in our dialysis revenue per treatment, lower intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, an increase in labor costs and higher operating costs of our dialysis centers primarily associated with the number of new centers that were opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, an increase in pharmaceutical costs (primarily heparin), and the absence of a Medicare rate increase. Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2007 increased by approximately $164 million as compared to 2006. 2007 and 2006 included valuation gains of $55 million and $38 million, respectively, on the product supply agreement. 2007 also included a $7 million insurance settlement as discussed above. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income for 2007 would have increased by approximately $140 million as compared to adjusted operating income for 2006. This large increase was driven primarily by growth in both treatments and revenue per treatment, along with labor productivity improvements, and reductions in certain operating expenditures such as benefit and insurance costs, as well as integration expenditures. Other Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Year ended 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 245 $ 134 $ 82 Segment loss $ (34 ) $ (51 ) $ (27 ) Net operating revenues The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $111 million or 83% as compared to 2007, primarily from growth in our pharmacy business, VillageHealth special needs plans and demonstration projects, our vascular access services business and a full year of operations of HomeChoice Partners, our infusion therapy business, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2007. The increase in net operating revenues in 2007 of approximately $52 million or 64% from 2006 was primarily due to growth in our pharmacy business, the acquisition of HomeChoice Partners, and growth in our VillageHealth demonstration projects. Operating expenses Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2008 increased by approximately $93 million from 2007, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business, an increase in fixed operating expenses, an increase in labor costs and a full year of operations of our infusion therapy services, partially offset by lower professional fees in our VillageHealth business, as described below. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2007 increased by approximately $76 million from 2006, primarily due to the acquisition of HomeChoice Partners, volume growth in our pharmacy business, additional operating expenses and professional fees associated with establishing the VillageHealth special needs plans that became effective in early 2007, and higher labor and benefit costs. 46 Operating loss Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2008 decreased by approximately $17 million from 2007. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to growth in revenues outpacing increases in operating expenses, primarily associated with our pharmacy business and our vascular access services. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2007 increased by approximately $24 million from 2006. The increase in operating losses was primarily related to the cost of establishing the VillageHealth special needs plans. Corporate level charges Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation of approximately $41 million for 2008 increased by approximately $7 million from 2007. Stock based compensation for 2007 increased by approximately $8 million from 2006. The increases in both periods resulted from increases in both the average grant date fair value and aggregate quantity, of grants that contributed expense to each of these years. Minority interests and equity income, net. Minority interests and equity income, net, increased by approximately $1.1 million in 2008, and increased by approximately $9.7 million in 2007. The increases for both years were primarily due to an increase in new dialysis centers having minority partners, growth in the earnings of our existing dialysis joint ventures and an increase in the number of other non wholly owned subsidiaries. Debt expense. Debt expense for 2008, 2007, and 2006 consisted of interest expense of approximately $215 million, $243 million, and $263 million, respectively, amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $10 million for each year presented. 2007 and 2006 also included the write off of approximately $4 million and $3 million, respectively, of deferred financing costs associated with the principal prepayments on our term loans. The decrease in interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Our overall weighted average interest rate in 2008 was 5.82% as compared to 6.49% in 2007. The decrease in interest expense in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to lower average outstanding principal balances during 2007 under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities as a result of principal prepayments, and decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Our overall weighted average interest rate in 2007 was 6.49% as compared to 6.64% in 2006. Other income. Other income was approximately $12 million, $22 million, and $13 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, and consisted principally of interest income. The decrease in other income in 2008 was primarily due to the fact that 2007 other income included gains on the sale of investments of approximately $6 million resulting from the sale of our NxStage shares as discussed below and a decrease in interest rates as well as lower average cash and investment balances. Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for 2008 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 38.6%, compared with 39.2% and 39.2% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2008 was primarily due to nonrecurring tax benefits associated with transactions occurring in 2008. We currently project the effective income tax rate for 2009 to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses, and our investments in ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. These types of adjustments are charged directly to the corresponding operating segment that incurred the charge. 47 Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2008 and 2007 represented approximately 70 and 66 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt provision. The relative increase in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2008 was a result of growth and slower cash collections. In 2007, we experienced high cash collections, which significantly decreased the number of days of net revenue in our account receivable balances. Accounts receivable balances of 70 days of revenue is more consistent with our past and expected trends. As of December 31, 2008 approximately $102 million in unreserved accounts receivable, representing approximately 9% of our total accounts receivable balance, were more than six months old. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than 1% of our treatments are classified as patient pay. Substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, other than the standard monthly processing, consisted of approximately $39 million and $31 million, respectively, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Currently, our Medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. However, the payment received from Medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. Such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements, except for potentially limiting the collectibility of these Medicare bad debt claims. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2008, our cash balance was $411 million and we had undrawn credit under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $250 million, of which approximately $51 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2008 amounted to $556 million, compared with $533 million for 2007. Cash flow from operations in 2008 included cash interest payments of approximately $223 million and cash tax payments of $163 million. Cash flow from operations in 2007 included cash interest payments of $245 million and cash tax payments of $206 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2008 included $318 million for capital asset expenditures, including $213 million for new center developments and relocations, and $105 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $126 million for acquisitions. During 2008, we also received $43 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition we received $48 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also repurchased 4.8 million shares of our common stock for approximately $233 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2007 included $272 million for capital asset expenditures, including $162 million for new center developments and relocations and $110 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $127 million for acquisitions. During 2007, we also received $37 million from the maturity and sale of investments as well as an additional $88 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and related excess tax benefits. We also repurchased 0.1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $6 million. During 2008, we acquired a total of 20 dialysis centers, opened 87 new dialysis centers, sold or closed nine centers, merged eight centers into other existing centers, ceased operations at one joint venture in which we owned a noncontrolling interest and added a net one center under management and administrative service agreements. During 2007, we acquired a total of 16 dialysis centers, opened 64 new dialysis centers, sold or closed six centers and discontinued providing management and administrative services to 21 centers. We also acquired a 50% noncontrolling ownership interest in a joint venture that operated six dialysis centers. 48 We currently expect to spend approximately $100 million for general maintenance capital asset expenditures in 2009, and approximately $250 million for new center development, relocations and center acquisitions depending upon the availability of certain projects and sufficient project returns. We expect to generate approximately $500 million to $550 million of operating cash flow in 2009. Our actual expenditures for growth and cash flows in 2009 could vary significantly from these expected amounts. 2008 capital structure changes and other items Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain customary affirmative and negative covenants and require compliance with financial covenants, including an interest rate coverage ratio and a leverage ratio that determines the interest rate margins on our term loan A and our revolving line of credit. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities in general also contain limits on the general amount of capital expenditures for internal growth, acquisitions and capital improvements, as described below, as well as limits on the amount of tangible net assets in non guarantor subsidiaries. Term Loan A During 2008, we made mandatory principal payments totaling $14.9 million on the term loan A. As a result of these principal payments, the outstanding balance on our term loan A as of December 31, 2008 was $214.4 million and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall weighted average effective rate of 1.97%. The interest rate margin is subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term loan A matures in October 2011 and requires annual principal payments of $61.3 million in 2009, $87.5 million in 2010 and $65.6 million in 2011, respectively. Term Loan B As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance of our term loan B was $1.7 billion and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% for an overall weighted average effective rate of 3.63%, including the impact of our swap agreements. We did not make any principal payments on the term loan B during 2008, nor were we required to. Term loan B matures in October 2012 and requires principal payments of $1.7 billion in year 2012. Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes Our senior and senior subordinated notes, as of December 31, 2008, consisted of $900 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments in March and September. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2008, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $790 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.54% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2009 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2008, 2007, and 2006 we accrued net cash (obligations) benefits of approximately ($4.2) million, $14.5 million, and $15.8 million, respectively, from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. We estimate that approximately $14.3 million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2008 will be reclassified into income in 2009. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the total fair value of these swaps was a liability of $21.9 million and a net 49 liability of $0.5 million, respectively. The 2008 and 2007 amounts were primarily included in other long term liabilities. Also during 2008 and 2007, we recorded approximately $10.4 million and $16.0 million, respectively, net of tax, as reductions to other comprehensive income for swap valuation losses, net of amounts reclassified into income. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 41% of our variable rate debt and approximately 69% of our total debt was economically fixed. As a result of the swap agreements, our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 3.48%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, our overall average effective interest rate was 5.10%. Stock repurchases During 2008, we repurchased a total of 4,788,881 shares of our common stock for $232.7 million, or an average price of $48.59 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. On May 1, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of an additional $143.5 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2008 was $153.5 million. This stock repurchase program has no expiration date. Stock based compensation Under SFAS No. 123(R), stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of the stock based award vesting during that period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 includes compensation cost for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of, December 31, 2005 and stock based awards granted thereafter. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in all prior periods. During 2008, we granted 4,563,350 stock settled stock appreciation rights with a grant date fair value of $50.2 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 3.35 years, and also granted 37,819 stock units with a grant date fair value of $1.9 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 1.1 years. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we recognized $41.2 million and $34.1 million, respectively, in stock based compensation expense for stock options, stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock units and discounted employee stock plan purchases, which is primarily included in general and administrative expenses. The estimated tax benefits recorded for this stock based compensation in 2008 and 2007 were $15.6 million and $12.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, there was $79.6 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we received $35.6 million and $54.7 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $14.0 million and $32.8 million, respectively, in total actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. Developments in 2008 In July 2008, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act for 2008 was passed by Congress. This legislation provides for an increase in the composite rate of 1% in 2009 and in 2010. In addition this 50 legislation introduces a new payment system for dialysis services beginning in January 2011 whereby ESRD payments will be made under a bundled payment rate which will provide for a fixed rate for all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment, including laboratory services and the administration of pharmaceuticals. The initial 2011 bundled rate will be set 2% below the payment rate that providers would have received under the historical fee for service payment methodology. Beginning in 2012, a new single bundled payment base rate will be adjusted annually for inflation based upon a market basket index, less 1% of such index. The bundled payment rate will be determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who will have discretion to determine the base payment rate based on the goods and services included in the bundled rate. Dialysis providers will have the option to move fully to the bundled payment system in 2011 or to phase in the payment system over three years. In February 2008, Baxter Healthcare Corporation proceeded with a recall of heparin, a pharmaceutical used in the treatment of dialysis patients, and ceased further sales. As a result of the recall, there is only one remaining supplier of heparin and the cost to purchase heparin has significantly increased. It is possible that our heparin costs may continue to increase and since there is no separate reimbursement for this drug under Medicare, cost increases have a direct impact on our profitability. An affiliate of Fresenius Medical Care acquired the sole remaining provider of heparin for the U.S. dialysis market. This could negatively impact our access to and pricing for this critical product. 2007 capital structure changes and other capital items During 2007, we made principal payments totaling $50 million on term loan A and $400 million on term loan B. The term loan B payment was made from the proceeds of new senior notes as discussed below. These principal payments were prepayments. As a result of the principal prepayments made in 2007 we wrote off a total of $4.4 million of deferred financing costs, which is included in debt expense. Term Loan A On February 27, 2007, our interest rate margin on term loan A was reduced by 0.25% as a result of our achieving certain financial ratios as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. At December 31, 2007, our term loan A bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall effective rate of 6.35%. The interest rate margin is subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term Loan B On February 23, 2007, we amended and restated our existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities to, among other things, reduce the interest rate margin on term loan B by 0.50%, and to amend certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2007, the amended term loan B bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall effective rate of 5.80%, including the impact of our swap agreements, except for the forward interest rate swap agreements. Other terms that were changed included the amount by which we can elect to increase the revolving and term loan commitments from $500 million to $750 million and certain limitations on purchases, redemptions or acquisitions of capital stock, the payment of dividends and distributions in cash. Further, limitations on capital expenditures for internal growth will not apply during the periods in which our leverage ratio is less than 3.5:1. We incurred financing costs of $1.8 million which were deferred and also expensed $0.2 million of other costs in connection with this transaction. Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes On February 23, 2007, we issued $400 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 in a private offering, realizing $405 million in proceeds, which included a $5 million premium, and incurred $2.7 million in related deferred financing costs. These senior notes are part of the same series of debt securities as the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% senior notes that were issued in March 2005. Our effective interest rate for 51 the $400 million of 6 5/8% senior notes is 6.45%. The senior notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments which began March 15, 2007. The senior notes may be redeemed by us in whole or part at any time on or after March 15, 2009, at certain specified prices. We used $400 million of these proceeds to pay down our term loan B as discussed above. NxStage agreement In February 2007 we entered into a National Provider Agreement with NxStage, Inc. As a part of the agreement, we purchased outright all of our NxStage System One equipment then in use for $5.1 million, and have been purchasing a majority of our home based hemodialysis equipment and supplies from NxStage. In connection with the provider agreement, we purchased two million shares of NxStage common stock in a private placement offering for $20 million, representing an ownership position of approximately 7%. We subsequently sold our NxStage Inc. shares in the second and third quarters of 2007 for approximately $25.9 million and recognized a pre tax gain of $5.9 million or $3.6 million after tax. This pre tax gain is included in other income. Other stockholder items On May 29, 2007, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to increase the number of shares of authorized common stock from 195,000,000 to 450,000,000 shares. Our stockholders also approved an amendment and restatement of our Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under that plan by 800,001 shares, and approved an amendment and restatement of our 2002 Equity Compensation Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under that plan by 6,000,000 shares and, among other things, to remove certain available share recycling features, to change the limit on the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be subject to awards granted to any single recipient in any consecutive twenty four month period so that it applies only to awards of stock options and stock appreciation rights, and to provide additional exceptions from the three year minimum vesting period generally applicable to grants of restricted stock units and other full share awards. Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2007, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $968 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.37%, on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2009 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. In addition, we also maintained two forward interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $200 million that went effective on September 30, 2008. As of December 31, 2007, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 50% of our variable rate debt and approximately 74% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements, at December 31, 2007 our overall weighted average effective interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 5.90%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.37%. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We also have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers and for 52 some of our non wholly owned subsidiaries in the form of put provisions, which are exercisable at the third party owners future discretion within specified periods as outlined in each specific put provision. These put provisions, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the equity interest put to us, which is intended to approximate fair value. We have estimated the fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions based upon either a predetermined multiple of earnings, or the higher of a liquidation value or an average multiple of earnings determined by historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. The estimate of the fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions is a critical accounting estimate that involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which these obligations may ultimately be settled in the future, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the credit and capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners interests. For additional information, see Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements. We also have potential cash commitments to provide working capital advances as needed to several other dialysis centers in which we either own a noncontrolling interest, or which are wholly owned by third parties, as well as to physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under management and administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2008 (in millions): Less Than1 year 1 3years 3 5years After5 years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 72 $ 156 $ 2,607 $ 850 $ 3,685 Interest payments on senior and senior subordinated notes 121 243 213 92 669 Capital lease obligations 1 1 1 3 6 Operating leases 194 333 257 393 1,177 $ 388 $ 733 $ 3,078 $ 1,338 $ 5,537 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 51 $ $ $ $ 51 Acquisition of dialysis centers under put provisions 127 64 61 39 291 Pay fixed swaps potential obligations 14 8 22 Working capital advances 16 16 $ 208 $ 72 $ 61 $ 39 $ 380 Not included above are interest payments related to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2008 bear interest at LIBOR plus current margins of 1.50%. The term loan A and the revolving line of credit are adjustable depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2008, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities had an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 3.48%, including the effects of our swap agreements. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific debt tranches within each term loan, which can range in maturity from one month to twelve months. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of mandatory principal payments and principal prepayments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no principal prepayments on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities during 2009 and no changes in the effective interest rate, approximately $67 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2009. 53 In addition to the above commitments, we are obligated to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products and supplies at fixed prices through 2015 from Gambro Renal Products, Inc. in connection with the Product Supply Agreement. Our total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs in each year. The actual amount of purchases in future years under the Product Supply Agreement will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, and Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. The pay fixed swap obligations represent the estimated fair market values of our interest rate swap agreements as reported by various broker dealers that are based upon relevant observable market inputs as well as other current market conditions that existed as of December 31, 2008, and represent the estimated potential obligation that we would be required to pay based upon future settlement of each specific tranche within the swap agreements. The actual amount of our obligation associated with these swaps in the future will depend upon changes in interest rates that can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions, and other relevant factors that can affect the fair market value of these swap agreements. Settlements of approximately $12.0 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made. Contingencies The majority of our revenues are from government programs and may be subject to adjustment as a result of: (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; and (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements. In addition, our revenues from commercial payors may be subject to adjustment as a result of potential claims for refunds, as a result of government actions or as a result of other claims by commercial payors. Inquiries by the Federal Government In December 2008, we received a subpoena for documents from the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, relating to the pharmaceutical products Zemplar, Hectorol, Venofer, Ferrlicit and Epogen&reg;, or EPO, as well as other related matters. The subpoena covers the period from January 2003 to the present. We have been in contact with the United States Attorneys Office, or U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Northern District of Georgia and the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, DC, since November 2008 relating to this matter, and have been advised that this is a civil inquiry. We are cooperating with the inquiry and are producing the requested records. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated, or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoena will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In February 2007, we received a request for information from the OIG for records relating to EPO claims submitted to Medicare. In August 2007, we received a subpoena from the OIG seeking similar documents. The requested documents relate to services provided from 2001 to 2004 by a number of our centers. The request and subpoena were sent from the OIGs offices in Houston and Dallas, Texas. We are cooperating with the inquiry and are producing the requested records. We have been in contact with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Texas, which has stated that this is a civil inquiry related to EPO claims. There appears to be substantial overlap between this issue and the ongoing review of EPO utilization and claims by the U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis described below. To our knowledge, no 54 proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to these inquiries will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In March 2005, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. The subpoena requires production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including documents related to, among other things, pharmaceutical and other services provided to patients, relationships with pharmaceutical companies, and financial relationships with physicians and joint ventures. The subpoena covers the period from December 1, 1996 through the present. In October 2005, we received a follow up request for additional documents related to specific medical director and joint venture arrangements. In February 2006, we received an additional subpoena for documents, including certain patient records relating to the administration and billing of EPO. In May 2007, we received a request for documents related to durable medical equipment and supply companies owned and operated by us. We are cooperating with the inquiry and are producing the requested records. The subpoenas have been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as this to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoenas will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. In October 2004, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. The subpoena covers the period from 1996 to present and requires the production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including DaVita Laboratory Services. Gambro Healthcare received a similar subpoena in November 2004. The subpoena also includes specific requests for documents relating to testing for parathyroid hormone levels, or PTH, and to products relating to vitamin D therapies. The subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena, including Fresenius Medical Group. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoena will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. Other We have received several notices of claims from commercial payors and other third parties related to historical billing practices and claims against DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare) related to historical Gambro Healthcare billing practices and other matters covered by their 2004 settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the U.S. government. At least one commercial payor has filed an arbitration demand against us, as described below, and additional commercial payors have threatened litigation. We intend to defend against these claims vigorously; however, we may not be successful and these claims may lead to litigation and any such litigation may be resolved unfavorably. Several wage and hour claims have been filed against us in the Superior Court of California, each of which has been styled as a class action. In February 2007, June 2008, October 2008 and December 2008, we were served with separate complaints by various former employees, each of which alleges, among other things, that we failed to provide rest and meal periods, failed to pay compensation in lieu of providing such rest or meal periods, 55 and failed to comply with certain other California labor code requirements. In October 2008, we were served with a complaint which alleges, among other things, that we failed to pay the rate on the wage statement, and failed to comply with other California labor code requirements. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of these matters as class actions. In October 2007, we were contacted by the Attorney Generals Office for the State of Nevada. The Attorney Generals Office informed us that it was conducting a civil and criminal investigation of our operations in Nevada and that the investigation related to the billing of pharmaceuticals, including EPO. In February 2008, the Attorney Generals Office informed us that the civil and criminal investigation has been discontinued. The Attorney Generals Office further advised us that Nevada Medicaid intends to conduct audits of ESRD providers in Nevada, including us, and that such audits will relate to the issues that were the subjects of the investigation. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. In August 2007, Sheet Metal Workers National Health Fund and Glenn Randle filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against us. The complaint also names as defendants Amgen Inc. and Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. The complaint is styled as a class action and alleges four claims against us, including violations of the federal RICO statute, Californias unfair competition law, Californias false advertising law and for unjust enrichment. The complaints principal allegations against us are that the defendants engaged in a scheme to unlawfully promote the administration of EPO to hemodialysis patients intravenously, as opposed to subcutaneously, and to over utilize EPO. On December 17, 2008, the Court dismissed the complaint and allegations in their entirety with permission of plaintiffs to amend the complaint. We were not named as a defendant in plaintiffs amended complaint. As a result, we are no longer a defendant in this action. In August 2005, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against Gambro AB, DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare) and related entities. The plaintiff sought to bring its claims as a class action on behalf of itself and all entities that paid any of the defendants for health care goods and services from on or about January 1991 through at least December 2004. The complaint alleged, among other things, damages resulting from facts and circumstances underlying Gambro Healthcares December 2004 settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States Government. In March 2006, the case was dismissed and the plaintiff was compelled to seek arbitration to resolve the matter. In November 2006, the plaintiff filed a demand for class arbitration against us and DVA Renal Healthcare. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or the potential range of damages, if any. In June 2004, Gambro Healthcare was served with a complaint filed in the Superior Court of California by one of its former employees who worked for its California acute services program. The complaint, which is styled as a class action, alleges, among other things, that DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare) failed to provide overtime wages, defined rest periods and meal periods, or compensation in lieu of such provisions and failed to comply with certain other California labor code requirements. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or the potential range of damages, if any. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits, including from time to time, contractual disputes and professional and general liability claims, as well as audits and investigations by various government entities, in the ordinary course of business. We believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 56 Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly variable compensation accruals, purchase accounting valuation estimates, fair value estimates and stock based compensation are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, slow down in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 112,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as 6% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. 57 Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairments of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments in third party dialysis businesses, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers or other operations. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year, and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties, which went effective January 1, 2007, we assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain and future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. We make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets, liabilities and contractual as well as non contractual contingencies associated with our acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Long lived tangible and intangible assets are subject to our regular ongoing impairment assessments. Fair value estimates. We measure the fair value of certain assets, liabilities and commitments in accordance with SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements. Under SFAS No. 157, fair value is defined and is measured based upon certain valuation techniques that include inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets, liabilities and commitments. We have measured the fair values of our applicable assets, liabilities and commitments based upon certain market inputs and assumptions that are either observable or unobservable in determining fair values and have also classified these assets, liabilities and commitments into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels as defined in SFAS No. 157. The fair value of our investments held for sale are based upon quoted market prices and the fair value of our swap agreements are based upon valuation models and a variety of techniques as reported by various broker dealers that are based upon relevant observable market inputs such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, and other credit and liquidity market 58 conditions. For our put provisions we have estimated the fair values of the interests subject to these commitments based upon either a predetermined multiple of earnings, or the higher of a liquidation value or an average multiple of earnings determined by historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. The estimate of the fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which these obligations may ultimately be settled in the future, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the credit and capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners interests. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based awards to employees and directors in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payments. Under SFAS No. 123(R), stock based compensation is recognized during a period based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of the stock based award vesting during that period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 include compensation costs for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of December 31, 2005, and stock based awards granted thereafter. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk free interest rates. Significant new accounting standards On January 1, 2009 we adopted SFAS No. 141(R) Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations. This standard requires all business combinations to be accounted for under the acquisition method (previously referred to as the purchase method). Under the acquisition method, the acquirer recognizes the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date. Noncontractual contingencies are recognized at the acquisition date at their fair values only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6 Elements of Financial Statements. Transaction costs are excluded from the acquisition cost and will be expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration included by the acquirer as part of the purchase price must also be measured at fair value at the acquisition date and will be classified as either equity or a liability. This standard also requires a company that obtains control but acquires less than 100% of an acquiree to record 100% of the fair value of the acquiree assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests at the acquisition date. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2009 we adopted SFAS No. 160 Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, which amends Accounting Research Bulletin, No. 51 Consolidated Financial Statements. This standard requires noncontrolling interests to be treated as a separate component of equity, but apart from the parents equity, and not as a liability or other item outside of equity. This standard also specifies that consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income, and that changes in the parents ownership interest while it retains a controlling financial interest should be accounted for as equity transactions. This standard also expands disclosures in the financial statements to include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the equity attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling owners and a schedule showing the effects of changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary on the equity attributable to the parent. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements; however, it will change the presentation of minority interests in our consolidated financial statements. Although, we are still in process of determining the appropriate classification and measurement of minority interests according to SEC Topic No. 98 Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities. 59 On January 1, 2009 we adopted SFAS No. 161 Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This standard requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities. Entities will be required to provide additional disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This standard encourages but does not require comparative disclosures for earlier periods at the initial adoption. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements except for the nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are subject to a one year deferral allowed by FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS157 2 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157. This standard establishes a framework for measuring fair value and also requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard applies to assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. On January 1, 2009 we adopted certain provisions of SFAS No 157 relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). See note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of adopting this standard. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159 Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of SFAS No. 115. This standard allows companies the alternative to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis that are currently not required to be measured at fair value. The standard is also designed to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with SFAS Statement No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement attribute on all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in order to be recognized in the financial statements. In making this assessment, a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position and must assume that the tax position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. Once the recognition threshold is met, the tax position is then measured to determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. In addition, the recognition threshold of more likely than not must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of the tax benefit. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. See note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of adopting this interpretation. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2008. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average LIBOR rates in effect for all debt tranches plus margins in effect at the end of 2008 including the 60 economic effects of our swap agreements. Term loan A and revolving line of credit interest rate margins are subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio. The margins currently in effect at December 31, 2008 were 1.50%. For our interest rate swap agreements, the table below presents the notional amounts by contract maturity date and the related interest rate terms of the agreements (to pay fixed rates, and to receive LIBOR). Expected maturity date Total FairValue Averageinterestrate 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 3 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 $ 901 $ 853 $ 1,760 $ 1,668 6.88 % Variable rate $ 69 $ 89 $ 66 $ 1,706 $ 1 $ $ 1,931 $ 1,701 3.48 % Notionalamount Contract maturity date Pay fixed Receivevariable Fairvalue 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 (dollars in millions) Swaps: Pay fixed swaps $ 790 $ 401 $ 389 $ $ $ 3.08% to 4.70% LIBOR $ (21.9 ) Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which include the term loan A and the term loan B, consist of various individual tranches that can range in maturity from one month to twelve months and each specific tranche bears interest at a LIBOR rate that is determined by the maturity of that specific tranche. LIBOR based interest rates are reset as each specific tranche matures and can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions including the credit and capital markets. Any increase in the LIBOR based interest rates on the unhedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which totaled approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2008 will have a negative impact on our overall earnings. As of December 31, 2008, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $790 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.54% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2009 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2008, we accrued net cash obligations of $4.2 million from these swaps which is included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2008, the total fair value of these swaps was a liability of $21.9 million. During 2008, we recorded $10.4 million, net of tax, as a reduction to other comprehensive income for swap valuation losses, net of amounts reclassified into income. As of December 31, 2008, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 41% of our variable rate debt and approximately 69% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements, the overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 3.48%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50% as of December 31, 2008. Our overall average effective interest rate during 2008 was 5.82%. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $7.1 million, $5.5 million, and $6.8 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. 61 Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk.

We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,449 outpatient dialysis centers and 700 hospitals, serving approximately 112,000 patients in 43 states. In 2008, our overall network of dialysis centers increased by 90 centers primarily as a result of opening new centers and acquisitions and the overall number of patients that we serve increased by approximately 5%. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three stakeholders our patients, our business partners, and our teammates represent the major drivers of our long term performance, although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes as measured by DQI have improved over each of the past three years. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. In addition, over the past several years our teammate turnover has remained constant, which we believe has been a major contributor to our clinical performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. Approximately 96% of our 2008 consolidated revenues were derived directly from our dialysis and related lab services business. Approximately 82% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are derived from 37 outpatient hemodialysis services in 1,426 centers that we consolidate which are either wholly owned or majority owned. Other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services. These services collectively accounted for approximately 15% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues, and the remaining 3% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues were from laboratory services. We also generate management fees from performing management and administrative services to certain dialysis centers that represent less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. Our other business operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our patients. These consist primarily of infusion therapy services, oral pharmacy services, vascular access services, disease management services, special needs plans, physicians services and ESRD clinical research programs. These services generated approximately 4% of our consolidated net revenues in 2008. We currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives as we work to develop successful new business operations. However, significant changes in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may impact the economic viability of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes could result in a write off or an impairment of some or all of our investments in these strategic initiatives, or could also result in significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are: the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week, as well as the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services; average dialysis revenue per treatment; and the number of laboratory patient tests The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, which is influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our ability to open and acquire new centers. Our year over year treatment volume growth was 5.9% in 2008. Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, and our billing and collecting operations performance. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are significantly higher than Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment. The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008: Revenues Medicare and Medicare assigned HMO plans 59 % Medicaid 4 % Other government based programs 2 % Total government based programs 65 % Commercial (including hospital dialysis services) 35 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Government payment rates are principally determined by federal Medicare and state Medicaid policy. These payment rates have historically had limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reduction as 38 federal and state governments face increasing budget pressures. Cumulative net increases in Medicare payment rates from 1990 through 2007 totaled approximately 10%, which is less than the impact of inflation over the same period. In July 2008, Congress passed the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act. This act provides for an increase in the composite rate of 1% in 2009 and 2010. In 2011, a new payment system will be established that will provide for a single bundled payment base rate with an initial rate set at 2% below the rate we would have received under the historical methodology. Beginning in 2012, the bundled payment base rate will be adjusted annually for inflation based upon a market basket index, less 1% of such index. Dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with large payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Except for some rate reductions that occurred in late 2007, we have been successful in maintaining relatively stable average payment rates in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic rate increases. However, we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors and payors are increasingly aggressive in their negotiations. If our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, this would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We also expect that some of our contracted rates with commercial payors may decrease or we may experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. In addition, payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations on non contracted or out of network providers, which could further decrease our commercial rate revenues. Approximately 30% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were from physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for approximately 20% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. Therefore, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in private and governmental payment rates for EPO significantly influence our revenue. For example, in July 2007, CMS implemented a new reimbursement methodology for EPO which decreased our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment. In addition, effective January 2008, changes to the EPO monitoring policy went into effect which further limited reimbursements. These changes impacted the prescribing habits of our physicians, which resulted in lower pharmaceutical intensities during 2008, which negatively impacted our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in 2008. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past several years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. In 2008, we made several systems upgrades and process changes and will continue to do so in 2009 as necessary to improve our billing and collection performance. However, as we implement these system upgrades, our collection performance as well as our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment could be negatively impacted. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was approximately $334, $334 and $330 for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. In 2008, our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment decreased slightly, primarily due to the impact of some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, a decrease in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals offset by changes in mix and rates of some of our other commercial payors. In 2007, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment increased primarily due to an increase in realized rates from our commercial payors and an increase in the Medicare composite rate, partially offset by a decrease in the government reimbursement for pharmaceuticals 39 associated with the new CMS reimbursement rates for EPO, and a decrease in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, including the bundling of such services, and changes in the mix of government and commercial payors may materially impact our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in the future. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost changes, such as employee benefit costs and insurance costs. Our average clinical hours per treatment have remained relatively stable over the past few years primarily because of improved efficiencies driven by reduced clinical teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels previously achieved, and changes in federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. As an example, during the third and fourth quarters of 2008 we experienced an increase in our labor hours as we implemented new federal guidelines. In 2008 and 2007, we also experienced an increase in our labor rates of approximately 3.5% and 3.0%, respectively, as labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. For the past several years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors. In addition, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO provides for specific rebates based on a combination of factors, including process improvement and data submission, which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to qualify for these rebates. In 2008, we experienced increases in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new centers opened and centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, as well as general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of consolidated revenues over the past three years. However, this reflects a substantial increase in the dollar amount of spending related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal matters and supporting the growth in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. We expect that the level of general and administrative expenses will be sustained and can vary depending upon the level of investment we make in our long term initiatives, including further investments in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Outlook for 2009. Our operating income guidance for 2009 is projected to be in the range of $820 $880 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks and uncertainties include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates or the structure of payments under the Medicare ESRD program which result in lower reimbursement for services we provide to Medicare patients, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and compliance with the corporate integrity agreement applicable to the dialysis centers acquired from Gambro Healthcare and assumed in connection with such acquisition, and the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the cautionary language contained in the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 37 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. 40 Results of operations We operate principally as a dialysis and related lab services business but also operate other ancillary services and strategic initiatives businesses. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives consist of infusion therapy services, pharmacy services, vascular access services, disease management services and full service special needs plans, physician services, as well as clinical research programs. The dialysis and related lab services business qualifies as a separately reportable segment under SFAS No. 131, and all of the other ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been combined and disclosed in the other segments category. Following is a summary of consolidated operating results for reference in the discussion that follows.

(the Product Supply Agreement) in 2007 and 2006 as well as gains on insurance settlements from Hurricane Katrina in 2007 from non GAAP adjusted consolidated operating income in 2007 and 2006, respectively, because management believes that this presentation enhances a users understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding a non recurring non cash gain that resulted from the termination of our purchase obligation for dialysis machines from Gambro Renal Products Inc. under the Product Supply Agreement as well as an unusual insurance gain, and as a result is both more meaningful and comparable to our current and prior period results, and more indicative of our normal consolidated operating income. Consolidated net operating revenues Consolidated net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $396 million or approximately 7.5% from 2007. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $285 million, principally due to increased treatments, and an increase of approximately $111 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues primarily from growth in our pharmacy, VillageHealth special needs plans and from our infusion therapy business. Consolidated net operating revenues for 2007 increased by approximately $383 million or approximately 7.9% from 2006. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $331 million, principally due to an increase in both treatments and average revenue per treatment, and an increase of approximately $52 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues primarily from growth in our pharmacy and in our VillageHealth demonstration projects as well as from the acquisition of our infusion therapy business. Consolidated operating income Consolidated operating income was $822 million for 2008, as compared to $862 million for 2007. Consolidated operating income in 2007 included a valuation gain of $55 million on the Product Supply Agreement and the $7 million insurance settlement related to Hurricane Katrina. Excluding the valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement and the insurance settlement in 2007, our consolidated operating income for 2008 would have increased by approximately $22 million, compared to the adjusted operating income for 2007. This increase was primarily due to treatment growth in dialysis and related lab services revenues, combined with growth in revenue in ancillary services and strategic initiatives outpacing increases in our operating expenses. Our ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating losses were reduced by approximately $17 million in 42 2008. However, our consolidated operating income for 2008 was negatively affected by rising labor costs, the absence of a Medicare rate increase, the impact of some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, decreases in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, an increase in the operating costs of our dialysis centers, driven in part by the number of new dialysis centers opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, an increase in pharmaceuticals costs (primarily heparin) and an increase in stock based compensation costs. Consolidated operating income was $862 million for 2007, as compared to $739 million for 2006. Consolidated operating income in 2007 and 2006 included valuation gains of $55 million and $38 million, respectively, on the Product Supply Agreement. 2007 also included a $7 million insurance settlement related to Hurricane Katrina. Excluding these items our adjusted consolidated operating income for 2007 would have increased by approximately $99 million compared to our adjusted consolidated operating income for 2006. The increase in adjusted consolidated operating income was primarily due to an increase in both treatment growth and revenue per treatment in the dialysis and related lab services business outpacing slower growth in operating expenses, lower self insurance and benefit costs, as well as reductions in integration expenditures. The increase in adjusted consolidated income in 2007 was primarily the result of increases in operating income in the dialysis and related lab services business, partially offset by higher operating losses in ancillary services and strategic initiatives that increased by approximately $24 million, as we made additional investments in our infrastructure and incurred additional operating expenses and professional fees associated with establishing our VillageHealth special needs plans.

The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 5.9%, offset by a slight decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment. The increase in number of treatments was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatment days in 2008 and non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. The decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily due to the impact of some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, decreases in intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals partially offset by changes in mix and rates of some of our other commercial payors. Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2007 increased by approximately $331 million or 6.9% from 2006. The increase in net operating revenues in 2007 was principally due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 5.7% and an increase in the average revenue per treatment of approximately 1.2%. The increase in the number of treatments was primarily attributable to non acquired annual treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. Our average dialysis revenue per treatment increased from $330 in 2006 to $334 in 2007. This increase in average dialysis revenue per treatment was due primarily to an increase in realized rates from our commercial payors and an increase in the Medicare composite rate, partially offset by a decrease in the government reimbursement for pharmaceuticals associated with the new CMS reimbursement rates for EPO, and a decrease in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. 43 The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues by source for the year ended December 31, 2008: Revenuepercentages Outpatient hemodialysis centers 82 % Peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis 10 % Hospital inpatient hemodialysis 5 % Laboratory services 3 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % In addition to reimbursements for dialysis treatments, the other major component of dialysis and related lab services revenues is the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents slightly more than 30% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues. Approximately 65% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage Plans, representing approximately 87% of our total patients. Approximately 35% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues and 13% of our patients are associated with commercial payors. Less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services payments are due directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 5% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. On average we are paid significantly more for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans than we are for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other government plans. Patients covered by employer group health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. As of December 31, 2008, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $149 and $165 per treatment, or an overall average of $157 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Our net earnings from dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates and others of which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. We are continuously in negotiations with commercial payors for contracted rates and some of these payment rates are under downward pressure as we negotiate these rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers and we expect this trend to continue into 2009. We also expect that we may experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. If we experience a net overall reduction in our contracted commercial rates as a result of these negotiations, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors, including our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted and non contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, including the bundling of such services and changes in the mix of government and non government payments. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and operating costs of the dialysis centers. The dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $230, $227 and $229 for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The $3 increase in the per treatment costs in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to an increase in labor rates and our labor 44 hours were negatively impacted during the year as we implemented new federal guidelines. Additionally, we experienced an increase in the operating costs of our dialysis centers driven in part by the number of new centers opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, and an increase in pharmaceutical costs (primarily heparin), partially offset by a decrease in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis decreased by approximately $2 in 2007 as compared to 2006. The decrease in the per treatment costs was primarily attributable to decreases in employee benefit costs, reductions in our professional and general liability costs, as well as decreases in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by an increase in labor costs and an increase in the operating costs of our dialysis centers. General and administrative expenses. Dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses for the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006 were approximately $398 million, $397 million and $391 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $1 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to increases in labor costs and the timing of certain other expenditures, mainly offset by lower integration costs and lower professional fees. The increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $6 million in 2007 as compared to 2006, was primarily due to higher labor costs and the timing of certain expenditures, partially offset by lower integration expenditures related to the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition that were completed by the end of 2007 and lower professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives. Depreciation and amortization. Dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for 2008, 2007 and 2006 were approximately $210 million, $189 million and $171 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $21 million in depreciation and amortization for dialysis and related lab services in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to growth through new center developments and expansions and an increase in amortization expense as a result of reductions in the intangible liability associated with the Product Supply Agreement, as discussed below. The increase in depreciation and amortization for 2007 of approximately $18 million, as compared to 2006 was primarily due to growth through new center developments and expansions. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for dialysis and related lab services was 2.6% for all years presented. The current provision level of 2.6% may increase if we encounter problems with our billing and collection process. Product Supply Agreement. We entered into the Alliance and Product Supply Agreement with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. on October 5, 2005, in conjunction with our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. The agreement committed us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices through 2015. The agreement was amended on August 25, 2006 (the Amended Product Supply Agreement) to reduce our purchase obligations for certain hemodialysis product supplies and equipment. As a result of the reductions, we recorded a net valuation gain of $38 million during 2006. This valuation gain represents the difference in the amortized original fair value between the Product Supply Agreement and that of the Amended Product Supply Agreement, as of the effective date of the amendment. In 2007, we terminated our obligation to purchase certain dialysis machines under the Amended Product Supply Agreement. As a result of that termination we recorded a net valuation gain of $55 million in 2007. This valuation gain represents the difference in the amortized original fair value of the Amended Product Supply Agreement and that of the Amended Product Supply Agreement as adjusted for the termination of the obligation to purchase certain dialysis machines as of June 30, 2007. We continue to be subject to the Product Supply Agreements requirements to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis non equipment product supplies, such as dialyzers, from Gambro Renal Products at fixed prices. 45 Operating income Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2008 decreased by approximately $50 million as compared to 2007. Operating income in 2007 included a valuation gain of $55 million on the Product Supply Agreement and $7 million of insurance settlements relating to Hurricane Katrina as discussed above. Excluding these items, operating income for 2008 would have increased by approximately $12 million as compared to adjusted operating income for 2007. The increase in the operating income for 2008 as compared to adjusted operating income for 2007 was primarily due to growth in the volume of revenue outpacing increases in certain expenditures. However, operating income for 2008 was negatively affected by certain significant items such as a decrease in our dialysis revenue per treatment, lower intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, an increase in labor costs and higher operating costs of our dialysis centers primarily associated with the number of new centers that were opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, an increase in pharmaceutical costs (primarily heparin), and the absence of a Medicare rate increase. Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2007 increased by approximately $164 million as compared to 2006. 2007 and 2006 included valuation gains of $55 million and $38 million, respectively, on the product supply agreement. 2007 also included a $7 million insurance settlement as discussed above. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income for 2007 would have increased by approximately $140 million as compared to adjusted operating income for 2006. This large increase was driven primarily by growth in both treatments and revenue per treatment, along with labor productivity improvements, and reductions in certain operating expenditures such as benefit and insurance costs, as well as integration expenditures. Other Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Year ended 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 245 $ 134 $ 82 Segment loss $ (34 ) $ (51 ) $ (27 ) Net operating revenues The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $111 million or 83% as compared to 2007, primarily from growth in our pharmacy business, VillageHealth special needs plans and demonstration projects, our vascular access services business and a full year of operations of HomeChoice Partners, our infusion therapy business, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2007. The increase in net operating revenues in 2007 of approximately $52 million or 64% from 2006 was primarily due to growth in our pharmacy business, the acquisition of HomeChoice Partners, and growth in our VillageHealth demonstration projects. Operating expenses Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2008 increased by approximately $93 million from 2007, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business, an increase in fixed operating expenses, an increase in labor costs and a full year of operations of our infusion therapy services, partially offset by lower professional fees in our VillageHealth business, as described below. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2007 increased by approximately $76 million from 2006, primarily due to the acquisition of HomeChoice Partners, volume growth in our pharmacy business, additional operating expenses and professional fees associated with establishing the VillageHealth special needs plans that became effective in early 2007, and higher labor and benefit costs. 46 Operating loss Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2008 decreased by approximately $17 million from 2007. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to growth in revenues outpacing increases in operating expenses, primarily associated with our pharmacy business and our vascular access services. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2007 increased by approximately $24 million from 2006. The increase in operating losses was primarily related to the cost of establishing the VillageHealth special needs plans. Corporate level charges Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation of approximately $41 million for 2008 increased by approximately $7 million from 2007. Stock based compensation for 2007 increased by approximately $8 million from 2006. The increases in both periods resulted from increases in both the average grant date fair value and aggregate quantity, of grants that contributed expense to each of these years. Minority interests and equity income, net. Minority interests and equity income, net, increased by approximately $1.1 million in 2008, and increased by approximately $9.7 million in 2007. The increases for both years were primarily due to an increase in new dialysis centers having minority partners, growth in the earnings of our existing dialysis joint ventures and an increase in the number of other non wholly owned subsidiaries. Debt expense. Debt expense for 2008, 2007, and 2006 consisted of interest expense of approximately $215 million, $243 million, and $263 million, respectively, amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $10 million for each year presented. 2007 and 2006 also included the write off of approximately $4 million and $3 million, respectively, of deferred financing costs associated with the principal prepayments on our term loans. The decrease in interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Our overall weighted average interest rate in 2008 was 5.82% as compared to 6.49% in 2007. The decrease in interest expense in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to lower average outstanding principal balances during 2007 under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities as a result of principal prepayments, and decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Our overall weighted average interest rate in 2007 was 6.49% as compared to 6.64% in 2006. Other income. Other income was approximately $12 million, $22 million, and $13 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, and consisted principally of interest income. The decrease in other income in 2008 was primarily due to the fact that 2007 other income included gains on the sale of investments of approximately $6 million resulting from the sale of our NxStage shares as discussed below and a decrease in interest rates as well as lower average cash and investment balances. Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for 2008 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 38.6%, compared with 39.2% and 39.2% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2008 was primarily due to nonrecurring tax benefits associated with transactions occurring in 2008. We currently project the effective income tax rate for 2009 to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses, and our investments in ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. These types of adjustments are charged directly to the corresponding operating segment that incurred the charge. 47 Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2008 and 2007 represented approximately 70 and 66 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt provision. The relative increase in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2008 was a result of growth and slower cash collections. In 2007, we experienced high cash collections, which significantly decreased the number of days of net revenue in our account receivable balances. Accounts receivable balances of 70 days of revenue is more consistent with our past and expected trends. As of December 31, 2008 approximately $102 million in unreserved accounts receivable, representing approximately 9% of our total accounts receivable balance, were more than six months old. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than 1% of our treatments are classified as patient pay. Substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, other than the standard monthly processing, consisted of approximately $39 million and $31 million, respectively, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Currently, our Medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. However, the payment received from Medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. Such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements, except for potentially limiting the collectibility of these Medicare bad debt claims. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2008, our cash balance was $411 million and we had undrawn credit under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $250 million, of which approximately $51 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2008 amounted to $556 million, compared with $533 million for 2007. Cash flow from operations in 2008 included cash interest payments of approximately $223 million and cash tax payments of $163 million. Cash flow from operations in 2007 included cash interest payments of $245 million and cash tax payments of $206 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2008 included $318 million for capital asset expenditures, including $213 million for new center developments and relocations, and $105 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $126 million for acquisitions. During 2008, we also received $43 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition we received $48 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also repurchased 4.8 million shares of our common stock for approximately $233 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2007 included $272 million for capital asset expenditures, including $162 million for new center developments and relocations and $110 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $127 million for acquisitions. During 2007, we also received $37 million from the maturity and sale of investments as well as an additional $88 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and related excess tax benefits. We also repurchased 0.1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $6 million. During 2008, we acquired a total of 20 dialysis centers, opened 87 new dialysis centers, sold or closed nine centers, merged eight centers into other existing centers, ceased operations at one joint venture in which we owned a noncontrolling interest and added a net one center under management and administrative service agreements. During 2007, we acquired a total of 16 dialysis centers, opened 64 new dialysis centers, sold or closed six centers and discontinued providing management and administrative services to 21 centers. We also acquired a 50% noncontrolling ownership interest in a joint venture that operated six dialysis centers. 48 We currently expect to spend approximately $100 million for general maintenance capital asset expenditures in 2009, and approximately $250 million for new center development, relocations and center acquisitions depending upon the availability of certain projects and sufficient project returns. We expect to generate approximately $500 million to $550 million of operating cash flow in 2009. Our actual expenditures for growth and cash flows in 2009 could vary significantly from these expected amounts. 2008 capital structure changes and other items Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain customary affirmative and negative covenants and require compliance with financial covenants, including an interest rate coverage ratio and a leverage ratio that determines the interest rate margins on our term loan A and our revolving line of credit. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities in general also contain limits on the general amount of capital expenditures for internal growth, acquisitions and capital improvements, as described below, as well as limits on the amount of tangible net assets in non guarantor subsidiaries. Term Loan A During 2008, we made mandatory principal payments totaling $14.9 million on the term loan A. As a result of these principal payments, the outstanding balance on our term loan A as of December 31, 2008 was $214.4 million and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall weighted average effective rate of 1.97%. The interest rate margin is subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term loan A matures in October 2011 and requires annual principal payments of $61.3 million in 2009, $87.5 million in 2010 and $65.6 million in 2011, respectively. Term Loan B As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance of our term loan B was $1.7 billion and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% for an overall weighted average effective rate of 3.63%, including the impact of our swap agreements. We did not make any principal payments on the term loan B during 2008, nor were we required to. Term loan B matures in October 2012 and requires principal payments of $1.7 billion in year 2012. Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes Our senior and senior subordinated notes, as of December 31, 2008, consisted of $900 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments in March and September. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2008, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $790 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.54% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2009 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2008, 2007, and 2006 we accrued net cash (obligations) benefits of approximately ($4.2) million, $14.5 million, and $15.8 million, respectively, from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. We estimate that approximately $14.3 million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2008 will be reclassified into income in 2009. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the total fair value of these swaps was a liability of $21.9 million and a net 49 liability of $0.5 million, respectively. The 2008 and 2007 amounts were primarily included in other long term liabilities. Also during 2008 and 2007, we recorded approximately $10.4 million and $16.0 million, respectively, net of tax, as reductions to other comprehensive income for swap valuation losses, net of amounts reclassified into income. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 41% of our variable rate debt and approximately 69% of our total debt was economically fixed. As a result of the swap agreements, our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 3.48%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, our overall average effective interest rate was 5.10%. Stock repurchases During 2008, we repurchased a total of 4,788,881 shares of our common stock for $232.7 million, or an average price of $48.59 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. On May 1, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of an additional $143.5 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2008 was $153.5 million. This stock repurchase program has no expiration date. Stock based compensation Under SFAS No. 123(R), stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of the stock based award vesting during that period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 includes compensation cost for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of, December 31, 2005 and stock based awards granted thereafter. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in all prior periods. During 2008, we granted 4,563,350 stock settled stock appreciation rights with a grant date fair value of $50.2 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 3.35 years, and also granted 37,819 stock units with a grant date fair value of $1.9 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 1.1 years. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we recognized $41.2 million and $34.1 million, respectively, in stock based compensation expense for stock options, stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock units and discounted employee stock plan purchases, which is primarily included in general and administrative expenses. The estimated tax benefits recorded for this stock based compensation in 2008 and 2007 were $15.6 million and $12.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, there was $79.6 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we received $35.6 million and $54.7 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $14.0 million and $32.8 million, respectively, in total actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. Developments in 2008 In July 2008, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act for 2008 was passed by Congress. This legislation provides for an increase in the composite rate of 1% in 2009 and in 2010. In addition this 50 legislation introduces a new payment system for dialysis services beginning in January 2011 whereby ESRD payments will be made under a bundled payment rate which will provide for a fixed rate for all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment, including laboratory services and the administration of pharmaceuticals. The initial 2011 bundled rate will be set 2% below the payment rate that providers would have received under the historical fee for service payment methodology. Beginning in 2012, a new single bundled payment base rate will be adjusted annually for inflation based upon a market basket index, less 1% of such index. The bundled payment rate will be determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who will have discretion to determine the base payment rate based on the goods and services included in the bundled rate. Dialysis providers will have the option to move fully to the bundled payment system in 2011 or to phase in the payment system over three years. In February 2008, Baxter Healthcare Corporation proceeded with a recall of heparin, a pharmaceutical used in the treatment of dialysis patients, and ceased further sales. As a result of the recall, there is only one remaining supplier of heparin and the cost to purchase heparin has significantly increased. It is possible that our heparin costs may continue to increase and since there is no separate reimbursement for this drug under Medicare, cost increases have a direct impact on our profitability. An affiliate of Fresenius Medical Care acquired the sole remaining provider of heparin for the U.S. dialysis market. This could negatively impact our access to and pricing for this critical product. 2007 capital structure changes and other capital items During 2007, we made principal payments totaling $50 million on term loan A and $400 million on term loan B. The term loan B payment was made from the proceeds of new senior notes as discussed below. These principal payments were prepayments. As a result of the principal prepayments made in 2007 we wrote off a total of $4.4 million of deferred financing costs, which is included in debt expense. Term Loan A On February 27, 2007, our interest rate margin on term loan A was reduced by 0.25% as a result of our achieving certain financial ratios as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. At December 31, 2007, our term loan A bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall effective rate of 6.35%. The interest rate margin is subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term Loan B On February 23, 2007, we amended and restated our existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities to, among other things, reduce the interest rate margin on term loan B by 0.50%, and to amend certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2007, the amended term loan B bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall effective rate of 5.80%, including the impact of our swap agreements, except for the forward interest rate swap agreements. Other terms that were changed included the amount by which we can elect to increase the revolving and term loan commitments from $500 million to $750 million and certain limitations on purchases, redemptions or acquisitions of capital stock, the payment of dividends and distributions in cash. Further, limitations on capital expenditures for internal growth will not apply during the periods in which our leverage ratio is less than 3.5:1. We incurred financing costs of $1.8 million which were deferred and also expensed $0.2 million of other costs in connection with this transaction. Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes On February 23, 2007, we issued $400 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 in a private offering, realizing $405 million in proceeds, which included a $5 million premium, and incurred $2.7 million in related deferred financing costs. These senior notes are part of the same series of debt securities as the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% senior notes that were issued in March 2005. Our effective interest rate for 51 the $400 million of 6 5/8% senior notes is 6.45%. The senior notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments which began March 15, 2007. The senior notes may be redeemed by us in whole or part at any time on or after March 15, 2009, at certain specified prices. We used $400 million of these proceeds to pay down our term loan B as discussed above. NxStage agreement In February 2007 we entered into a National Provider Agreement with NxStage, Inc. As a part of the agreement, we purchased outright all of our NxStage System One equipment then in use for $5.1 million, and have been purchasing a majority of our home based hemodialysis equipment and supplies from NxStage. In connection with the provider agreement, we purchased two million shares of NxStage common stock in a private placement offering for $20 million, representing an ownership position of approximately 7%. We subsequently sold our NxStage Inc. shares in the second and third quarters of 2007 for approximately $25.9 million and recognized a pre tax gain of $5.9 million or $3.6 million after tax. This pre tax gain is included in other income. Other stockholder items On May 29, 2007, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to increase the number of shares of authorized common stock from 195,000,000 to 450,000,000 shares. Our stockholders also approved an amendment and restatement of our Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under that plan by 800,001 shares, and approved an amendment and restatement of our 2002 Equity Compensation Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under that plan by 6,000,000 shares and, among other things, to remove certain available share recycling features, to change the limit on the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be subject to awards granted to any single recipient in any consecutive twenty four month period so that it applies only to awards of stock options and stock appreciation rights, and to provide additional exceptions from the three year minimum vesting period generally applicable to grants of restricted stock units and other full share awards. Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2007, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $968 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.37%, on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2009 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. In addition, we also maintained two forward interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $200 million that went effective on September 30, 2008. As of December 31, 2007, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 50% of our variable rate debt and approximately 74% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements, at December 31, 2007 our overall weighted average effective interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 5.90%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.37%. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We also have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers and for 52 some of our non wholly owned subsidiaries in the form of put provisions, which are exercisable at the third party owners future discretion within specified periods as outlined in each specific put provision. These put provisions, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the equity interest put to us, which is intended to approximate fair value. We have estimated the fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions based upon either a predetermined multiple of earnings, or the higher of a liquidation value or an average multiple of earnings determined by historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. The estimate of the fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions is a critical accounting estimate that involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which these obligations may ultimately be settled in the future, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the credit and capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners interests. For additional information, see Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements. We also have potential cash commitments to provide working capital advances as needed to several other dialysis centers in which we either own a noncontrolling interest, or which are wholly owned by third parties, as well as to physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under management and administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2008 (in millions): Less Than1 year 1 3years 3 5years After5 years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 72 $ 156 $ 2,607 $ 850 $ 3,685 Interest payments on senior and senior subordinated notes 121 243 213 92 669 Capital lease obligations 1 1 1 3 6 Operating leases 194 333 257 393 1,177 $ 388 $ 733 $ 3,078 $ 1,338 $ 5,537 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 51 $ $ $ $ 51 Acquisition of dialysis centers under put provisions 127 64 61 39 291 Pay fixed swaps potential obligations 14 8 22 Working capital advances 16 16 $ 208 $ 72 $ 61 $ 39 $ 380 Not included above are interest payments related to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2008 bear interest at LIBOR plus current margins of 1.50%. The term loan A and the revolving line of credit are adjustable depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2008, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities had an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 3.48%, including the effects of our swap agreements. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific debt tranches within each term loan, which can range in maturity from one month to twelve months. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of mandatory principal payments and principal prepayments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no principal prepayments on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities during 2009 and no changes in the effective interest rate, approximately $67 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2009. 53 In addition to the above commitments, we are obligated to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products and supplies at fixed prices through 2015 from Gambro Renal Products, Inc. in connection with the Product Supply Agreement. Our total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs in each year. The actual amount of purchases in future years under the Product Supply Agreement will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, and Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. The pay fixed swap obligations represent the estimated fair market values of our interest rate swap agreements as reported by various broker dealers that are based upon relevant observable market inputs as well as other current market conditions that existed as of December 31, 2008, and represent the estimated potential obligation that we would be required to pay based upon future settlement of each specific tranche within the swap agreements. The actual amount of our obligation associated with these swaps in the future will depend upon changes in interest rates that can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions, and other relevant factors that can affect the fair market value of these swap agreements. Settlements of approximately $12.0 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made. Contingencies The majority of our revenues are from government programs and may be subject to adjustment as a result of: (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; and (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements. In addition, our revenues from commercial payors may be subject to adjustment as a result of potential claims for refunds, as a result of government actions or as a result of other claims by commercial payors. Inquiries by the Federal Government In December 2008, we received a subpoena for documents from the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, relating to the pharmaceutical products Zemplar, Hectorol, Venofer, Ferrlicit and Epogen&reg;, or EPO, as well as other related matters. The subpoena covers the period from January 2003 to the present. We have been in contact with the United States Attorneys Office, or U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Northern District of Georgia and the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, DC, since November 2008 relating to this matter, and have been advised that this is a civil inquiry. We are cooperating with the inquiry and are producing the requested records. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated, or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoena will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In February 2007, we received a request for information from the OIG for records relating to EPO claims submitted to Medicare. In August 2007, we received a subpoena from the OIG seeking similar documents. The requested documents relate to services provided from 2001 to 2004 by a number of our centers. The request and subpoena were sent from the OIGs offices in Houston and Dallas, Texas. We are cooperating with the inquiry and are producing the requested records. We have been in contact with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Texas, which has stated that this is a civil inquiry related to EPO claims. There appears to be substantial overlap between this issue and the ongoing review of EPO utilization and claims by the U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis described below. To our knowledge, no 54 proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to these inquiries will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In March 2005, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. The subpoena requires production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including documents related to, among other things, pharmaceutical and other services provided to patients, relationships with pharmaceutical companies, and financial relationships with physicians and joint ventures. The subpoena covers the period from December 1, 1996 through the present. In October 2005, we received a follow up request for additional documents related to specific medical director and joint venture arrangements. In February 2006, we received an additional subpoena for documents, including certain patient records relating to the administration and billing of EPO. In May 2007, we received a request for documents related to durable medical equipment and supply companies owned and operated by us. We are cooperating with the inquiry and are producing the requested records. The subpoenas have been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as this to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoenas will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. In October 2004, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. The subpoena covers the period from 1996 to present and requires the production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including DaVita Laboratory Services. Gambro Healthcare received a similar subpoena in November 2004. The subpoena also includes specific requests for documents relating to testing for parathyroid hormone levels, or PTH, and to products relating to vitamin D therapies. The subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena, including Fresenius Medical Group. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoena will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. Other We have received several notices of claims from commercial payors and other third parties related to historical billing practices and claims against DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare) related to historical Gambro Healthcare billing practices and other matters covered by their 2004 settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the U.S. government. At least one commercial payor has filed an arbitration demand against us, as described below, and additional commercial payors have threatened litigation. We intend to defend against these claims vigorously; however, we may not be successful and these claims may lead to litigation and any such litigation may be resolved unfavorably. Several wage and hour claims have been filed against us in the Superior Court of California, each of which has been styled as a class action. In February 2007, June 2008, October 2008 and December 2008, we were served with separate complaints by various former employees, each of which alleges, among other things, that we failed to provide rest and meal periods, failed to pay compensation in lieu of providing such rest or meal periods, 55 and failed to comply with certain other California labor code requirements. In October 2008, we were served with a complaint which alleges, among other things, that we failed to pay the rate on the wage statement, and failed to comply with other California labor code requirements. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of these matters as class actions. In October 2007, we were contacted by the Attorney Generals Office for the State of Nevada. The Attorney Generals Office informed us that it was conducting a civil and criminal investigation of our operations in Nevada and that the investigation related to the billing of pharmaceuticals, including EPO. In February 2008, the Attorney Generals Office informed us that the civil and criminal investigation has been discontinued. The Attorney Generals Office further advised us that Nevada Medicaid intends to conduct audits of ESRD providers in Nevada, including us, and that such audits will relate to the issues that were the subjects of the investigation. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. In August 2007, Sheet Metal Workers National Health Fund and Glenn Randle filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against us. The complaint also names as defendants Amgen Inc. and Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. The complaint is styled as a class action and alleges four claims against us, including violations of the federal RICO statute, Californias unfair competition law, Californias false advertising law and for unjust enrichment. The complaints principal allegations against us are that the defendants engaged in a scheme to unlawfully promote the administration of EPO to hemodialysis patients intravenously, as opposed to subcutaneously, and to over utilize EPO. On December 17, 2008, the Court dismissed the complaint and allegations in their entirety with permission of plaintiffs to amend the complaint. We were not named as a defendant in plaintiffs amended complaint. As a result, we are no longer a defendant in this action. In August 2005, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against Gambro AB, DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare) and related entities. The plaintiff sought to bring its claims as a class action on behalf of itself and all entities that paid any of the defendants for health care goods and services from on or about January 1991 through at least December 2004. The complaint alleged, among other things, damages resulting from facts and circumstances underlying Gambro Healthcares December 2004 settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States Government. In March 2006, the case was dismissed and the plaintiff was compelled to seek arbitration to resolve the matter. In November 2006, the plaintiff filed a demand for class arbitration against us and DVA Renal Healthcare. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or the potential range of damages, if any. In June 2004, Gambro Healthcare was served with a complaint filed in the Superior Court of California by one of its former employees who worked for its California acute services program. The complaint, which is styled as a class action, alleges, among other things, that DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare) failed to provide overtime wages, defined rest periods and meal periods, or compensation in lieu of such provisions and failed to comply with certain other California labor code requirements. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or the potential range of damages, if any. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits, including from time to time, contractual disputes and professional and general liability claims, as well as audits and investigations by various government entities, in the ordinary course of business. We believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 56 Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly variable compensation accruals, purchase accounting valuation estimates, fair value estimates and stock based compensation are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, slow down in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 112,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as 6% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. 57 Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairments of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments in third party dialysis businesses, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers or other operations. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year, and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties, which went effective January 1, 2007, we assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain and future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. We make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets, liabilities and contractual as well as non contractual contingencies associated with our acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Long lived tangible and intangible assets are subject to our regular ongoing impairment assessments. Fair value estimates. We measure the fair value of certain assets, liabilities and commitments in accordance with SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements. Under SFAS No. 157, fair value is defined and is measured based upon certain valuation techniques that include inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets, liabilities and commitments. We have measured the fair values of our applicable assets, liabilities and commitments based upon certain market inputs and assumptions that are either observable or unobservable in determining fair values and have also classified these assets, liabilities and commitments into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels as defined in SFAS No. 157. The fair value of our investments held for sale are based upon quoted market prices and the fair value of our swap agreements are based upon valuation models and a variety of techniques as reported by various broker dealers that are based upon relevant observable market inputs such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, and other credit and liquidity market 58 conditions. For our put provisions we have estimated the fair values of the interests subject to these commitments based upon either a predetermined multiple of earnings, or the higher of a liquidation value or an average multiple of earnings determined by historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. The estimate of the fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which these obligations may ultimately be settled in the future, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the credit and capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners interests. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based awards to employees and directors in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payments. Under SFAS No. 123(R), stock based compensation is recognized during a period based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of the stock based award vesting during that period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 include compensation costs for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of December 31, 2005, and stock based awards granted thereafter. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk free interest rates. Significant new accounting standards On January 1, 2009 we adopted SFAS No. 141(R) Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations. This standard requires all business combinations to be accounted for under the acquisition method (previously referred to as the purchase method). Under the acquisition method, the acquirer recognizes the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date. Noncontractual contingencies are recognized at the acquisition date at their fair values only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6 Elements of Financial Statements. Transaction costs are excluded from the acquisition cost and will be expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration included by the acquirer as part of the purchase price must also be measured at fair value at the acquisition date and will be classified as either equity or a liability. This standard also requires a company that obtains control but acquires less than 100% of an acquiree to record 100% of the fair value of the acquiree assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests at the acquisition date. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2009 we adopted SFAS No. 160 Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, which amends Accounting Research Bulletin, No. 51 Consolidated Financial Statements. This standard requires noncontrolling interests to be treated as a separate component of equity, but apart from the parents equity, and not as a liability or other item outside of equity. This standard also specifies that consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income, and that changes in the parents ownership interest while it retains a controlling financial interest should be accounted for as equity transactions. This standard also expands disclosures in the financial statements to include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the equity attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling owners and a schedule showing the effects of changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary on the equity attributable to the parent. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements; however, it will change the presentation of minority interests in our consolidated financial statements. Although, we are still in process of determining the appropriate classification and measurement of minority interests according to SEC Topic No. 98 Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities. 59 On January 1, 2009 we adopted SFAS No. 161 Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This standard requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities. Entities will be required to provide additional disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This standard encourages but does not require comparative disclosures for earlier periods at the initial adoption. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements except for the nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are subject to a one year deferral allowed by FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS157 2 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157. This standard establishes a framework for measuring fair value and also requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard applies to assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. On January 1, 2009 we adopted certain provisions of SFAS No 157 relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). See note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of adopting this standard. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159 Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of SFAS No. 115. This standard allows companies the alternative to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis that are currently not required to be measured at fair value. The standard is also designed to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with SFAS Statement No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement attribute on all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in order to be recognized in the financial statements. In making this assessment, a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position and must assume that the tax position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. Once the recognition threshold is met, the tax position is then measured to determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. In addition, the recognition threshold of more likely than not must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of the tax benefit. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. See note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of adopting this interpretation. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2008. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average LIBOR rates in effect for all debt tranches plus margins in effect at the end of 2008 including the 60 economic effects of our swap agreements. Term loan A and revolving line of credit interest rate margins are subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio. The margins currently in effect at December 31, 2008 were 1.50%. For our interest rate swap agreements, the table below presents the notional amounts by contract maturity date and the related interest rate terms of the agreements (to pay fixed rates, and to receive LIBOR). Expected maturity date Total FairValue Averageinterestrate 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 3 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 $ 901 $ 853 $ 1,760 $ 1,668 6.88 % Variable rate $ 69 $ 89 $ 66 $ 1,706 $ 1 $ $ 1,931 $ 1,701 3.48 % Notionalamount Contract maturity date Pay fixed Receivevariable Fairvalue 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 (dollars in millions) Swaps: Pay fixed swaps $ 790 $ 401 $ 389 $ $ $ 3.08% to 4.70% LIBOR $ (21.9 ) Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which include the term loan A and the term loan B, consist of various individual tranches that can range in maturity from one month to twelve months and each specific tranche bears interest at a LIBOR rate that is determined by the maturity of that specific tranche. LIBOR based interest rates are reset as each specific tranche matures and can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions including the credit and capital markets. Any increase in the LIBOR based interest rates on the unhedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which totaled approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2008 will have a negative impact on our overall earnings. As of December 31, 2008, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $790 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.54% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2009 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2008, we accrued net cash obligations of $4.2 million from these swaps which is included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2008, the total fair value of these swaps was a liability of $21.9 million. During 2008, we recorded $10.4 million, net of tax, as a reduction to other comprehensive income for swap valuation losses, net of amounts reclassified into income. As of December 31, 2008, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 41% of our variable rate debt and approximately 69% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements, the overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 3.48%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50% as of December 31, 2008. Our overall average effective interest rate during 2008 was 5.82%. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $7.1 million, $5.5 million, and $6.8 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. 61 Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk.

We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,449 outpatient dialysis centers and 700 hospitals, serving approximately 112,000 patients in 43 states. In 2008, our overall network of dialysis centers increased by 90 centers primarily as a result of opening new centers and acquisitions and the overall number of patients that we serve increased by approximately 5%. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three stakeholders our patients, our business partners, and our teammates represent the major drivers of our long term performance, although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes as measured by DQI have improved over each of the past three years. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. In addition, over the past several years our teammate turnover has remained constant, which we believe has been a major contributor to our clinical performance improvements. We will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers. Approximately 96% of our 2008 consolidated revenues were derived directly from our dialysis and related lab services business. Approximately 82% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are derived from 37 outpatient hemodialysis services in 1,426 centers that we consolidate which are either wholly owned or majority owned. Other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services. These services collectively accounted for approximately 15% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues, and the remaining 3% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues were from laboratory services. We also generate management fees from performing management and administrative services to certain dialysis centers that represent less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. Our other business operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our patients. These consist primarily of infusion therapy services, oral pharmacy services, vascular access services, disease management services, special needs plans, physicians services and ESRD clinical research programs. These services generated approximately 4% of our consolidated net revenues in 2008. We currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives as we work to develop successful new business operations. However, significant changes in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may impact the economic viability of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes could result in a write off or an impairment of some or all of our investments in these strategic initiatives, or could also result in significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are: the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week, as well as the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services; average dialysis revenue per treatment; and the number of laboratory patient tests The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, which is influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our ability to open and acquire new centers. Our year over year treatment volume growth was 5.9% in 2008. Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, and our billing and collecting operations performance. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are significantly higher than Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment. The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008: Revenues Medicare and Medicare assigned HMO plans 59 % Medicaid 4 % Other government based programs 2 % Total government based programs 65 % Commercial (including hospital dialysis services) 35 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Government payment rates are principally determined by federal Medicare and state Medicaid policy. These payment rates have historically had limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reduction as 38 federal and state governments face increasing budget pressures. Cumulative net increases in Medicare payment rates from 1990 through 2007 totaled approximately 10%, which is less than the impact of inflation over the same period. In July 2008, Congress passed the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act. This act provides for an increase in the composite rate of 1% in 2009 and 2010. In 2011, a new payment system will be established that will provide for a single bundled payment base rate with an initial rate set at 2% below the rate we would have received under the historical methodology. Beginning in 2012, the bundled payment base rate will be adjusted annually for inflation based upon a market basket index, less 1% of such index. Dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with large payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Except for some rate reductions that occurred in late 2007, we have been successful in maintaining relatively stable average payment rates in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans, in addition to obtaining periodic rate increases. However, we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors and payors are increasingly aggressive in their negotiations. If our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, this would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We also expect that some of our contracted rates with commercial payors may decrease or we may experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. In addition, payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations on non contracted or out of network providers, which could further decrease our commercial rate revenues. Approximately 30% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were from physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for approximately 20% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. Therefore, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in private and governmental payment rates for EPO significantly influence our revenue. For example, in July 2007, CMS implemented a new reimbursement methodology for EPO which decreased our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment. In addition, effective January 2008, changes to the EPO monitoring policy went into effect which further limited reimbursements. These changes impacted the prescribing habits of our physicians, which resulted in lower pharmaceutical intensities during 2008, which negatively impacted our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in 2008. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past several years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. In 2008, we made several systems upgrades and process changes and will continue to do so in 2009 as necessary to improve our billing and collection performance. However, as we implement these system upgrades, our collection performance as well as our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment could be negatively impacted. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was approximately $334, $334 and $330 for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. In 2008, our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment decreased slightly, primarily due to the impact of some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, a decrease in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals offset by changes in mix and rates of some of our other commercial payors. In 2007, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment increased primarily due to an increase in realized rates from our commercial payors and an increase in the Medicare composite rate, partially offset by a decrease in the government reimbursement for pharmaceuticals 39 associated with the new CMS reimbursement rates for EPO, and a decrease in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, including the bundling of such services, and changes in the mix of government and commercial payors may materially impact our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in the future. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals and business infrastructure and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost changes, such as employee benefit costs and insurance costs. Our average clinical hours per treatment have remained relatively stable over the past few years primarily because of improved efficiencies driven by reduced clinical teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels previously achieved, and changes in federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. As an example, during the third and fourth quarters of 2008 we experienced an increase in our labor hours as we implemented new federal guidelines. In 2008 and 2007, we also experienced an increase in our labor rates of approximately 3.5% and 3.0%, respectively, as labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. For the past several years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors. In addition, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO provides for specific rebates based on a combination of factors, including process improvement and data submission, which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to qualify for these rebates. In 2008, we experienced increases in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new centers opened and centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, as well as general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of consolidated revenues over the past three years. However, this reflects a substantial increase in the dollar amount of spending related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal matters and supporting the growth in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. We expect that the level of general and administrative expenses will be sustained and can vary depending upon the level of investment we make in our long term initiatives, including further investments in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance. Outlook for 2009. Our operating income guidance for 2009 is projected to be in the range of $820 $880 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks and uncertainties include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates or the structure of payments under the Medicare ESRD program which result in lower reimbursement for services we provide to Medicare patients, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and compliance with the corporate integrity agreement applicable to the dialysis centers acquired from Gambro Healthcare and assumed in connection with such acquisition, and the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the cautionary language contained in the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 37 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. 40 Results of operations We operate principally as a dialysis and related lab services business but also operate other ancillary services and strategic initiatives businesses. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives consist of infusion therapy services, pharmacy services, vascular access services, disease management services and full service special needs plans, physician services, as well as clinical research programs. The dialysis and related lab services business qualifies as a separately reportable segment under SFAS No. 131, and all of the other ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been combined and disclosed in the other segments category. Following is a summary of consolidated operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. Year ended December 31, Continuing Operations 2008 2007 2006 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, except per treatment data) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 5,660 100 % $ 5,264 100 % $ 4,881 100 % Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 3,920 69 % 3,590 68 % 3,390 70 % General and administrative 508 9 % 491 9 % 454 9 % Depreciation and amortization 217 4 % 193 4 % 173 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 146 3 % 137 3 % 126 2 % Minority interests and equity income, net 47 1 % 45 1 % 36 1 % Valuation gain on alliance and product supply agreement (55 ) (1 )% (38 ) (1 )% Total operating expenses and charges 4,838 85 % 4,402 84 % 4,141 85 % Operating income $ 822 15 % $ 862 16 % $ 739 15 % Dialysis treatments 16,217,107 15,318,995 14,495,796 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 51,663 48,942 46,372 Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment $ 334 $ 334 $ 330 The following table summarizes consolidated net operating revenues: Year ended 2008 2007 2006 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 5,415 $ 5,130 $ 4,799 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives 245 134 82 Consolidated net operating revenues $ 5,660 $ 5,264 $ 4,881 41 The following table summarizes consolidated operating income: Year ended 2008 2007(1) 2006(1) (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 943 $ 993 $ 829 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives loss (34 ) (51 ) (27 ) Total segment margin 910 942 802 Reconciling items: Stock based compensation (41 ) (34 ) (26 ) Minority interests and equity income, net (47 ) (45 ) (36 ) Consolidated operating income 822 862 739 Reconciliation of non GAAP measures: Less: Gains on insurance settlements (7 ) Valuation gain on the alliance and product supply agreement (55 ) (38 ) Non GAAP consolidated operating income $ 822 $ 800 $ 701 (1) We have excluded valuation gains on the alliance and product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products Inc. (the Product Supply Agreement) in 2007 and 2006 as well as gains on insurance settlements from Hurricane Katrina in 2007 from non GAAP adjusted consolidated operating income in 2007 and 2006, respectively, because management believes that this presentation enhances a users understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding a non recurring non cash gain that resulted from the termination of our purchase obligation for dialysis machines from Gambro Renal Products Inc. under the Product Supply Agreement as well as an unusual insurance gain, and as a result is both more meaningful and comparable to our current and prior period results, and more indicative of our normal consolidated operating income. Consolidated net operating revenues Consolidated net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $396 million or approximately 7.5% from 2007. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $285 million, principally due to increased treatments, and an increase of approximately $111 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues primarily from growth in our pharmacy, VillageHealth special needs plans and from our infusion therapy business. Consolidated net operating revenues for 2007 increased by approximately $383 million or approximately 7.9% from 2006. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $331 million, principally due to an increase in both treatments and average revenue per treatment, and an increase of approximately $52 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues primarily from growth in our pharmacy and in our VillageHealth demonstration projects as well as from the acquisition of our infusion therapy business. Consolidated operating income Consolidated operating income was $822 million for 2008, as compared to $862 million for 2007. Consolidated operating income in 2007 included a valuation gain of $55 million on the Product Supply Agreement and the $7 million insurance settlement related to Hurricane Katrina. Excluding the valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement and the insurance settlement in 2007, our consolidated operating income for 2008 would have increased by approximately $22 million, compared to the adjusted operating income for 2007. This increase was primarily due to treatment growth in dialysis and related lab services revenues, combined with growth in revenue in ancillary services and strategic initiatives outpacing increases in our operating expenses. Our ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating losses were reduced by approximately $17 million in 42 2008. However, our consolidated operating income for 2008 was negatively affected by rising labor costs, the absence of a Medicare rate increase, the impact of some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, decreases in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, an increase in the operating costs of our dialysis centers, driven in part by the number of new dialysis centers opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, an increase in pharmaceuticals costs (primarily heparin) and an increase in stock based compensation costs. Consolidated operating income was $862 million for 2007, as compared to $739 million for 2006. Consolidated operating income in 2007 and 2006 included valuation gains of $55 million and $38 million, respectively, on the Product Supply Agreement. 2007 also included a $7 million insurance settlement related to Hurricane Katrina. Excluding these items our adjusted consolidated operating income for 2007 would have increased by approximately $99 million compared to our adjusted consolidated operating income for 2006. The increase in adjusted consolidated operating income was primarily due to an increase in both treatment growth and revenue per treatment in the dialysis and related lab services business outpacing slower growth in operating expenses, lower self insurance and benefit costs, as well as reductions in integration expenditures. The increase in adjusted consolidated income in 2007 was primarily the result of increases in operating income in the dialysis and related lab services business, partially offset by higher operating losses in ancillary services and strategic initiatives that increased by approximately $24 million, as we made additional investments in our infrastructure and incurred additional operating expenses and professional fees associated with establishing our VillageHealth special needs plans. Operating segments Dialysis and Related Lab Services Year ended 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 5,415 $ 5,130 $ 4,799 Segment margin $ 943 $ 993 $ 829 Net operating revenues Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $285 million or approximately 5.6% from 2007. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 5.9%, offset by a slight decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment. The increase in number of treatments was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatment days in 2008 and non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. The decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily due to the impact of some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, decreases in intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals partially offset by changes in mix and rates of some of our other commercial payors. Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2007 increased by approximately $331 million or 6.9% from 2006. The increase in net operating revenues in 2007 was principally due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 5.7% and an increase in the average revenue per treatment of approximately 1.2%. The increase in the number of treatments was primarily attributable to non acquired annual treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. Our average dialysis revenue per treatment increased from $330 in 2006 to $334 in 2007. This increase in average dialysis revenue per treatment was due primarily to an increase in realized rates from our commercial payors and an increase in the Medicare composite rate, partially offset by a decrease in the government reimbursement for pharmaceuticals associated with the new CMS reimbursement rates for EPO, and a decrease in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. 43 The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues by source for the year ended December 31, 2008: Revenuepercentages Outpatient hemodialysis centers 82 % Peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis 10 % Hospital inpatient hemodialysis 5 % Laboratory services 3 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % In addition to reimbursements for dialysis treatments, the other major component of dialysis and related lab services revenues is the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents slightly more than 30% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues. Approximately 65% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage Plans, representing approximately 87% of our total patients. Approximately 35% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues and 13% of our patients are associated with commercial payors. Less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services payments are due directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 5% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. On average we are paid significantly more for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans than we are for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other government plans. Patients covered by employer group health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. As of December 31, 2008, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $149 and $165 per treatment, or an overall average of $157 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Our net earnings from dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates and others of which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. We are continuously in negotiations with commercial payors for contracted rates and some of these payment rates are under downward pressure as we negotiate these rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers and we expect this trend to continue into 2009. We also expect that we may experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. If we experience a net overall reduction in our contracted commercial rates as a result of these negotiations, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors, including our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted and non contracted commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, including the bundling of such services and changes in the mix of government and non government payments. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and operating costs of the dialysis centers. The dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $230, $227 and $229 for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The $3 increase in the per treatment costs in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to an increase in labor rates and our labor 44 hours were negatively impacted during the year as we implemented new federal guidelines. Additionally, we experienced an increase in the operating costs of our dialysis centers driven in part by the number of new centers opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, and an increase in pharmaceutical costs (primarily heparin), partially offset by a decrease in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis decreased by approximately $2 in 2007 as compared to 2006. The decrease in the per treatment costs was primarily attributable to decreases in employee benefit costs, reductions in our professional and general liability costs, as well as decreases in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by an increase in labor costs and an increase in the operating costs of our dialysis centers. General and administrative expenses. Dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses for the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006 were approximately $398 million, $397 million and $391 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $1 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to increases in labor costs and the timing of certain other expenditures, mainly offset by lower integration costs and lower professional fees. The increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $6 million in 2007 as compared to 2006, was primarily due to higher labor costs and the timing of certain expenditures, partially offset by lower integration expenditures related to the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition that were completed by the end of 2007 and lower professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives. Depreciation and amortization. Dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for 2008, 2007 and 2006 were approximately $210 million, $189 million and $171 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $21 million in depreciation and amortization for dialysis and related lab services in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to growth through new center developments and expansions and an increase in amortization expense as a result of reductions in the intangible liability associated with the Product Supply Agreement, as discussed below. The increase in depreciation and amortization for 2007 of approximately $18 million, as compared to 2006 was primarily due to growth through new center developments and expansions. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for dialysis and related lab services was 2.6% for all years presented. The current provision level of 2.6% may increase if we encounter problems with our billing and collection process. Product Supply Agreement. We entered into the Alliance and Product Supply Agreement with Gambro AB and Gambro Renal Products, Inc. on October 5, 2005, in conjunction with our acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. The agreement committed us to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products, supplies and equipment at fixed prices through 2015. The agreement was amended on August 25, 2006 (the Amended Product Supply Agreement) to reduce our purchase obligations for certain hemodialysis product supplies and equipment. As a result of the reductions, we recorded a net valuation gain of $38 million during 2006. This valuation gain represents the difference in the amortized original fair value between the Product Supply Agreement and that of the Amended Product Supply Agreement, as of the effective date of the amendment. In 2007, we terminated our obligation to purchase certain dialysis machines under the Amended Product Supply Agreement. As a result of that termination we recorded a net valuation gain of $55 million in 2007. This valuation gain represents the difference in the amortized original fair value of the Amended Product Supply Agreement and that of the Amended Product Supply Agreement as adjusted for the termination of the obligation to purchase certain dialysis machines as of June 30, 2007. We continue to be subject to the Product Supply Agreements requirements to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis non equipment product supplies, such as dialyzers, from Gambro Renal Products at fixed prices. 45 Operating income Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2008 decreased by approximately $50 million as compared to 2007. Operating income in 2007 included a valuation gain of $55 million on the Product Supply Agreement and $7 million of insurance settlements relating to Hurricane Katrina as discussed above. Excluding these items, operating income for 2008 would have increased by approximately $12 million as compared to adjusted operating income for 2007. The increase in the operating income for 2008 as compared to adjusted operating income for 2007 was primarily due to growth in the volume of revenue outpacing increases in certain expenditures. However, operating income for 2008 was negatively affected by certain significant items such as a decrease in our dialysis revenue per treatment, lower intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, an increase in labor costs and higher operating costs of our dialysis centers primarily associated with the number of new centers that were opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, an increase in pharmaceutical costs (primarily heparin), and the absence of a Medicare rate increase. Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2007 increased by approximately $164 million as compared to 2006. 2007 and 2006 included valuation gains of $55 million and $38 million, respectively, on the product supply agreement. 2007 also included a $7 million insurance settlement as discussed above. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income for 2007 would have increased by approximately $140 million as compared to adjusted operating income for 2006. This large increase was driven primarily by growth in both treatments and revenue per treatment, along with labor productivity improvements, and reductions in certain operating expenditures such as benefit and insurance costs, as well as integration expenditures. Other Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Year ended 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 245 $ 134 $ 82 Segment loss $ (34 ) $ (51 ) $ (27 ) Net operating revenues The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $111 million or 83% as compared to 2007, primarily from growth in our pharmacy business, VillageHealth special needs plans and demonstration projects, our vascular access services business and a full year of operations of HomeChoice Partners, our infusion therapy business, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2007. The increase in net operating revenues in 2007 of approximately $52 million or 64% from 2006 was primarily due to growth in our pharmacy business, the acquisition of HomeChoice Partners, and growth in our VillageHealth demonstration projects. Operating expenses Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2008 increased by approximately $93 million from 2007, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business, an increase in fixed operating expenses, an increase in labor costs and a full year of operations of our infusion therapy services, partially offset by lower professional fees in our VillageHealth business, as described below. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2007 increased by approximately $76 million from 2006, primarily due to the acquisition of HomeChoice Partners, volume growth in our pharmacy business, additional operating expenses and professional fees associated with establishing the VillageHealth special needs plans that became effective in early 2007, and higher labor and benefit costs. 46 Operating loss Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2008 decreased by approximately $17 million from 2007. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to growth in revenues outpacing increases in operating expenses, primarily associated with our pharmacy business and our vascular access services. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2007 increased by approximately $24 million from 2006. The increase in operating losses was primarily related to the cost of establishing the VillageHealth special needs plans. Corporate level charges Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation of approximately $41 million for 2008 increased by approximately $7 million from 2007. Stock based compensation for 2007 increased by approximately $8 million from 2006. The increases in both periods resulted from increases in both the average grant date fair value and aggregate quantity, of grants that contributed expense to each of these years. Minority interests and equity income, net. Minority interests and equity income, net, increased by approximately $1.1 million in 2008, and increased by approximately $9.7 million in 2007. The increases for both years were primarily due to an increase in new dialysis centers having minority partners, growth in the earnings of our existing dialysis joint ventures and an increase in the number of other non wholly owned subsidiaries. Debt expense. Debt expense for 2008, 2007, and 2006 consisted of interest expense of approximately $215 million, $243 million, and $263 million, respectively, amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $10 million for each year presented. 2007 and 2006 also included the write off of approximately $4 million and $3 million, respectively, of deferred financing costs associated with the principal prepayments on our term loans. The decrease in interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Our overall weighted average interest rate in 2008 was 5.82% as compared to 6.49% in 2007. The decrease in interest expense in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to lower average outstanding principal balances during 2007 under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities as a result of principal prepayments, and decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Our overall weighted average interest rate in 2007 was 6.49% as compared to 6.64% in 2006. Other income. Other income was approximately $12 million, $22 million, and $13 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, and consisted principally of interest income. The decrease in other income in 2008 was primarily due to the fact that 2007 other income included gains on the sale of investments of approximately $6 million resulting from the sale of our NxStage shares as discussed below and a decrease in interest rates as well as lower average cash and investment balances. Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for 2008 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 38.6%, compared with 39.2% and 39.2% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2008 was primarily due to nonrecurring tax benefits associated with transactions occurring in 2008. We currently project the effective income tax rate for 2009 to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangibles, investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses, and our investments in ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. These types of adjustments are charged directly to the corresponding operating segment that incurred the charge. 47 Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2008 and 2007 represented approximately 70 and 66 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt provision. The relative increase in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2008 was a result of growth and slower cash collections. In 2007, we experienced high cash collections, which significantly decreased the number of days of net revenue in our account receivable balances. Accounts receivable balances of 70 days of revenue is more consistent with our past and expected trends. As of December 31, 2008 approximately $102 million in unreserved accounts receivable, representing approximately 9% of our total accounts receivable balance, were more than six months old. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than 1% of our treatments are classified as patient pay. Substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, other than the standard monthly processing, consisted of approximately $39 million and $31 million, respectively, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Currently, our Medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. However, the payment received from Medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. Such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements, except for potentially limiting the collectibility of these Medicare bad debt claims. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2008, our cash balance was $411 million and we had undrawn credit under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $250 million, of which approximately $51 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2008 amounted to $556 million, compared with $533 million for 2007. Cash flow from operations in 2008 included cash interest payments of approximately $223 million and cash tax payments of $163 million. Cash flow from operations in 2007 included cash interest payments of $245 million and cash tax payments of $206 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2008 included $318 million for capital asset expenditures, including $213 million for new center developments and relocations, and $105 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $126 million for acquisitions. During 2008, we also received $43 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition we received $48 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also repurchased 4.8 million shares of our common stock for approximately $233 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2007 included $272 million for capital asset expenditures, including $162 million for new center developments and relocations and $110 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $127 million for acquisitions. During 2007, we also received $37 million from the maturity and sale of investments as well as an additional $88 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and related excess tax benefits. We also repurchased 0.1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $6 million. During 2008, we acquired a total of 20 dialysis centers, opened 87 new dialysis centers, sold or closed nine centers, merged eight centers into other existing centers, ceased operations at one joint venture in which we owned a noncontrolling interest and added a net one center under management and administrative service agreements. During 2007, we acquired a total of 16 dialysis centers, opened 64 new dialysis centers, sold or closed six centers and discontinued providing management and administrative services to 21 centers. We also acquired a 50% noncontrolling ownership interest in a joint venture that operated six dialysis centers. 48 We currently expect to spend approximately $100 million for general maintenance capital asset expenditures in 2009, and approximately $250 million for new center development, relocations and center acquisitions depending upon the availability of certain projects and sufficient project returns. We expect to generate approximately $500 million to $550 million of operating cash flow in 2009. Our actual expenditures for growth and cash flows in 2009 could vary significantly from these expected amounts. 2008 capital structure changes and other items Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain customary affirmative and negative covenants and require compliance with financial covenants, including an interest rate coverage ratio and a leverage ratio that determines the interest rate margins on our term loan A and our revolving line of credit. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities in general also contain limits on the general amount of capital expenditures for internal growth, acquisitions and capital improvements, as described below, as well as limits on the amount of tangible net assets in non guarantor subsidiaries. Term Loan A During 2008, we made mandatory principal payments totaling $14.9 million on the term loan A. As a result of these principal payments, the outstanding balance on our term loan A as of December 31, 2008 was $214.4 million and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall weighted average effective rate of 1.97%. The interest rate margin is subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term loan A matures in October 2011 and requires annual principal payments of $61.3 million in 2009, $87.5 million in 2010 and $65.6 million in 2011, respectively. Term Loan B As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance of our term loan B was $1.7 billion and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% for an overall weighted average effective rate of 3.63%, including the impact of our swap agreements. We did not make any principal payments on the term loan B during 2008, nor were we required to. Term loan B matures in October 2012 and requires principal payments of $1.7 billion in year 2012. Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes Our senior and senior subordinated notes, as of December 31, 2008, consisted of $900 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments in March and September. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2008, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $790 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.54% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2009 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2008, 2007, and 2006 we accrued net cash (obligations) benefits of approximately ($4.2) million, $14.5 million, and $15.8 million, respectively, from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. We estimate that approximately $14.3 million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2008 will be reclassified into income in 2009. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the total fair value of these swaps was a liability of $21.9 million and a net 49 liability of $0.5 million, respectively. The 2008 and 2007 amounts were primarily included in other long term liabilities. Also during 2008 and 2007, we recorded approximately $10.4 million and $16.0 million, respectively, net of tax, as reductions to other comprehensive income for swap valuation losses, net of amounts reclassified into income. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 41% of our variable rate debt and approximately 69% of our total debt was economically fixed. As a result of the swap agreements, our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 3.48%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, our overall average effective interest rate was 5.10%. Stock repurchases During 2008, we repurchased a total of 4,788,881 shares of our common stock for $232.7 million, or an average price of $48.59 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. On May 1, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of an additional $143.5 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2008 was $153.5 million. This stock repurchase program has no expiration date. Stock based compensation Under SFAS No. 123(R), stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of the stock based award vesting during that period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 includes compensation cost for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of, December 31, 2005 and stock based awards granted thereafter. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in all prior periods. During 2008, we granted 4,563,350 stock settled stock appreciation rights with a grant date fair value of $50.2 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 3.35 years, and also granted 37,819 stock units with a grant date fair value of $1.9 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 1.1 years. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we recognized $41.2 million and $34.1 million, respectively, in stock based compensation expense for stock options, stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock units and discounted employee stock plan purchases, which is primarily included in general and administrative expenses. The estimated tax benefits recorded for this stock based compensation in 2008 and 2007 were $15.6 million and $12.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, there was $79.6 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we received $35.6 million and $54.7 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $14.0 million and $32.8 million, respectively, in total actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. Developments in 2008 In July 2008, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act for 2008 was passed by Congress. This legislation provides for an increase in the composite rate of 1% in 2009 and in 2010. In addition this 50 legislation introduces a new payment system for dialysis services beginning in January 2011 whereby ESRD payments will be made under a bundled payment rate which will provide for a fixed rate for all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment, including laboratory services and the administration of pharmaceuticals. The initial 2011 bundled rate will be set 2% below the payment rate that providers would have received under the historical fee for service payment methodology. Beginning in 2012, a new single bundled payment base rate will be adjusted annually for inflation based upon a market basket index, less 1% of such index. The bundled payment rate will be determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who will have discretion to determine the base payment rate based on the goods and services included in the bundled rate. Dialysis providers will have the option to move fully to the bundled payment system in 2011 or to phase in the payment system over three years. In February 2008, Baxter Healthcare Corporation proceeded with a recall of heparin, a pharmaceutical used in the treatment of dialysis patients, and ceased further sales. As a result of the recall, there is only one remaining supplier of heparin and the cost to purchase heparin has significantly increased. It is possible that our heparin costs may continue to increase and since there is no separate reimbursement for this drug under Medicare, cost increases have a direct impact on our profitability. An affiliate of Fresenius Medical Care acquired the sole remaining provider of heparin for the U.S. dialysis market. This could negatively impact our access to and pricing for this critical product. 2007 capital structure changes and other capital items During 2007, we made principal payments totaling $50 million on term loan A and $400 million on term loan B. The term loan B payment was made from the proceeds of new senior notes as discussed below. These principal payments were prepayments. As a result of the principal prepayments made in 2007 we wrote off a total of $4.4 million of deferred financing costs, which is included in debt expense. Term Loan A On February 27, 2007, our interest rate margin on term loan A was reduced by 0.25% as a result of our achieving certain financial ratios as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. At December 31, 2007, our term loan A bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall effective rate of 6.35%. The interest rate margin is subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term Loan B On February 23, 2007, we amended and restated our existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities to, among other things, reduce the interest rate margin on term loan B by 0.50%, and to amend certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2007, the amended term loan B bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall effective rate of 5.80%, including the impact of our swap agreements, except for the forward interest rate swap agreements. Other terms that were changed included the amount by which we can elect to increase the revolving and term loan commitments from $500 million to $750 million and certain limitations on purchases, redemptions or acquisitions of capital stock, the payment of dividends and distributions in cash. Further, limitations on capital expenditures for internal growth will not apply during the periods in which our leverage ratio is less than 3.5:1. We incurred financing costs of $1.8 million which were deferred and also expensed $0.2 million of other costs in connection with this transaction. Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes On February 23, 2007, we issued $400 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 in a private offering, realizing $405 million in proceeds, which included a $5 million premium, and incurred $2.7 million in related deferred financing costs. These senior notes are part of the same series of debt securities as the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% senior notes that were issued in March 2005. Our effective interest rate for 51 the $400 million of 6 5/8% senior notes is 6.45%. The senior notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments which began March 15, 2007. The senior notes may be redeemed by us in whole or part at any time on or after March 15, 2009, at certain specified prices. We used $400 million of these proceeds to pay down our term loan B as discussed above. NxStage agreement In February 2007 we entered into a National Provider Agreement with NxStage, Inc. As a part of the agreement, we purchased outright all of our NxStage System One equipment then in use for $5.1 million, and have been purchasing a majority of our home based hemodialysis equipment and supplies from NxStage. In connection with the provider agreement, we purchased two million shares of NxStage common stock in a private placement offering for $20 million, representing an ownership position of approximately 7%. We subsequently sold our NxStage Inc. shares in the second and third quarters of 2007 for approximately $25.9 million and recognized a pre tax gain of $5.9 million or $3.6 million after tax. This pre tax gain is included in other income. Other stockholder items On May 29, 2007, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to increase the number of shares of authorized common stock from 195,000,000 to 450,000,000 shares. Our stockholders also approved an amendment and restatement of our Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under that plan by 800,001 shares, and approved an amendment and restatement of our 2002 Equity Compensation Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under that plan by 6,000,000 shares and, among other things, to remove certain available share recycling features, to change the limit on the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be subject to awards granted to any single recipient in any consecutive twenty four month period so that it applies only to awards of stock options and stock appreciation rights, and to provide additional exceptions from the three year minimum vesting period generally applicable to grants of restricted stock units and other full share awards. Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2007, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $968 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.37%, on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2009 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. In addition, we also maintained two forward interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $200 million that went effective on September 30, 2008. As of December 31, 2007, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 50% of our variable rate debt and approximately 74% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements, at December 31, 2007 our overall weighted average effective interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 5.90%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, and our overall average effective interest rate was 6.37%. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases, letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We also have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers and for 52 some of our non wholly owned subsidiaries in the form of put provisions, which are exercisable at the third party owners future discretion within specified periods as outlined in each specific put provision. These put provisions, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the equity interest put to us, which is intended to approximate fair value. We have estimated the fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions based upon either a predetermined multiple of earnings, or the higher of a liquidation value or an average multiple of earnings determined by historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. The estimate of the fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions is a critical accounting estimate that involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which these obligations may ultimately be settled in the future, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the credit and capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners interests. For additional information, see Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements. We also have potential cash commitments to provide working capital advances as needed to several other dialysis centers in which we either own a noncontrolling interest, or which are wholly owned by third parties, as well as to physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under management and administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2008 (in millions): Less Than1 year 1 3years 3 5years After5 years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 72 $ 156 $ 2,607 $ 850 $ 3,685 Interest payments on senior and senior subordinated notes 121 243 213 92 669 Capital lease obligations 1 1 1 3 6 Operating leases 194 333 257 393 1,177 $ 388 $ 733 $ 3,078 $ 1,338 $ 5,537 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 51 $ $ $ $ 51 Acquisition of dialysis centers under put provisions 127 64 61 39 291 Pay fixed swaps potential obligations 14 8 22 Working capital advances 16 16 $ 208 $ 72 $ 61 $ 39 $ 380 Not included above are interest payments related to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2008 bear interest at LIBOR plus current margins of 1.50%. The term loan A and the revolving line of credit are adjustable depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2008, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities had an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 3.48%, including the effects of our swap agreements. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific debt tranches within each term loan, which can range in maturity from one month to twelve months. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of mandatory principal payments and principal prepayments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no principal prepayments on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities during 2009 and no changes in the effective interest rate, approximately $67 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2009. 53 In addition to the above commitments, we are obligated to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products and supplies at fixed prices through 2015 from Gambro Renal Products, Inc. in connection with the Product Supply Agreement. Our total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs in each year. The actual amount of purchases in future years under the Product Supply Agreement will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, and Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. The pay fixed swap obligations represent the estimated fair market values of our interest rate swap agreements as reported by various broker dealers that are based upon relevant observable market inputs as well as other current market conditions that existed as of December 31, 2008, and represent the estimated potential obligation that we would be required to pay based upon future settlement of each specific tranche within the swap agreements. The actual amount of our obligation associated with these swaps in the future will depend upon changes in interest rates that can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions, and other relevant factors that can affect the fair market value of these swap agreements. Settlements of approximately $12.0 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made. Contingencies The majority of our revenues are from government programs and may be subject to adjustment as a result of: (1) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (2) differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities; (3) differing opinions regarding a patients medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; and (4) retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements. In addition, our revenues from commercial payors may be subject to adjustment as a result of potential claims for refunds, as a result of government actions or as a result of other claims by commercial payors. Inquiries by the Federal Government In December 2008, we received a subpoena for documents from the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, relating to the pharmaceutical products Zemplar, Hectorol, Venofer, Ferrlicit and Epogen&reg;, or EPO, as well as other related matters. The subpoena covers the period from January 2003 to the present. We have been in contact with the United States Attorneys Office, or U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Northern District of Georgia and the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, DC, since November 2008 relating to this matter, and have been advised that this is a civil inquiry. We are cooperating with the inquiry and are producing the requested records. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated, or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoena will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In February 2007, we received a request for information from the OIG for records relating to EPO claims submitted to Medicare. In August 2007, we received a subpoena from the OIG seeking similar documents. The requested documents relate to services provided from 2001 to 2004 by a number of our centers. The request and subpoena were sent from the OIGs offices in Houston and Dallas, Texas. We are cooperating with the inquiry and are producing the requested records. We have been in contact with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Texas, which has stated that this is a civil inquiry related to EPO claims. There appears to be substantial overlap between this issue and the ongoing review of EPO utilization and claims by the U.S. Attorneys Office, for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis described below. To our knowledge, no 54 proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to these inquiries will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In March 2005, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. The subpoena requires production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including documents related to, among other things, pharmaceutical and other services provided to patients, relationships with pharmaceutical companies, and financial relationships with physicians and joint ventures. The subpoena covers the period from December 1, 1996 through the present. In October 2005, we received a follow up request for additional documents related to specific medical director and joint venture arrangements. In February 2006, we received an additional subpoena for documents, including certain patient records relating to the administration and billing of EPO. In May 2007, we received a request for documents related to durable medical equipment and supply companies owned and operated by us. We are cooperating with the inquiry and are producing the requested records. The subpoenas have been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as this to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoenas will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. In October 2004, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. The subpoena covers the period from 1996 to present and requires the production of a wide range of documents relating to our operations, including DaVita Laboratory Services. Gambro Healthcare received a similar subpoena in November 2004. The subpoena also includes specific requests for documents relating to testing for parathyroid hormone levels, or PTH, and to products relating to vitamin D therapies. The subpoena has been issued in connection with a joint civil and criminal investigation. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with this inquiry. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties. Other participants in the dialysis industry received a similar subpoena, including Fresenius Medical Group. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to the subpoena will continue to require managements attention and significant legal expense. Other We have received several notices of claims from commercial payors and other third parties related to historical billing practices and claims against DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare) related to historical Gambro Healthcare billing practices and other matters covered by their 2004 settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the U.S. government. At least one commercial payor has filed an arbitration demand against us, as described below, and additional commercial payors have threatened litigation. We intend to defend against these claims vigorously; however, we may not be successful and these claims may lead to litigation and any such litigation may be resolved unfavorably. Several wage and hour claims have been filed against us in the Superior Court of California, each of which has been styled as a class action. In February 2007, June 2008, October 2008 and December 2008, we were served with separate complaints by various former employees, each of which alleges, among other things, that we failed to provide rest and meal periods, failed to pay compensation in lieu of providing such rest or meal periods, 55 and failed to comply with certain other California labor code requirements. In October 2008, we were served with a complaint which alleges, among other things, that we failed to pay the rate on the wage statement, and failed to comply with other California labor code requirements. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of these matters as class actions. In October 2007, we were contacted by the Attorney Generals Office for the State of Nevada. The Attorney Generals Office informed us that it was conducting a civil and criminal investigation of our operations in Nevada and that the investigation related to the billing of pharmaceuticals, including EPO. In February 2008, the Attorney Generals Office informed us that the civil and criminal investigation has been discontinued. The Attorney Generals Office further advised us that Nevada Medicaid intends to conduct audits of ESRD providers in Nevada, including us, and that such audits will relate to the issues that were the subjects of the investigation. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us at this time. In August 2007, Sheet Metal Workers National Health Fund and Glenn Randle filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against us. The complaint also names as defendants Amgen Inc. and Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. The complaint is styled as a class action and alleges four claims against us, including violations of the federal RICO statute, Californias unfair competition law, Californias false advertising law and for unjust enrichment. The complaints principal allegations against us are that the defendants engaged in a scheme to unlawfully promote the administration of EPO to hemodialysis patients intravenously, as opposed to subcutaneously, and to over utilize EPO. On December 17, 2008, the Court dismissed the complaint and allegations in their entirety with permission of plaintiffs to amend the complaint. We were not named as a defendant in plaintiffs amended complaint. As a result, we are no longer a defendant in this action. In August 2005, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against Gambro AB, DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare) and related entities. The plaintiff sought to bring its claims as a class action on behalf of itself and all entities that paid any of the defendants for health care goods and services from on or about January 1991 through at least December 2004. The complaint alleged, among other things, damages resulting from facts and circumstances underlying Gambro Healthcares December 2004 settlement agreement with the Department of Justice and certain agencies of the United States Government. In March 2006, the case was dismissed and the plaintiff was compelled to seek arbitration to resolve the matter. In November 2006, the plaintiff filed a demand for class arbitration against us and DVA Renal Healthcare. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or the potential range of damages, if any. In June 2004, Gambro Healthcare was served with a complaint filed in the Superior Court of California by one of its former employees who worked for its California acute services program. The complaint, which is styled as a class action, alleges, among other things, that DVA Renal Healthcare (formerly known as Gambro Healthcare) failed to provide overtime wages, defined rest periods and meal periods, or compensation in lieu of such provisions and failed to comply with certain other California labor code requirements. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. We also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or the potential range of damages, if any. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to claims and suits, including from time to time, contractual disputes and professional and general liability claims, as well as audits and investigations by various government entities, in the ordinary course of business. We believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 56 Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly variable compensation accruals, purchase accounting valuation estimates, fair value estimates and stock based compensation are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 00 1. As addressed in SOP No. 00 1, net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates, however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, slow down in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 112,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as 6% of operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. 57 Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairments of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, investments in third party dialysis businesses, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers or other operations. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year, and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties, which went effective January 1, 2007, we assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain and future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. We make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets, liabilities and contractual as well as non contractual contingencies associated with our acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Long lived tangible and intangible assets are subject to our regular ongoing impairment assessments. Fair value estimates. We measure the fair value of certain assets, liabilities and commitments in accordance with SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements. Under SFAS No. 157, fair value is defined and is measured based upon certain valuation techniques that include inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets, liabilities and commitments. We have measured the fair values of our applicable assets, liabilities and commitments based upon certain market inputs and assumptions that are either observable or unobservable in determining fair values and have also classified these assets, liabilities and commitments into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels as defined in SFAS No. 157. The fair value of our investments held for sale are based upon quoted market prices and the fair value of our swap agreements are based upon valuation models and a variety of techniques as reported by various broker dealers that are based upon relevant observable market inputs such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, and other credit and liquidity market 58 conditions. For our put provisions we have estimated the fair values of the interests subject to these commitments based upon either a predetermined multiple of earnings, or the higher of a liquidation value or an average multiple of earnings determined by historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. The estimate of the fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which these obligations may ultimately be settled in the future, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the credit and capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners interests. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based awards to employees and directors in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payments. Under SFAS No. 123(R), stock based compensation is recognized during a period based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of the stock based award vesting during that period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 include compensation costs for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of December 31, 2005, and stock based awards granted thereafter. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk free interest rates. Significant new accounting standards On January 1, 2009 we adopted SFAS No. 141(R) Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations. This standard requires all business combinations to be accounted for under the acquisition method (previously referred to as the purchase method). Under the acquisition method, the acquirer recognizes the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date. Noncontractual contingencies are recognized at the acquisition date at their fair values only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6 Elements of Financial Statements. Transaction costs are excluded from the acquisition cost and will be expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration included by the acquirer as part of the purchase price must also be measured at fair value at the acquisition date and will be classified as either equity or a liability. This standard also requires a company that obtains control but acquires less than 100% of an acquiree to record 100% of the fair value of the acquiree assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests at the acquisition date. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2009 we adopted SFAS No. 160 Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, which amends Accounting Research Bulletin, No. 51 Consolidated Financial Statements. This standard requires noncontrolling interests to be treated as a separate component of equity, but apart from the parents equity, and not as a liability or other item outside of equity. This standard also specifies that consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income, and that changes in the parents ownership interest while it retains a controlling financial interest should be accounted for as equity transactions. This standard also expands disclosures in the financial statements to include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the equity attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling owners and a schedule showing the effects of changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary on the equity attributable to the parent. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements; however, it will change the presentation of minority interests in our consolidated financial statements. Although, we are still in process of determining the appropriate classification and measurement of minority interests according to SEC Topic No. 98 Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities. 59 On January 1, 2009 we adopted SFAS No. 161 Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This standard requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities. Entities will be required to provide additional disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This standard encourages but does not require comparative disclosures for earlier periods at the initial adoption. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements except for the nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are subject to a one year deferral allowed by FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS157 2 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157. This standard establishes a framework for measuring fair value and also requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard applies to assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. On January 1, 2009 we adopted certain provisions of SFAS No 157 relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). See note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of adopting this standard. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159 Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of SFAS No. 115. This standard allows companies the alternative to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis that are currently not required to be measured at fair value. The standard is also designed to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with SFAS Statement No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement attribute on all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in order to be recognized in the financial statements. In making this assessment, a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position and must assume that the tax position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. Once the recognition threshold is met, the tax position is then measured to determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. In addition, the recognition threshold of more likely than not must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of the tax benefit. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. See note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of adopting this interpretation. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2008. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average LIBOR rates in effect for all debt tranches plus margins in effect at the end of 2008 including the 60 economic effects of our swap agreements. Term loan A and revolving line of credit interest rate margins are subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio. The margins currently in effect at December 31, 2008 were 1.50%. For our interest rate swap agreements, the table below presents the notional amounts by contract maturity date and the related interest rate terms of the agreements (to pay fixed rates, and to receive LIBOR). Expected maturity date Total FairValue Averageinterestrate 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 3 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 $ 901 $ 853 $ 1,760 $ 1,668 6.88 % Variable rate $ 69 $ 89 $ 66 $ 1,706 $ 1 $ $ 1,931 $ 1,701 3.48 % Notionalamount Contract maturity date Pay fixed Receivevariable Fairvalue 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 (dollars in millions) Swaps: Pay fixed swaps $ 790 $ 401 $ 389 $ $ $ 3.08% to 4.70% LIBOR $ (21.9 ) Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which include the term loan A and the term loan B, consist of various individual tranches that can range in maturity from one month to twelve months and each specific tranche bears interest at a LIBOR rate that is determined by the maturity of that specific tranche. LIBOR based interest rates are reset as each specific tranche matures and can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions including the credit and capital markets. Any increase in the LIBOR based interest rates on the unhedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which totaled approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2008 will have a negative impact on our overall earnings. As of December 31, 2008, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $790 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.54% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2009 through 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2008, we accrued net cash obligations of $4.2 million from these swaps which is included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2008, the total fair value of these swaps was a liability of $21.9 million. During 2008, we recorded $10.4 million, net of tax, as a reduction to other comprehensive income for swap valuation losses, net of amounts reclassified into income. As of December 31, 2008, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 41% of our variable rate debt and approximately 69% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements, the overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 3.48%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50% as of December 31, 2008. Our overall average effective interest rate during 2008 was 5.82%. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $7.1 million, $5.5 million, and $6.8 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. 61 Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk.
