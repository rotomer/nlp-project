Selected Financial Data. The following financial and operating data should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this report. The following table presents selected consolidated financial and operating data for the periods indicated. Effective January 1, 2009, we were required to present consolidated net income attributable to us and to noncontrolling interests on the face of the consolidated statement of income, which changed the presentation of minority interests (noncontrolling interests) in our consolidated statements of income. These consolidated financial results have been recast for all prior periods presented to reflect the retrospective application of adopting these new presentation and disclosure requirements for noncontrolling interests. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results from October 1, 2005, and the operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income for 2005.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements that do not concern historical facts are forward looking statements and include, among other things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, operating cash flow, estimated tax rates, capital expenditures, the development of new centers and center acquisitions, government and commercial payment rates, revenue estimating risk and the impact of our related level of indebtedness on our financial performance, including earnings per share. These statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements, including, but not limited to, risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, the variability of our cash flows, the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates or changes to the structure of payments under the Medicare ESRD program or other government based programs, including, for example, the implementation of a bundled payment rate system which will lower reimbursement for services we provide to Medicare patients, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations, the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies, and the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,530 outpatient dialysis centers and approximately 720 hospitals, serving approximately 118,000 patients in 43 states. In 2009, our overall network of dialysis centers increased by 81 centers primarily as a result of opening new centers and acquisitions and the overall number of patients that we serve increased by approximately 5.5%. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three stakeholders our patients, our business partners, and our teammates represents the major driver of our long term performance, although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes as measured by DQI have improved over each of the past three years. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. In addition, over the past several years our teammate turnover has remained relatively constant, although in 2009 we did experience a decrease in our overall teammate turnover. We believe this was a major contributor to our continued clinical performance improvements and also a major driver in our ability to improve productivity in 2009. We will continue to focus on these stakeholders and our clinical outcomes as we believe these are fundamental long term value drivers. 38 Table of Contents Approximately 95% of our 2009 consolidated net operating revenues were derived directly from our dialysis and related lab services business. Approximately 84% of our 2009 dialysis and related lab services revenues were derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in the 1,498 centers that we consolidate, which are either wholly owned or majority owned. Other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services. These services collectively accounted for the balance of our 2009 dialysis and related lab services revenues. We also generate management fees from management and administrative services to certain third party owned dialysis centers and dialysis centers that we own an equity investment in. These management fees represent less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. Our other business operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. These consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs and physician services. These services generated approximately $317 million of net operating revenues in 2009, or approximately 5% of our consolidated net operating revenues. Overall our ancillary services and strategic initiatives decreased their operating losses from $30 million in 2008 to $18 million in 2009, primarily as a result of improved profitability in our pharmacy and disease management businesses. We currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives as we work to develop successful new business operations. However, any significant change in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes could result in a write off or an impairment of some or all of our investments, including goodwill, in these strategic initiatives, or could also result in significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are: the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week, as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services; average dialysis revenue per treatment; and the number of laboratory patient tests. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, which we believe is influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our ability to open and acquire new centers. Our year over year treatment volume growth was 4.9% in 2009. Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment is primarily driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, and our billing and collecting operations performance. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are significantly higher than Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis revenue per treatment. The percentage of commercial patients covered under contracted plans as compared to commercial patients with out of network providers can also significantly affect our average dialysis revenue per treatment. In 2009, the growth of our government based patients, driven primarily by growth in Medicare assigned plans, which we believe is largely as a result of improved mortality and the current economic recession, outpaced the growth in our commercial patients, which negatively impacted our average dialysis revenue per treatment as a result of receiving lower payment rates associated with these additional government based patients. 39 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009: Revenues Medicare and Medicare assigned plans 57 % Medicaid and Medicaid assigned plans 6 % Other government based programs 2 % Total government based programs 65 % Commercial (including hospital dialysis services) 35 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Government payment rates are principally determined by federal Medicare and state Medicaid policy. These payment rates have historically had limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reduction as federal and state governments face increasing budget pressures. Medicare payment rates for dialysis services through 2008 have not been routinely increased to compensate for the impact of inflation. In July 2008, MIPPA was passed by Congress which introduced a new payment system for dialysis services beginning in January 2011 whereby ESRD payments will be made under a bundled payment rate which will provide for a fixed rate for all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment. The legislation also provided for an increase in the composite rate of 1% effective January 1, 2009 and an additional 1% effective January 1, 2010. On September 15, 2009, CMS released the proposed rule regarding the new bundled payment rate system. The initial 2011 bundled rate is required to be set based on a 2% reduction in the payment rate that providers would have received under the historical fee for service payment methodology and based on the lowest average industry pharmaceutical utilization from 2007 to 2009. The combined effect of the adjustments provided in the proposed rule would result in a bundled rate that represents a significantly greater than 2% reduction in the payment rate that we would have received for our services prior to bundling. The proposed rule also requires, among other things, the new single bundled payment base rate to be adjusted annually for inflation based upon a market basket index, less 1% of such index, beginning in 2012. Dialysis providers have the option to move fully to the bundled payment system in 2011 or to phase in the payment system over three years. Dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with large payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. In 2009, we were successful in maintaining and in some instances increasing average payment rates, resulting in an aggregate increase in average payment rates for patients with commercial plans. However, we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors and payors are aggressive in their negotiations. If our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, this would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, if there are sustained or increased job losses in the United States as a result of current economic conditions, or depending upon changes to the healthcare regulatory system, we could experience a decrease in the number of patients under commercial plans. We also expect that some of our contracted rates with commercial payors may decrease or we may experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. In addition, payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations on non contracted or out of network providers, which could further decrease our commercial rate revenues since rates for out of network providers are on average higher than rates for in network providers. Approximately 30% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were from physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for approximately 20% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. Therefore, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in commercial and governmental payment rates for EPO significantly influence our revenue. For example, effective January 2008, changes to the EPO monitoring policy went into effect which further limited reimbursements and impacted the prescribing habits of our physicians, which 40 Table of Contents resulted in lower pharmaceutical intensities during 2008. In 2009, the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals increased slightly from 2008, which helped contribute to an increase in our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past several years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. In 2009, we continued to upgrade our systems and implemented process changes and will continue to do so in 2010 as necessary to improve our billing and collection performance. However, as we implement these system upgrades, our collection performance as well as our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment could be negatively impacted. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date based upon our actual historical collection experience. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was approximately $340, $334 and $334 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2009, the increase in our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was primarily due to a 1% increase in the Medicare composite rate, an increase in our commercial payment rates, an increase in our reimbursement rates for EPO and other pharmaceuticals and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by changes in the mix of our commercial payors. In 2008, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was flat as compared to 2007, but was impacted by some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, a decrease in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals offset by changes in mix and rates of some of our other commercial payors. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, including the bundling of such services, and changes in the mix of government and commercial payors may materially impact our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in the future. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals and business infrastructure, including the operating costs of our dialysis centers, and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost variability, such as employee benefit costs and insurance costs. Our average clinical hours per treatment have remained relatively stable over the past few years primarily because of improved efficiencies driven by reduced clinical teammate turnover and improved training and processes. In 2009, we were able to reduce our average clinical hours per treatment from 2008 as a result of continued productivity improvements primarily through reduced teammate turnover and the fact that 2008 was negatively impacted by the implementation of new federal guidelines. We continue to strive for improved productivity levels, however we may not be able to sustain our 2009 performance as changes in federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels, as would improvements in the U.S. economy, which could stimulate additional competition for skilled clinical personnel, and result in higher teammate turnover. In 2009 and 2008, we also experienced an increase in our labor rates of approximately 2.5% and 3.5%, respectively, as labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. In 2009, we experienced an increase in our pharmaceutical costs, mainly related to EPO, which increased by approximately 2%. In addition, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO provides for specific rebates based on a combination of factors, including process improvement and data submission, which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to continue to qualify for these rebates. In 2009, we experienced increases in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new centers opened, and general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. 41 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of consolidated revenues over the past three years. However, this reflects a substantial increase in the dollar amount of spending related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal matters and supporting the growth in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. We expect that the level of general and administrative expenses will be sustained and may vary depending upon the level of investment we make in our long term initiatives, including further investments in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and to support our regulatory compliance efforts. Outlook for 2010. Currently, we still expect our operating income for 2010 to be in the range of $950 million to $1,020 million and we also expect our operating cash flows for 2010 to be in the range of $675 million to $725 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks and uncertainties, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates or changes to the structure of payments under the Medicare ESRD program or other government based programs, including, for example, the implementation of a bundled payment rate system which will lower reimbursement for services we provide to Medicare patients, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the cautionary language contained in the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 38 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. Results of operations We operate principally as a dialysis and related lab services business but also operate other ancillary services and strategic initiatives. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services (VillageHealth), vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs and physician services. The dialysis and related lab services business qualifies as a separately reportable segment and all of the other ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been combined and disclosed in the other segments category. Following is a summary of consolidated operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. Year ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 6,109 100 % $ 5,660 100 % $ 5,264 100 % Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 4,249 70 % 3,920 69 % 3,590 68 % General and administrative 532 9 % 508 9 % 491 9 % Depreciation and amortization 229 4 % 217 4 % 193 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 162 3 % 146 3 % 137 3 % Equity investment income (2 ) (1 ) (1 ) Valuation gain on alliance and product supply agreement (55 ) (1 )% Total operating expenses and charges 5,169 85 % 4,791 85 % 4,355 83 % Operating income $ 940 15 % $ 869 15 % $ 909 17 % 42 Table of Contents The following table summarizes consolidated net operating revenues: Year ended 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 5,792 $ 5,415 $ 5,130 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives 317 245 134 Consolidated net operating revenues $ 6,109 $ 5,660 $ 5,264 The following table summarizes consolidated operating income: Year ended 2009 2008(2) 2007(1)(2) (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 1,000 $ 939 $ 990 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives loss (18 ) (30 ) (48 ) Total segment operating income 982 910 942 Reconciling items: Stock based compensation (44 ) (41 ) (34 ) Equity investment income 2 1 1 Consolidated operating income 940 869 909 Reconciliation of non GAAP measures: Less: Gains on insurance settlements (7 ) Valuation gain on the alliance and product supply agreement (55 ) Non GAAP consolidated operating income $ 940 $ 869 $ 847 (1) In 2007, we have excluded valuation gains on the alliance and product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products Inc. (the Product Supply Agreement) as well as gains on insurance settlements from Hurricane Katrina from non GAAP adjusted consolidated operating income in 2007 because management believes that this presentation enhances a users understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding a non recurring non cash gain that resulted from the termination of our purchase obligation for dialysis machines from Gambro Renal Products Inc. under the Product Supply Agreement as well as an unusual insurance gain, and as a result is both more meaningful and comparable to our current and prior period results, and more indicative of our normal consolidated operating income. (2) Certain costs previously reported in ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been reclassified to dialysis and related lab services to conform to the current year presentation. Consolidated net operating revenues Consolidated net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $449 million or approximately 7.9% from 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $377 million, principally due to increased treatments, and an increase of approximately $72 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues primarily from growth in our pharmacy services, VillageHealth services and from our infusion therapy services. Consolidated net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $396 million or approximately 7.5% from 2007. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $285 million, principally due to increased treatments, and an increase of approximately $111 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues primarily from growth in our pharmacy services, VillageHealth services and from our infusion therapy services. 43 Table of Contents Consolidated operating income Consolidated operating income of $940 million for 2009 increased by approximately $71 million from 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue as a result of non acquired treatment growth in dialysis and related lab services, as well as an increase in our dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6 as described below. Operating income also increased as a result of cost control initiatives, improved productivity and lower operating losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, which losses were reduced by approximately $12 million in 2009, partially offset by the negative impact of higher pharmaceutical, labor and benefit costs, and increases in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Consolidated operating income was $869 million for 2008, as compared to $909 million for 2007. Consolidated operating income in 2007 included a valuation gain of $55 million on the Product Supply Agreement and the $7 million insurance settlement related to Hurricane Katrina. Excluding the valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement and the insurance settlement in 2007, our consolidated operating income for 2008 would have increased by approximately $22 million, compared to the adjusted operating income for 2007. This increase in consolidated operating income for 2008 as compared to adjusted operating income for 2007 was primarily due to treatment growth in dialysis and related lab services revenues, combined with growth in revenue in ancillary services and strategic initiatives outpacing increases in our operating expenses. Our ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating losses were reduced by approximately $18 million in 2008. However, our consolidated operating income for 2008 was negatively affected by rising labor costs, the absence of a Medicare rate increase, the impact of some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, decreases in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, an increase in the operating costs of our dialysis centers, driven in part by the number of new dialysis centers opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, an increase in pharmaceutical costs (primarily heparin) and an increase in stock based compensation costs. Operating segments Dialysis and Related Lab Services Year ended 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, exceptper treatment data) Revenues $ 5,792 $ 5,415 $ 5,130 Segment operating income $ 1,000 $ 939 $ 990 Dialysis treatments 17,010,450 16,217,107 15,318,995 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 54,433 51,663 48,942 Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment $ 340 $ 334 $ 334 Net operating revenues Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $377 million or approximately 6.9% from 2008. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 4.7%, and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6, or 1.9%. The increase in the number of treatments was primarily due to an increase in non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. The increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2009, as compared to 2008, was primarily due to a 1% Medicare increase in the Medicare composite rate, an increase in our commercial payment rates, an increase in our reimbursement rates for EPO and other pharmaceuticals, and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by changes in the mix of our commercial payors. Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $285 million or approximately 5.6% from 2007. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the 44 Table of Contents number of treatments of approximately 5.7%, offset by a slight decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment. The increase in number of treatments was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatment days in 2008, as compared to 2007, and non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. The decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily due to the impact of some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, decreases in intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by changes in the mix and rates of some of our other commercial payors. The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues by modality for the year ended December 31, 2009: Revenuepercentages Outpatient hemodialysis centers 84 % Peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis 11 % Hospital inpatient hemodialysis 5 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % In addition to reimbursements for dialysis treatments, the other major component of dialysis and related lab services revenues is the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents slightly more than 30% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009. Approximately 65% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare assigned plans, representing approximately 88% of our total patients. Approximately 35% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues and 12% of our patients are associated with commercial payors. Less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services payments are due directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 5% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009. On average we are paid significantly more for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans than we are for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other government plans such as Medicare assigned plans. Patients covered by commercial health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. As of December 31, 2009, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $150 and $167 per treatment, or an overall average of $159 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Nearly all of our net earnings from dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates as established by contract and others of which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. We are continuously in negotiations with commercial payors for contracted rates and some of these payment rates are under downward pressure as we negotiate these rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers and we expect this trend to continue. We also expect that we may experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. In addition, payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations on non contracted or out of network providers, in which we receive higher payment rates than for in network providers. If we experience a net overall reduction in our contracted and non contracted commercial rates as a result of these negotiations or restrictions, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors, including our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted and non contracted 45 Table of Contents commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, including the bundling of such services and changes in the mix of government and non government payments. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and operating costs of the dialysis centers. The dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $234, $230 and $227 for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The $4 increase in the per treatment costs in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to higher labor rates and benefit costs, an increase in pharmaceutical costs, an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers and a increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by improved productivity. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis increased by approximately $3 in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in the per treatment costs was primarily attributable to an increase in labor rates as well as the negative impact on productivity during the year as we implemented new federal guidelines. Additionally, we experienced an increase in the operating costs of our dialysis centers driven in part by the number of new centers opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, and an increase in pharmaceutical costs, partially offset by a decrease in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. General and administrative expenses. Dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses for the years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $427 million, $402 million and $400 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $25 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to increases in labor and benefit costs, partially offset by the timing of certain other expenditures. The increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $2 million in 2008 as compared to 2007, was primarily due to increases in labor costs and the timing of certain other expenditures, mainly offset by lower integration costs and lower professional fees. Depreciation and amortization. Dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $222 million, $210 million and $189 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $12 million in depreciation and amortization for dialysis and related lab services in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to growth through new center developments and expansions. The increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $21 million in 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily due to growth through new center developments and expansions and a change in amortization associated with amendments to the Product Supply Agreement. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for dialysis and related lab services was 2.7% for 2009 and 2.6% for 2008 and 2007. The increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts in 2009 was primarily to reflect a slowdown in the timing of payments from some of our non government payors. The current provision level of 2.7% may increase if we encounter problems with our billing and collection process as a result of sustained weakness in the U.S. economy. Operating income Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2009 increased by approximately $61 million as compared to 2008. The increase in the operating income for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to growth in the number of dialysis treatments, an increase in the dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6 as described above. The dialysis and related lab services operating income also increased as a result of certain cost control initiatives and improved productivity, but was negatively impacted primarily by higher labor and benefit costs, an increase in pharmaceutical costs and an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. 46 Table of Contents Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2008 decreased by approximately $51 million as compared to 2007. Operating income in 2007 included a valuation gain of $55 million on the Product Supply Agreement and $7 million of insurance settlements relating to Hurricane Katrina as discussed above. Excluding these items, operating income for 2008 would have increased by approximately $11 million as compared to adjusted operating income for 2007. The increase in the operating income for 2008 as compared to adjusted operating income for 2007 was primarily due to growth in the volume of revenue outpacing increases in certain expenditures. However, operating income for 2008 was negatively affected by certain significant items such as a decrease in our dialysis revenue per treatment, lower intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, an increase in labor costs and higher operating costs of our dialysis centers primarily associated with the number of new centers that were opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, an increase in pharmaceutical costs (primarily heparin), and the absence of a Medicare rate increase. Other Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Year ended 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Revenues $ 317 $ 245 $ 134 Segment operating loss $ (18 ) $ (30 ) $ (48 ) Net operating revenues The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $72 million or 29.5% as compared to 2008, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, VillageHealth services and from our infusion therapy services. The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $111 million or 82.7% as compared to 2007, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, VillageHealth services, vascular access services and a full year of operations of our infusion therapy services which we acquired in the third quarter of 2007. Operating expenses Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2009 increased by approximately $60 million from 2008, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business, an increase in labor and benefit costs, partially offset by lower professional fees. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2008 increased by approximately $93 million from 2007, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business, an increase in fixed operating expenses, an increase in labor costs and a full year of operations of our infusion therapy services, partially offset by lower professional fees in our VillageHealth business. Operating loss Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2009 decreased by approximately $12 million from 2008. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to volume growth in revenues outpacing increases in operating expenses, primarily associated with our pharmacy business and our VillageHealth business, partially offset by an increase in operating losses associated with certain new initiatives. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2008 decreased by approximately $18 million from 2007. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to growth in revenues outpacing increases in operating expenses, primarily associated with our pharmacy business and our vascular access services. 47 Table of Contents Corporate level charges Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation of approximately $44 million for 2009 increased by approximately $3 million from 2008. Stock based compensation for 2008 increased by approximately $7 million from 2007. The increases in both periods resulted from an increase in the aggregate quantity of grants that contributed expense to each of these years. Debt expense. Debt expense for 2009, 2008, and 2007 consisted of interest expense of approximately $176 million, $215 million, and $243 million, respectively, and amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $10 million for each year presented. Debt expense for 2007 also included the write off of approximately $4 million of deferred financing costs associated with the principal prepayments on our term loans. The decrease in interest expense in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt and the result of lower notional amounts of fixed rate swap agreements that contained higher rates. As of December 31, 2009, the notional amounts of our fixed rate swaps were approximately $389 million as compared to approximately $790 million at December 31, 2008. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2009 was 4.86% as compared to 5.82% in 2008. The decrease in interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Our overall weighted average interest rate in 2008 was 5.82% as compared to 6.49% in 2007. Equity investment income. Equity investment income was approximately $2.4 million in 2009 as compared to $0.8 million in 2008. The increase in equity investment income in 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the number of equity investments and improved profitability at several joint ventures. Equity investment income in 2008 remained flat as compared to 2007. Other income. Other income was approximately $4 million, $12 million, and $22 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, and consisted principally of interest income. The decrease in other income in 2009 was primarily the result of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash balances. The decrease in other income in 2008 as compared to 2007, was primarily due to the fact that 2007 included gains on the sale of investments of approximately $6 million resulting from the sale of our investment in NxStage Medical Inc. and a decrease in interest rates as well as lower average cash and investment balances. Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for 2009 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 36.7%, compared with 35.9% and 36.4% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2008 was lower primarily due to nonrecurring tax benefits associated with transactions occurring in 2008. We currently project the effective income tax rate for 2010 to be in the range of 36.5% to 37.5%. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, and our investments in ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that an impairment review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. These types of adjustments are charged directly to the corresponding operating segment that incurred the charge. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. Noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $57 million, $47 million and $47 million, respectively. The increase in noncontrolling interests in 2009 was primarily due to an increase in new dialysis centers having minority partners and growth in the earnings of our existing dialysis joint ventures. The percentage of dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues generated from dialysis related joint ventures was approximately 16% in 2009 compared to 15% in 2008. 48 Table of Contents Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2009 and 2008 represented approximately 68 and 70 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt allowance. The relative decrease in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2009 was a result of improved cash collections on current outstanding balances. Accounts receivable balances of approximately 70 days of revenue is more consistent with our past experience levels and expected trends. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately $201 million and $102 million in unreserved accounts receivable, respectively, representing approximately 18% and 9% of our total accounts receivable balance, respectively, were more than six months old. During 2009, we experienced delays in cash collections from certain government payors and certain commercial payors. We anticipate that we will collect these outstanding balances since we believe the delays in collections relate primarily to the timing of payors processing our claims for payment. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than 2% of our treatments are classified as patient pay. Substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $46 million and $39 million, respectively, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Currently, our Medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. However, the payment received from Medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. Such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements, except for potentially limiting the collectibility of these Medicare bad debt claims. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2009, our cash balance was $539 million and we had undrawn credit under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $250 million, of which approximately $52 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2009 amounted to $667 million, compared with $614 million for 2008. Cash flow from operations in 2009 included cash interest payments of approximately $186 million and cash tax payments of $162 million. Cash flow from operations in 2008 included cash interest payments of $223 million and cash tax payments of $163 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2009 included $275 million for capital asset expenditures, including $161 million for new center developments and relocations, and $114 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $88 million for acquisitions. During 2009, we also received $33 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, we received $75 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $68 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $13 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 2.9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $154 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2008 included $318 million for capital asset expenditures, including $213 million for new center developments and relocations and $105 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $102 million for acquisitions. During 2008, we also received $43 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, we received 49 Table of Contents $48 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $59 million and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $19 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 4.8 million shares of our common stock for approximately $233 million. During 2009, we acquired a total of 19 dialysis centers, opened 78 new dialysis centers, sold or closed eight centers, merged 16 centers into other existing centers, made equity investments in six centers and added two centers under management and administrative service agreements. During 2008, we acquired a total of 20 dialysis centers, opened 86 new dialysis centers, sold or closed nine centers, merged eight centers into other existing centers, ceased operations at one joint venture in which we owned an equity investment and added a net two centers under management and administrative service agreements. We currently expect to spend approximately $125 million for general maintenance capital asset expenditures in 2010, and approximately $250 million for new center development, relocations and center acquisitions depending upon the availability of certain projects and sufficient project returns which does not include any potential expenditures for our new corporate headquarters. We expect to generate approximately $675 million to $725 million of operating cash flow in 2010. Our actual expenditures for growth and cash flows in 2010 could vary significantly from these expected amounts. 2009 capital structure changes and other items Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain customary affirmative and negative covenants and require compliance with financial covenants, including an interest rate coverage ratio and a leverage ratio that determines the interest rate margins on our term loan A and our revolving line of credit. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities in general also contain limits on the general amount of capital expenditures for internal growth, acquisitions and capital improvements, as described below, as well as limits on the amount of tangible net assets in non guarantor subsidiaries. Term Loan A During 2009, we made mandatory principal payments totaling $61.3 million on our term loan A. As a result of these principal payments, the outstanding balance on term loan A as of December 31, 2009 was $153.1 million and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall weighted average effective rate of 1.74%. The interest rate margin is subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term loan A matures in October 2011 and requires annual principal payments of $87.5 million in 2010 and $65.6 million in 2011, respectively. Term Loan B As of December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance of our term loan B was $1.7 billion and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% for an overall weighted average effective rate of 2.66%, including the impact of our swap agreements. We did not make any principal payments on term loan B during 2009, nor were we required to. Term loan B matures in October 2012 and requires principal payments of $1.7 billion in 2012. Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes Our senior and senior subordinated notes, as of December 31, 2009, consisted of $900 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments in March and September. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. 50 Table of Contents Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2009, we maintained a total of eight interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $389 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.88% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.78% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2009, 2008, and 2007 we accrued net cash (obligations) benefits of approximately ($17.3) million, $(4.2) million, and $14.5 million, respectively, from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. We estimate that approximately $8.9 million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2009 will be reclassified into income in 2010. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the total fair value of these swaps were liabilities of $10.8 million and $21.9 million, respectively. The 2009 amount was included in other current liabilities. The 2008 amount was primarily included in other long term liabilities. Also during 2009, we recorded approximately $8.0 million, net of tax, as an increase to other comprehensive income for amounts reclassified into income, net of swap valuation losses. In 2008, we recorded $10.4 million, net of tax, as reductions to other comprehensive income for swap valuation losses, net of amounts reclassified into income. As of December 31, 2009, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 21% of our variable rate debt and approximately 59% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements, our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 2.63%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, as of December 31, 2009. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2009 was 4.86% and as of December 31, 2009 was 4.68%. Stock repurchases During 2009, we repurchased a total of 2,902,619 shares of our common stock for $153.5 million, or an average price of $52.88 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. On November 3, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an increase of an additional $500 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2009 was $500 million. We have not repurchased any additional shares of our common stock from January 1, 2010 through February 25, 2010. This stock repurchase program has no expiration date. Stock based compensation Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in all prior periods. During 2009, we granted 4,211,840 stock settled stock appreciation rights with a grant date fair value of $50.9 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 3.5 years, and also granted 48,135 stock units with a grant date fair value of $2.6 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 2.5 years. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recognized $44.4 million and $41.2 million, respectively, in stock based compensation expense for stock options, stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock units and discounted employee stock plan purchases, which is primarily included in general and 51 Table of Contents administrative expenses. The estimated tax benefits recorded for this stock based compensation in 2009 and 2008 were $16.8 million and $15.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, there was $80.0 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we received $63.7 million and $35.6 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $18.2 million and $14.0 million, respectively, in total actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. 2008 capital structure changes Term Loan A During 2008, we made mandatory principal payments totaling $14.9 million on our term loan A. As a result of these principal payments, the outstanding balance on term loan A as of December 31, 2008 was $214.4 million and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall weighted average effective rate of 1.97%. The interest rate margin is subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term Loan B As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance of our term loan B was $1.7 billion and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% for an overall weighted average effective rate of 3.63%, including the impact of our swap agreements. We did not make any principal payments on term loan B during 2008, nor were we required to. Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes Our senior and senior subordinated notes, as of December 31, 2008, consisted of $900 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments in March and September. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. Stock repurchases During 2008, we repurchased a total of 4,788,881 shares of our common stock for $232.7 million, or an average price of $48.59 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. On May 1, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of an additional $143.5 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2008 was $153.5 million. This stock repurchase program had no expiration date. Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2008, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $790 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.54%, on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. As of December 31, 2008, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 41% of our variable rate debt and approximately 69% of our total debt. 52 Table of Contents As a result of the swap agreements our overall weighted average effective interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 3.48%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 our overall weighted average effective interest rate was 5.10%. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases and letters of credit as well as potential obligations associated with our equity investments and to dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several joint ventures and for some of our non wholly owned subsidiaries in the form of put provisions. These put provisions, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners noncontrolling interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the noncontrolling interests put to us, which is intended to approximate fair value. The methodology we use to estimate the fair value of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions assumes either the higher of a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings, based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. The estimate of the fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions is a critical accounting estimate that involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners noncontrolling interests. The amount of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions that contractually employ a predetermined multiple of earnings rather than fair value are immaterial. For additional information see Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several other dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties or centers in which we own an equity investment, as well as to physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under management and administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2009 (in millions): Less Than1 year 2 3years 4 5years After5 years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 100 $ 1,774 $ 901 $ 850 $ 3,625 Interest payments on senior and senior subordinated notes 121 243 153 31 548 Capital lease obligations 2 1 2 5 Operating leases 216 374 283 439 1,312 $ 437 $ 2,393 $ 1,338 $ 1,322 $ 5,490 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 52 $ $ $ $ 52 Noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions 169 56 52 55 332 Pay fixed swaps potential obligations 11 11 Operating capital advances 7 7 Income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 19 19 $ 258 $ 56 $ 52 $ 55 $ 421 53 Table of Contents Not included above are interest payments related to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2009 bear interest at LIBOR plus current margins of 1.50%. The term loan A and the revolving line of credit are adjustable depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2009, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities had an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 2.63%, including the effects of our swap agreements. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific debt tranches within each term loan, which can range in maturity from one month to twelve months. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of mandatory principal payments and principal prepayments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no principal prepayments on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities during 2010 and no changes in the effective interest rate, including the interest rate margin, approximately $49 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2010. The pay fixed swap obligations represent the estimated fair market values of our interest rate swap agreements as reported by various broker dealers that are based upon relevant observable market inputs as well as other current market conditions that existed as of December 31, 2009, and represent the estimated potential obligation that we would be required to pay based upon the estimated future settlement of each specific tranche within the swap agreements. The actual amount of our obligation associated with these swaps in the future will depend upon changes in the LIBOR based interest rates that can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions, and other relevant factors that can affect the fair market value of these swap agreements. In addition to the above commitments, we are obligated to purchase a certain amount of our hemodialysis products and supplies at fixed prices through 2015 from Gambro Renal Products, Inc. in connection with the Product Supply Agreement. Our total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs in each year. In January 2010, we entered into an agreement with Fresenius which committed us to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies from them through 2013. The actual amount of purchases in future years from Gambro Renal Products and Fresenius will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, and in the case of the Product Supply Agreement, Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. Settlements of approximately $15 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made. Contingencies The information in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly 54 Table of Contents variable compensation accruals, purchase accounting valuation estimates, fair value estimates and stock based compensation are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, slow down in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 118,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as 6% of consolidated operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairments of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers or other operations. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the 55 Table of Contents expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year, and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. We are required to assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and to also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain and future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. We make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets, liabilities and contractual as well as non contractual contingencies associated with our acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Long lived tangible and intangible assets are subject to our regular ongoing impairment assessments. Fair value estimates. We have recorded certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions at fair value. The FASB defines fair value which is measured based upon certain valuation techniques that include inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. We have measured the fair values of our applicable assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions based upon certain market inputs and assumptions that are either observable or unobservable in determining fair values and have also classified these assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels. The fair value of our investments available for sale are based upon quoted market prices from active markets and the fair value of our swap agreements are based upon valuation models and a variety of techniques as reported by various broker dealers that are based upon relevant observable market inputs such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, and other credit and liquidity market conditions. For our noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions we have estimated the fair values of these based upon either the higher of a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. The estimate of the fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners noncontrolling interests. 56 Table of Contents Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 include compensation costs for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of December 31, 2006, and stock based awards granted thereafter. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk free interest rates. Significant new accounting standards On June 29, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the single source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for all nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are also sources of authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification does not change U.S. GAAP but takes previously issued FASB standards and other U.S. GAAP authoritative pronouncements, changes the way the standards are referred to, and includes them in specific topic areas. The Codification is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of the Codification did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. Effective for our first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, the FASB is eliminating the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and requiring additional disclosures about an enterprises involvement in variable interest entities. An enterprise will be required to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity by having both the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity, or the right to receive benefits from the entity. In addition, the FASB is establishing new guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity, requiring an ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and adding an additional reconsideration event for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity when any changes in facts and circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk, as a group, lose the power from voting rights or similar rights concerning those investments to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. We are currently in the process of assessing the expected impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. Effective May 28, 2009, the FASB issued requirements relating to the accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. These requirements set forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. These requirements do not apply to subsequent events or transactions that are within the scope of other applicable principles of GAAP that provide different guidance on the accounting treatment for subsequent events or transactions. These requirements were effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. Effective January 1, 2009, we are required to provide enhanced disclosures about our derivative and hedging activities. We are required to provide additional disclosures about (a) how and why we use derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. These requirements did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for the disclosure of these items. 57 Table of Contents Effective January 1, 2009, we are required to treat noncontrolling interests as a separate component of equity, but apart from our equity, and not as a liability or other item outside of equity. We are also required to identify and present consolidated net income attributable to us and to noncontrolling interests on the face of the consolidated statement of income. Previously, we had reported minority interests (noncontrolling interests) as a reduction to operating income. In addition, changes in our ownership interest while we retain a controlling financial interest should be accounted for as equity transactions. We were also required to expand disclosures in the financial statements to include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the equity attributable to us and the noncontrolling owners and a schedule showing the effects of changes in our ownership interest in a subsidiary on the equity attributable to us. This change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements; however, it did change the presentation of minority interests (noncontrolling interests) in our consolidated financial statements. In conjunction with adopting these requirements, we are required to classify securities with redemption features that are not solely within our control such as our noncontrolling interests that are subject to put provisions outside of permanent equity and to measure these noncontrolling interests at fair value. See Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for further details. The consolidated financial statements have been recast for all prior periods presented for the retrospective application of these presentation and disclosure requirements. All business combinations consummated after January 1, 2009, are required to be accounted for under the acquisition method (previously referred to as the purchase method). Under the acquisition method, the acquirer recognizes the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, as well as any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date. Noncontractual contingencies are recognized at the acquisition date at their fair values only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability. Transaction costs are excluded from the acquisition cost and are expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration included by the acquirer as part of the purchase price must also be measured at fair value at the acquisition date and is classified as either equity or a liability. A company that obtains control but acquires less than 100% of an acquiree is required to record 100% of the fair value of the acquiree assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests at the acquisition date. The adoption of these requirements did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2008, the FASB required public entities to provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets and required public enterprises to provide additional disclosures about their involvement in variable interest entities and certain special purpose entities. Because these requirements impact disclosures and not the accounting treatment for transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities, these requirements did not impact our financial condition or results of operations. Effective January 1, 2008, the FASB established a framework for measuring fair value and also required additional disclosures about fair value measurements. These requirements applied to assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. Effective January 1, 2009 the FASB issued additional requirements relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). See note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for the impact of these requirements. The adoption of these requirements relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Effective January 1, 2008, the FASB allows companies the alternative to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis that are currently not required to be measured at fair value. This provision is also designed to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The adoption of this provision did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 58 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2009. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average LIBOR rates in effect for all debt tranches plus margins in effect at the end of 2009 including the economic effects of our swap agreements. Term loan A and revolving line of credit interest rate margins are subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio. The margins currently in effect at December 31, 2009 were 1.50% on all of the outstanding balances under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. For our interest rate swap agreements, the table below presents the notional amounts by contract maturity date and the related interest rate terms of the agreements (to pay fixed rates, and to receive LIBOR). Expected maturity date Total FairValue Averageinterestrate 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 2 $ 1 $ 1 $ 901 $ 1 $ 852 $ 1,758 $ 1,765 6.88 % Variable rate $ 98 $ 67 $ 1,707 $ $ $ $ 1,872 $ 1,829 2.62 % Notionalamount Contract maturity date Payfixed Receivevariable Fairvalue 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 (dollars in millions) Swaps: Pay fixed swaps $ 389 $ 389 $ $ $ $ 3.88% to 4.70% LIBOR $ (10.8 ) Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which include the term loan A and the term loan B, consist of various individual tranches that can range in maturity from one month to twelve months and each specific tranche bears interest at a LIBOR rate that is determined by the maturity of that specific tranche plus an interest rate margin, which is currently 1.50% at December 31, 2009. LIBOR based interest rates are reset as each specific tranche matures and a new tranche is re established and can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions including the credit and capital markets. Any increase in the LIBOR based interest rates on the unhedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2009 will have a negative impact on our overall earnings. As of December 31, 2009, we maintained a total of eight interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $389 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.88% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.78% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2009, we accrued net cash obligations of $17.3 million from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2009, the total fair value of these swaps was a liability of $10.8 million. During 2009, we recorded $8.0 million, net of tax, as an increase to other comprehensive income for amounts reclassified into income, net of swap valuation losses. As of December 31, 2009, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 21% of our variable rate debt and approximately 59% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements, our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 2.63%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50% as of December 31, 2009. 59 Table of Contents Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2009 was 4.86% and as of December 31, 2009 was 4.68%. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $8.5 million, $7.1 million, and $5.5 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this report. The following table presents selected consolidated financial and operating data for the periods indicated. Effective January 1, 2009, we were required to present consolidated net income attributable to us and to noncontrolling interests on the face of the consolidated statement of income, which changed the presentation of minority interests (noncontrolling interests) in our consolidated statements of income. These consolidated financial results have been recast for all prior periods presented to reflect the retrospective application of adopting these new presentation and disclosure requirements for noncontrolling interests. The operating results of DVA Renal Healthcare are included in our operating results from October 1, 2005, and the operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income for 2005.

Operating expenses and charges in 2007 also includes $6,779 of gains from insurance settlements related to Hurricane Katrina and a fire that destroyed one center. (3) Debt expense in 2007 and 2006 includes the write off of approximately $4.4 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of deferred financing costs associated with our principal prepayments on our term loans. (4) The swap valuation net gains of $4,548 in 2005 represented the accumulated fair value on several swap instruments that were ineffective as cash flow hedges, as a result of the repayment of our prior senior secured credit facilities, as well as changes in the fair values of these swaps until they were redesignated as hedges, and represent changes in the fair value of the swaps during periods in which there was no matching variable rate LIBOR based interest payments. (5) Refinancing charges of $8,170 in 2005 represented the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the extinguishment of our prior senior secured credit facilities. (6) Other income, net, includes $5,868 in 2007 of gains from the sale of investment securities. (7) During 2005, we divested a total of 71 outpatient dialysis centers in conjunction with a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission on October 4, 2005 in order for us to complete the acquisition of DVA Renal Healthcare. In addition, we completed the sale of three additional centers that were previously pending state regulatory approval in January 2006. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested and held for sale centers were reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for 2005. (8) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests includes $1,747 in 2006, and $1,219 in 2005 of income from discontinued operations. (9) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed by dividing earnings by fixed charges. Earnings for this purpose is defined as pretax income from continuing operations adjusted by adding back fixed charges expensed during the period. Fixed charges include debt expense (interest expense and the write off and amortization of deferred financing costs), the estimated interest component of rental expense on operating leases, and capitalized interest. (10) Share repurchases consisted of 2,902,619 shares of common stock for $153,495 in 2009, 4,788,881 shares of common stock for $232,715 in 2008 and 111,300 shares of common stock for $6,350 in 2007. Shares issued in connection with stock awards amounted to 2,104,304 in 2009, 1,314,074 in 2008, 2,480,899 in 2007, 2,620,125 in 2006 and 3,303,451 in 2005. 37 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,530 outpatient dialysis centers and approximately 720 hospitals, serving approximately 118,000 patients in 43 states. In 2009, our overall network of dialysis centers increased by 81 centers primarily as a result of opening new centers and acquisitions and the overall number of patients that we serve increased by approximately 5.5%. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three stakeholders our patients, our business partners, and our teammates represents the major driver of our long term performance, although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes as measured by DQI have improved over each of the past three years. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. In addition, over the past several years our teammate turnover has remained relatively constant, although in 2009 we did experience a decrease in our overall teammate turnover. We believe this was a major contributor to our continued clinical performance improvements and also a major driver in our ability to improve productivity in 2009. We will continue to focus on these stakeholders and our clinical outcomes as we believe these are fundamental long term value drivers. 38 Table of Contents Approximately 95% of our 2009 consolidated net operating revenues were derived directly from our dialysis and related lab services business. Approximately 84% of our 2009 dialysis and related lab services revenues were derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in the 1,498 centers that we consolidate, which are either wholly owned or majority owned. Other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services. These services collectively accounted for the balance of our 2009 dialysis and related lab services revenues. We also generate management fees from management and administrative services to certain third party owned dialysis centers and dialysis centers that we own an equity investment in. These management fees represent less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. Our other business operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. These consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs and physician services. These services generated approximately $317 million of net operating revenues in 2009, or approximately 5% of our consolidated net operating revenues. Overall our ancillary services and strategic initiatives decreased their operating losses from $30 million in 2008 to $18 million in 2009, primarily as a result of improved profitability in our pharmacy and disease management businesses. We currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives as we work to develop successful new business operations. However, any significant change in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes could result in a write off or an impairment of some or all of our investments, including goodwill, in these strategic initiatives, or could also result in significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are: the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week, as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services; average dialysis revenue per treatment; and the number of laboratory patient tests. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, which we believe is influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our ability to open and acquire new centers. Our year over year treatment volume growth was 4.9% in 2009. Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment is primarily driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, and our billing and collecting operations performance. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are significantly higher than Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis revenue per treatment. The percentage of commercial patients covered under contracted plans as compared to commercial patients with out of network providers can also significantly affect our average dialysis revenue per treatment. In 2009, the growth of our government based patients, driven primarily by growth in Medicare assigned plans, which we believe is largely as a result of improved mortality and the current economic recession, outpaced the growth in our commercial patients, which negatively impacted our average dialysis revenue per treatment as a result of receiving lower payment rates associated with these additional government based patients. 39 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009: Revenues Medicare and Medicare assigned plans 57 % Medicaid and Medicaid assigned plans 6 % Other government based programs 2 % Total government based programs 65 % Commercial (including hospital dialysis services) 35 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Government payment rates are principally determined by federal Medicare and state Medicaid policy. These payment rates have historically had limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reduction as federal and state governments face increasing budget pressures. Medicare payment rates for dialysis services through 2008 have not been routinely increased to compensate for the impact of inflation. In July 2008, MIPPA was passed by Congress which introduced a new payment system for dialysis services beginning in January 2011 whereby ESRD payments will be made under a bundled payment rate which will provide for a fixed rate for all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment. The legislation also provided for an increase in the composite rate of 1% effective January 1, 2009 and an additional 1% effective January 1, 2010. On September 15, 2009, CMS released the proposed rule regarding the new bundled payment rate system. The initial 2011 bundled rate is required to be set based on a 2% reduction in the payment rate that providers would have received under the historical fee for service payment methodology and based on the lowest average industry pharmaceutical utilization from 2007 to 2009. The combined effect of the adjustments provided in the proposed rule would result in a bundled rate that represents a significantly greater than 2% reduction in the payment rate that we would have received for our services prior to bundling. The proposed rule also requires, among other things, the new single bundled payment base rate to be adjusted annually for inflation based upon a market basket index, less 1% of such index, beginning in 2012. Dialysis providers have the option to move fully to the bundled payment system in 2011 or to phase in the payment system over three years. Dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with large payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. In 2009, we were successful in maintaining and in some instances increasing average payment rates, resulting in an aggregate increase in average payment rates for patients with commercial plans. However, we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors and payors are aggressive in their negotiations. If our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, this would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, if there are sustained or increased job losses in the United States as a result of current economic conditions, or depending upon changes to the healthcare regulatory system, we could experience a decrease in the number of patients under commercial plans. We also expect that some of our contracted rates with commercial payors may decrease or we may experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. In addition, payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations on non contracted or out of network providers, which could further decrease our commercial rate revenues since rates for out of network providers are on average higher than rates for in network providers. Approximately 30% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were from physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for approximately 20% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. Therefore, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in commercial and governmental payment rates for EPO significantly influence our revenue. For example, effective January 2008, changes to the EPO monitoring policy went into effect which further limited reimbursements and impacted the prescribing habits of our physicians, which 40 Table of Contents resulted in lower pharmaceutical intensities during 2008. In 2009, the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals increased slightly from 2008, which helped contribute to an increase in our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past several years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. In 2009, we continued to upgrade our systems and implemented process changes and will continue to do so in 2010 as necessary to improve our billing and collection performance. However, as we implement these system upgrades, our collection performance as well as our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment could be negatively impacted. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date based upon our actual historical collection experience. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was approximately $340, $334 and $334 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2009, the increase in our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was primarily due to a 1% increase in the Medicare composite rate, an increase in our commercial payment rates, an increase in our reimbursement rates for EPO and other pharmaceuticals and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by changes in the mix of our commercial payors. In 2008, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was flat as compared to 2007, but was impacted by some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, a decrease in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals offset by changes in mix and rates of some of our other commercial payors. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, including the bundling of such services, and changes in the mix of government and commercial payors may materially impact our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in the future. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals and business infrastructure, including the operating costs of our dialysis centers, and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost variability, such as employee benefit costs and insurance costs. Our average clinical hours per treatment have remained relatively stable over the past few years primarily because of improved efficiencies driven by reduced clinical teammate turnover and improved training and processes. In 2009, we were able to reduce our average clinical hours per treatment from 2008 as a result of continued productivity improvements primarily through reduced teammate turnover and the fact that 2008 was negatively impacted by the implementation of new federal guidelines. We continue to strive for improved productivity levels, however we may not be able to sustain our 2009 performance as changes in federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels, as would improvements in the U.S. economy, which could stimulate additional competition for skilled clinical personnel, and result in higher teammate turnover. In 2009 and 2008, we also experienced an increase in our labor rates of approximately 2.5% and 3.5%, respectively, as labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. In 2009, we experienced an increase in our pharmaceutical costs, mainly related to EPO, which increased by approximately 2%. In addition, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO provides for specific rebates based on a combination of factors, including process improvement and data submission, which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to continue to qualify for these rebates. In 2009, we experienced increases in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new centers opened, and general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. 41 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of consolidated revenues over the past three years. However, this reflects a substantial increase in the dollar amount of spending related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal matters and supporting the growth in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. We expect that the level of general and administrative expenses will be sustained and may vary depending upon the level of investment we make in our long term initiatives, including further investments in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and to support our regulatory compliance efforts. Outlook for 2010. Currently, we still expect our operating income for 2010 to be in the range of $950 million to $1,020 million and we also expect our operating cash flows for 2010 to be in the range of $675 million to $725 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks and uncertainties, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates or changes to the structure of payments under the Medicare ESRD program or other government based programs, including, for example, the implementation of a bundled payment rate system which will lower reimbursement for services we provide to Medicare patients, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the cautionary language contained in the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 38 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. Results of operations We operate principally as a dialysis and related lab services business but also operate other ancillary services and strategic initiatives. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services (VillageHealth), vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs and physician services. The dialysis and related lab services business qualifies as a separately reportable segment and all of the other ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been combined and disclosed in the other segments category. Following is a summary of consolidated operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. Year ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 6,109 100 % $ 5,660 100 % $ 5,264 100 % Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 4,249 70 % 3,920 69 % 3,590 68 % General and administrative 532 9 % 508 9 % 491 9 % Depreciation and amortization 229 4 % 217 4 % 193 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 162 3 % 146 3 % 137 3 % Equity investment income (2 ) (1 ) (1 ) Valuation gain on alliance and product supply agreement (55 ) (1 )% Total operating expenses and charges 5,169 85 % 4,791 85 % 4,355 83 % Operating income $ 940 15 % $ 869 15 % $ 909 17 % 42 Table of Contents The following table summarizes consolidated net operating revenues: Year ended 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 5,792 $ 5,415 $ 5,130 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives 317 245 134 Consolidated net operating revenues $ 6,109 $ 5,660 $ 5,264 The following table summarizes consolidated operating income: Year ended 2009 2008(2) 2007(1)(2) (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 1,000 $ 939 $ 990 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives loss (18 ) (30 ) (48 ) Total segment operating income 982 910 942 Reconciling items: Stock based compensation (44 ) (41 ) (34 ) Equity investment income 2 1 1 Consolidated operating income 940 869 909 Reconciliation of non GAAP measures: Less: Gains on insurance settlements (7 ) Valuation gain on the alliance and product supply agreement (55 ) Non GAAP consolidated operating income $ 940 $ 869 $ 847 (1) In 2007, we have excluded valuation gains on the alliance and product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products Inc. (the Product Supply Agreement) as well as gains on insurance settlements from Hurricane Katrina from non GAAP adjusted consolidated operating income in 2007 because management believes that this presentation enhances a users understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding a non recurring non cash gain that resulted from the termination of our purchase obligation for dialysis machines from Gambro Renal Products Inc. under the Product Supply Agreement as well as an unusual insurance gain, and as a result is both more meaningful and comparable to our current and prior period results, and more indicative of our normal consolidated operating income. (2) Certain costs previously reported in ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been reclassified to dialysis and related lab services to conform to the current year presentation. Consolidated net operating revenues Consolidated net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $449 million or approximately 7.9% from 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $377 million, principally due to increased treatments, and an increase of approximately $72 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues primarily from growth in our pharmacy services, VillageHealth services and from our infusion therapy services. Consolidated net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $396 million or approximately 7.5% from 2007. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $285 million, principally due to increased treatments, and an increase of approximately $111 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues primarily from growth in our pharmacy services, VillageHealth services and from our infusion therapy services. 43 Table of Contents Consolidated operating income Consolidated operating income of $940 million for 2009 increased by approximately $71 million from 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue as a result of non acquired treatment growth in dialysis and related lab services, as well as an increase in our dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6 as described below. Operating income also increased as a result of cost control initiatives, improved productivity and lower operating losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, which losses were reduced by approximately $12 million in 2009, partially offset by the negative impact of higher pharmaceutical, labor and benefit costs, and increases in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Consolidated operating income was $869 million for 2008, as compared to $909 million for 2007. Consolidated operating income in 2007 included a valuation gain of $55 million on the Product Supply Agreement and the $7 million insurance settlement related to Hurricane Katrina. Excluding the valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement and the insurance settlement in 2007, our consolidated operating income for 2008 would have increased by approximately $22 million, compared to the adjusted operating income for 2007. This increase in consolidated operating income for 2008 as compared to adjusted operating income for 2007 was primarily due to treatment growth in dialysis and related lab services revenues, combined with growth in revenue in ancillary services and strategic initiatives outpacing increases in our operating expenses. Our ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating losses were reduced by approximately $18 million in 2008. However, our consolidated operating income for 2008 was negatively affected by rising labor costs, the absence of a Medicare rate increase, the impact of some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, decreases in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, an increase in the operating costs of our dialysis centers, driven in part by the number of new dialysis centers opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, an increase in pharmaceutical costs (primarily heparin) and an increase in stock based compensation costs. Operating segments Dialysis and Related Lab Services Year ended 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, exceptper treatment data) Revenues $ 5,792 $ 5,415 $ 5,130 Segment operating income $ 1,000 $ 939 $ 990 Dialysis treatments 17,010,450 16,217,107 15,318,995 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 54,433 51,663 48,942 Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment $ 340 $ 334 $ 334 Net operating revenues Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $377 million or approximately 6.9% from 2008. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 4.7%, and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6, or 1.9%. The increase in the number of treatments was primarily due to an increase in non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. The increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2009, as compared to 2008, was primarily due to a 1% Medicare increase in the Medicare composite rate, an increase in our commercial payment rates, an increase in our reimbursement rates for EPO and other pharmaceuticals, and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by changes in the mix of our commercial payors. Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $285 million or approximately 5.6% from 2007. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the 44 Table of Contents number of treatments of approximately 5.7%, offset by a slight decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment. The increase in number of treatments was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatment days in 2008, as compared to 2007, and non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. The decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily due to the impact of some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, decreases in intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by changes in the mix and rates of some of our other commercial payors. The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues by modality for the year ended December 31, 2009: Revenuepercentages Outpatient hemodialysis centers 84 % Peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis 11 % Hospital inpatient hemodialysis 5 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % In addition to reimbursements for dialysis treatments, the other major component of dialysis and related lab services revenues is the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents slightly more than 30% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009. Approximately 65% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare assigned plans, representing approximately 88% of our total patients. Approximately 35% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues and 12% of our patients are associated with commercial payors. Less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services payments are due directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 5% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009. On average we are paid significantly more for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans than we are for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other government plans such as Medicare assigned plans. Patients covered by commercial health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. As of December 31, 2009, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $150 and $167 per treatment, or an overall average of $159 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Nearly all of our net earnings from dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates as established by contract and others of which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. We are continuously in negotiations with commercial payors for contracted rates and some of these payment rates are under downward pressure as we negotiate these rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers and we expect this trend to continue. We also expect that we may experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. In addition, payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations on non contracted or out of network providers, in which we receive higher payment rates than for in network providers. If we experience a net overall reduction in our contracted and non contracted commercial rates as a result of these negotiations or restrictions, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors, including our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted and non contracted 45 Table of Contents commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, including the bundling of such services and changes in the mix of government and non government payments. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and operating costs of the dialysis centers. The dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $234, $230 and $227 for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The $4 increase in the per treatment costs in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to higher labor rates and benefit costs, an increase in pharmaceutical costs, an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers and a increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by improved productivity. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis increased by approximately $3 in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in the per treatment costs was primarily attributable to an increase in labor rates as well as the negative impact on productivity during the year as we implemented new federal guidelines. Additionally, we experienced an increase in the operating costs of our dialysis centers driven in part by the number of new centers opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, and an increase in pharmaceutical costs, partially offset by a decrease in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. General and administrative expenses. Dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses for the years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $427 million, $402 million and $400 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $25 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to increases in labor and benefit costs, partially offset by the timing of certain other expenditures. The increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $2 million in 2008 as compared to 2007, was primarily due to increases in labor costs and the timing of certain other expenditures, mainly offset by lower integration costs and lower professional fees. Depreciation and amortization. Dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $222 million, $210 million and $189 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $12 million in depreciation and amortization for dialysis and related lab services in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to growth through new center developments and expansions. The increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $21 million in 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily due to growth through new center developments and expansions and a change in amortization associated with amendments to the Product Supply Agreement. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for dialysis and related lab services was 2.7% for 2009 and 2.6% for 2008 and 2007. The increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts in 2009 was primarily to reflect a slowdown in the timing of payments from some of our non government payors. The current provision level of 2.7% may increase if we encounter problems with our billing and collection process as a result of sustained weakness in the U.S. economy. Operating income Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2009 increased by approximately $61 million as compared to 2008. The increase in the operating income for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to growth in the number of dialysis treatments, an increase in the dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6 as described above. The dialysis and related lab services operating income also increased as a result of certain cost control initiatives and improved productivity, but was negatively impacted primarily by higher labor and benefit costs, an increase in pharmaceutical costs and an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. 46 Table of Contents Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2008 decreased by approximately $51 million as compared to 2007. Operating income in 2007 included a valuation gain of $55 million on the Product Supply Agreement and $7 million of insurance settlements relating to Hurricane Katrina as discussed above. Excluding these items, operating income for 2008 would have increased by approximately $11 million as compared to adjusted operating income for 2007. The increase in the operating income for 2008 as compared to adjusted operating income for 2007 was primarily due to growth in the volume of revenue outpacing increases in certain expenditures. However, operating income for 2008 was negatively affected by certain significant items such as a decrease in our dialysis revenue per treatment, lower intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, an increase in labor costs and higher operating costs of our dialysis centers primarily associated with the number of new centers that were opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, an increase in pharmaceutical costs (primarily heparin), and the absence of a Medicare rate increase. Other Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Year ended 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Revenues $ 317 $ 245 $ 134 Segment operating loss $ (18 ) $ (30 ) $ (48 ) Net operating revenues The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $72 million or 29.5% as compared to 2008, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, VillageHealth services and from our infusion therapy services. The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $111 million or 82.7% as compared to 2007, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, VillageHealth services, vascular access services and a full year of operations of our infusion therapy services which we acquired in the third quarter of 2007. Operating expenses Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2009 increased by approximately $60 million from 2008, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business, an increase in labor and benefit costs, partially offset by lower professional fees. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2008 increased by approximately $93 million from 2007, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business, an increase in fixed operating expenses, an increase in labor costs and a full year of operations of our infusion therapy services, partially offset by lower professional fees in our VillageHealth business. Operating loss Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2009 decreased by approximately $12 million from 2008. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to volume growth in revenues outpacing increases in operating expenses, primarily associated with our pharmacy business and our VillageHealth business, partially offset by an increase in operating losses associated with certain new initiatives. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2008 decreased by approximately $18 million from 2007. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to growth in revenues outpacing increases in operating expenses, primarily associated with our pharmacy business and our vascular access services. 47 Table of Contents Corporate level charges Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation of approximately $44 million for 2009 increased by approximately $3 million from 2008. Stock based compensation for 2008 increased by approximately $7 million from 2007. The increases in both periods resulted from an increase in the aggregate quantity of grants that contributed expense to each of these years. Debt expense. Debt expense for 2009, 2008, and 2007 consisted of interest expense of approximately $176 million, $215 million, and $243 million, respectively, and amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $10 million for each year presented. Debt expense for 2007 also included the write off of approximately $4 million of deferred financing costs associated with the principal prepayments on our term loans. The decrease in interest expense in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt and the result of lower notional amounts of fixed rate swap agreements that contained higher rates. As of December 31, 2009, the notional amounts of our fixed rate swaps were approximately $389 million as compared to approximately $790 million at December 31, 2008. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2009 was 4.86% as compared to 5.82% in 2008. The decrease in interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Our overall weighted average interest rate in 2008 was 5.82% as compared to 6.49% in 2007. Equity investment income. Equity investment income was approximately $2.4 million in 2009 as compared to $0.8 million in 2008. The increase in equity investment income in 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the number of equity investments and improved profitability at several joint ventures. Equity investment income in 2008 remained flat as compared to 2007. Other income. Other income was approximately $4 million, $12 million, and $22 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, and consisted principally of interest income. The decrease in other income in 2009 was primarily the result of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash balances. The decrease in other income in 2008 as compared to 2007, was primarily due to the fact that 2007 included gains on the sale of investments of approximately $6 million resulting from the sale of our investment in NxStage Medical Inc. and a decrease in interest rates as well as lower average cash and investment balances. Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for 2009 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 36.7%, compared with 35.9% and 36.4% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2008 was lower primarily due to nonrecurring tax benefits associated with transactions occurring in 2008. We currently project the effective income tax rate for 2010 to be in the range of 36.5% to 37.5%. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, and our investments in ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that an impairment review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. These types of adjustments are charged directly to the corresponding operating segment that incurred the charge. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. Noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $57 million, $47 million and $47 million, respectively. The increase in noncontrolling interests in 2009 was primarily due to an increase in new dialysis centers having minority partners and growth in the earnings of our existing dialysis joint ventures. The percentage of dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues generated from dialysis related joint ventures was approximately 16% in 2009 compared to 15% in 2008. 48 Table of Contents Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2009 and 2008 represented approximately 68 and 70 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt allowance. The relative decrease in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2009 was a result of improved cash collections on current outstanding balances. Accounts receivable balances of approximately 70 days of revenue is more consistent with our past experience levels and expected trends. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately $201 million and $102 million in unreserved accounts receivable, respectively, representing approximately 18% and 9% of our total accounts receivable balance, respectively, were more than six months old. During 2009, we experienced delays in cash collections from certain government payors and certain commercial payors. We anticipate that we will collect these outstanding balances since we believe the delays in collections relate primarily to the timing of payors processing our claims for payment. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than 2% of our treatments are classified as patient pay. Substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $46 million and $39 million, respectively, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Currently, our Medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. However, the payment received from Medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. Such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements, except for potentially limiting the collectibility of these Medicare bad debt claims. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2009, our cash balance was $539 million and we had undrawn credit under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $250 million, of which approximately $52 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2009 amounted to $667 million, compared with $614 million for 2008. Cash flow from operations in 2009 included cash interest payments of approximately $186 million and cash tax payments of $162 million. Cash flow from operations in 2008 included cash interest payments of $223 million and cash tax payments of $163 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2009 included $275 million for capital asset expenditures, including $161 million for new center developments and relocations, and $114 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $88 million for acquisitions. During 2009, we also received $33 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, we received $75 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $68 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $13 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 2.9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $154 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2008 included $318 million for capital asset expenditures, including $213 million for new center developments and relocations and $105 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $102 million for acquisitions. During 2008, we also received $43 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, we received 49 Table of Contents $48 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $59 million and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $19 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 4.8 million shares of our common stock for approximately $233 million. During 2009, we acquired a total of 19 dialysis centers, opened 78 new dialysis centers, sold or closed eight centers, merged 16 centers into other existing centers, made equity investments in six centers and added two centers under management and administrative service agreements. During 2008, we acquired a total of 20 dialysis centers, opened 86 new dialysis centers, sold or closed nine centers, merged eight centers into other existing centers, ceased operations at one joint venture in which we owned an equity investment and added a net two centers under management and administrative service agreements. We currently expect to spend approximately $125 million for general maintenance capital asset expenditures in 2010, and approximately $250 million for new center development, relocations and center acquisitions depending upon the availability of certain projects and sufficient project returns which does not include any potential expenditures for our new corporate headquarters. We expect to generate approximately $675 million to $725 million of operating cash flow in 2010. Our actual expenditures for growth and cash flows in 2010 could vary significantly from these expected amounts. 2009 capital structure changes and other items Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain customary affirmative and negative covenants and require compliance with financial covenants, including an interest rate coverage ratio and a leverage ratio that determines the interest rate margins on our term loan A and our revolving line of credit. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities in general also contain limits on the general amount of capital expenditures for internal growth, acquisitions and capital improvements, as described below, as well as limits on the amount of tangible net assets in non guarantor subsidiaries. Term Loan A During 2009, we made mandatory principal payments totaling $61.3 million on our term loan A. As a result of these principal payments, the outstanding balance on term loan A as of December 31, 2009 was $153.1 million and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall weighted average effective rate of 1.74%. The interest rate margin is subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term loan A matures in October 2011 and requires annual principal payments of $87.5 million in 2010 and $65.6 million in 2011, respectively. Term Loan B As of December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance of our term loan B was $1.7 billion and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% for an overall weighted average effective rate of 2.66%, including the impact of our swap agreements. We did not make any principal payments on term loan B during 2009, nor were we required to. Term loan B matures in October 2012 and requires principal payments of $1.7 billion in 2012. Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes Our senior and senior subordinated notes, as of December 31, 2009, consisted of $900 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments in March and September. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. 50 Table of Contents Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2009, we maintained a total of eight interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $389 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.88% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.78% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2009, 2008, and 2007 we accrued net cash (obligations) benefits of approximately ($17.3) million, $(4.2) million, and $14.5 million, respectively, from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. We estimate that approximately $8.9 million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2009 will be reclassified into income in 2010. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the total fair value of these swaps were liabilities of $10.8 million and $21.9 million, respectively. The 2009 amount was included in other current liabilities. The 2008 amount was primarily included in other long term liabilities. Also during 2009, we recorded approximately $8.0 million, net of tax, as an increase to other comprehensive income for amounts reclassified into income, net of swap valuation losses. In 2008, we recorded $10.4 million, net of tax, as reductions to other comprehensive income for swap valuation losses, net of amounts reclassified into income. As of December 31, 2009, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 21% of our variable rate debt and approximately 59% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements, our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 2.63%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, as of December 31, 2009. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2009 was 4.86% and as of December 31, 2009 was 4.68%. Stock repurchases During 2009, we repurchased a total of 2,902,619 shares of our common stock for $153.5 million, or an average price of $52.88 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. On November 3, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an increase of an additional $500 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2009 was $500 million. We have not repurchased any additional shares of our common stock from January 1, 2010 through February 25, 2010. This stock repurchase program has no expiration date. Stock based compensation Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in all prior periods. During 2009, we granted 4,211,840 stock settled stock appreciation rights with a grant date fair value of $50.9 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 3.5 years, and also granted 48,135 stock units with a grant date fair value of $2.6 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 2.5 years. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recognized $44.4 million and $41.2 million, respectively, in stock based compensation expense for stock options, stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock units and discounted employee stock plan purchases, which is primarily included in general and 51 Table of Contents administrative expenses. The estimated tax benefits recorded for this stock based compensation in 2009 and 2008 were $16.8 million and $15.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, there was $80.0 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we received $63.7 million and $35.6 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $18.2 million and $14.0 million, respectively, in total actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. 2008 capital structure changes Term Loan A During 2008, we made mandatory principal payments totaling $14.9 million on our term loan A. As a result of these principal payments, the outstanding balance on term loan A as of December 31, 2008 was $214.4 million and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall weighted average effective rate of 1.97%. The interest rate margin is subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term Loan B As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance of our term loan B was $1.7 billion and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% for an overall weighted average effective rate of 3.63%, including the impact of our swap agreements. We did not make any principal payments on term loan B during 2008, nor were we required to. Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes Our senior and senior subordinated notes, as of December 31, 2008, consisted of $900 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments in March and September. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. Stock repurchases During 2008, we repurchased a total of 4,788,881 shares of our common stock for $232.7 million, or an average price of $48.59 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. On May 1, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of an additional $143.5 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2008 was $153.5 million. This stock repurchase program had no expiration date. Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2008, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $790 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.54%, on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. As of December 31, 2008, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 41% of our variable rate debt and approximately 69% of our total debt. 52 Table of Contents As a result of the swap agreements our overall weighted average effective interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 3.48%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 our overall weighted average effective interest rate was 5.10%. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases and letters of credit as well as potential obligations associated with our equity investments and to dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several joint ventures and for some of our non wholly owned subsidiaries in the form of put provisions. These put provisions, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners noncontrolling interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the noncontrolling interests put to us, which is intended to approximate fair value. The methodology we use to estimate the fair value of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions assumes either the higher of a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings, based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. The estimate of the fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions is a critical accounting estimate that involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners noncontrolling interests. The amount of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions that contractually employ a predetermined multiple of earnings rather than fair value are immaterial. For additional information see Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several other dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties or centers in which we own an equity investment, as well as to physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under management and administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2009 (in millions): Less Than1 year 2 3years 4 5years After5 years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 100 $ 1,774 $ 901 $ 850 $ 3,625 Interest payments on senior and senior subordinated notes 121 243 153 31 548 Capital lease obligations 2 1 2 5 Operating leases 216 374 283 439 1,312 $ 437 $ 2,393 $ 1,338 $ 1,322 $ 5,490 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 52 $ $ $ $ 52 Noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions 169 56 52 55 332 Pay fixed swaps potential obligations 11 11 Operating capital advances 7 7 Income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 19 19 $ 258 $ 56 $ 52 $ 55 $ 421 53 Table of Contents Not included above are interest payments related to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2009 bear interest at LIBOR plus current margins of 1.50%. The term loan A and the revolving line of credit are adjustable depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2009, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities had an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 2.63%, including the effects of our swap agreements. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific debt tranches within each term loan, which can range in maturity from one month to twelve months. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of mandatory principal payments and principal prepayments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no principal prepayments on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities during 2010 and no changes in the effective interest rate, including the interest rate margin, approximately $49 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2010. The pay fixed swap obligations represent the estimated fair market values of our interest rate swap agreements as reported by various broker dealers that are based upon relevant observable market inputs as well as other current market conditions that existed as of December 31, 2009, and represent the estimated potential obligation that we would be required to pay based upon the estimated future settlement of each specific tranche within the swap agreements. The actual amount of our obligation associated with these swaps in the future will depend upon changes in the LIBOR based interest rates that can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions, and other relevant factors that can affect the fair market value of these swap agreements. In addition to the above commitments, we are obligated to purchase a certain amount of our hemodialysis products and supplies at fixed prices through 2015 from Gambro Renal Products, Inc. in connection with the Product Supply Agreement. Our total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs in each year. In January 2010, we entered into an agreement with Fresenius which committed us to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies from them through 2013. The actual amount of purchases in future years from Gambro Renal Products and Fresenius will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, and in the case of the Product Supply Agreement, Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. Settlements of approximately $15 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made. Contingencies The information in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly 54 Table of Contents variable compensation accruals, purchase accounting valuation estimates, fair value estimates and stock based compensation are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, slow down in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 118,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as 6% of consolidated operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairments of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers or other operations. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the 55 Table of Contents expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year, and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. We are required to assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and to also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain and future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. We make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets, liabilities and contractual as well as non contractual contingencies associated with our acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Long lived tangible and intangible assets are subject to our regular ongoing impairment assessments. Fair value estimates. We have recorded certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions at fair value. The FASB defines fair value which is measured based upon certain valuation techniques that include inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. We have measured the fair values of our applicable assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions based upon certain market inputs and assumptions that are either observable or unobservable in determining fair values and have also classified these assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels. The fair value of our investments available for sale are based upon quoted market prices from active markets and the fair value of our swap agreements are based upon valuation models and a variety of techniques as reported by various broker dealers that are based upon relevant observable market inputs such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, and other credit and liquidity market conditions. For our noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions we have estimated the fair values of these based upon either the higher of a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. The estimate of the fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners noncontrolling interests. 56 Table of Contents Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 include compensation costs for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of December 31, 2006, and stock based awards granted thereafter. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk free interest rates. Significant new accounting standards On June 29, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the single source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for all nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are also sources of authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification does not change U.S. GAAP but takes previously issued FASB standards and other U.S. GAAP authoritative pronouncements, changes the way the standards are referred to, and includes them in specific topic areas. The Codification is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of the Codification did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. Effective for our first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, the FASB is eliminating the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and requiring additional disclosures about an enterprises involvement in variable interest entities. An enterprise will be required to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity by having both the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity, or the right to receive benefits from the entity. In addition, the FASB is establishing new guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity, requiring an ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and adding an additional reconsideration event for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity when any changes in facts and circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk, as a group, lose the power from voting rights or similar rights concerning those investments to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. We are currently in the process of assessing the expected impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. Effective May 28, 2009, the FASB issued requirements relating to the accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. These requirements set forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. These requirements do not apply to subsequent events or transactions that are within the scope of other applicable principles of GAAP that provide different guidance on the accounting treatment for subsequent events or transactions. These requirements were effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. Effective January 1, 2009, we are required to provide enhanced disclosures about our derivative and hedging activities. We are required to provide additional disclosures about (a) how and why we use derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. These requirements did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for the disclosure of these items. 57 Table of Contents Effective January 1, 2009, we are required to treat noncontrolling interests as a separate component of equity, but apart from our equity, and not as a liability or other item outside of equity. We are also required to identify and present consolidated net income attributable to us and to noncontrolling interests on the face of the consolidated statement of income. Previously, we had reported minority interests (noncontrolling interests) as a reduction to operating income. In addition, changes in our ownership interest while we retain a controlling financial interest should be accounted for as equity transactions. We were also required to expand disclosures in the financial statements to include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the equity attributable to us and the noncontrolling owners and a schedule showing the effects of changes in our ownership interest in a subsidiary on the equity attributable to us. This change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements; however, it did change the presentation of minority interests (noncontrolling interests) in our consolidated financial statements. In conjunction with adopting these requirements, we are required to classify securities with redemption features that are not solely within our control such as our noncontrolling interests that are subject to put provisions outside of permanent equity and to measure these noncontrolling interests at fair value. See Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for further details. The consolidated financial statements have been recast for all prior periods presented for the retrospective application of these presentation and disclosure requirements. All business combinations consummated after January 1, 2009, are required to be accounted for under the acquisition method (previously referred to as the purchase method). Under the acquisition method, the acquirer recognizes the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, as well as any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date. Noncontractual contingencies are recognized at the acquisition date at their fair values only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability. Transaction costs are excluded from the acquisition cost and are expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration included by the acquirer as part of the purchase price must also be measured at fair value at the acquisition date and is classified as either equity or a liability. A company that obtains control but acquires less than 100% of an acquiree is required to record 100% of the fair value of the acquiree assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests at the acquisition date. The adoption of these requirements did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2008, the FASB required public entities to provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets and required public enterprises to provide additional disclosures about their involvement in variable interest entities and certain special purpose entities. Because these requirements impact disclosures and not the accounting treatment for transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities, these requirements did not impact our financial condition or results of operations. Effective January 1, 2008, the FASB established a framework for measuring fair value and also required additional disclosures about fair value measurements. These requirements applied to assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. Effective January 1, 2009 the FASB issued additional requirements relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). See note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for the impact of these requirements. The adoption of these requirements relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Effective January 1, 2008, the FASB allows companies the alternative to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis that are currently not required to be measured at fair value. This provision is also designed to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The adoption of this provision did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 58 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2009. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average LIBOR rates in effect for all debt tranches plus margins in effect at the end of 2009 including the economic effects of our swap agreements. Term loan A and revolving line of credit interest rate margins are subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio. The margins currently in effect at December 31, 2009 were 1.50% on all of the outstanding balances under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. For our interest rate swap agreements, the table below presents the notional amounts by contract maturity date and the related interest rate terms of the agreements (to pay fixed rates, and to receive LIBOR). Expected maturity date Total FairValue Averageinterestrate 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 2 $ 1 $ 1 $ 901 $ 1 $ 852 $ 1,758 $ 1,765 6.88 % Variable rate $ 98 $ 67 $ 1,707 $ $ $ $ 1,872 $ 1,829 2.62 % Notionalamount Contract maturity date Payfixed Receivevariable Fairvalue 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 (dollars in millions) Swaps: Pay fixed swaps $ 389 $ 389 $ $ $ $ 3.88% to 4.70% LIBOR $ (10.8 ) Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which include the term loan A and the term loan B, consist of various individual tranches that can range in maturity from one month to twelve months and each specific tranche bears interest at a LIBOR rate that is determined by the maturity of that specific tranche plus an interest rate margin, which is currently 1.50% at December 31, 2009. LIBOR based interest rates are reset as each specific tranche matures and a new tranche is re established and can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions including the credit and capital markets. Any increase in the LIBOR based interest rates on the unhedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2009 will have a negative impact on our overall earnings. As of December 31, 2009, we maintained a total of eight interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $389 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.88% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.78% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2009, we accrued net cash obligations of $17.3 million from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2009, the total fair value of these swaps was a liability of $10.8 million. During 2009, we recorded $8.0 million, net of tax, as an increase to other comprehensive income for amounts reclassified into income, net of swap valuation losses. As of December 31, 2009, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 21% of our variable rate debt and approximately 59% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements, our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 2.63%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50% as of December 31, 2009. 59 Table of Contents Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2009 was 4.86% and as of December 31, 2009 was 4.68%. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $8.5 million, $7.1 million, and $5.5 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements that do not concern historical facts are forward looking statements and include, among other things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, operating cash flow, estimated tax rates, capital expenditures, the development of new centers and center acquisitions, government and commercial payment rates, revenue estimating risk and the impact of our related level of indebtedness on our financial performance, including earnings per share. These statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements, including, but not limited to, risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, the variability of our cash flows, the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates or changes to the structure of payments under the Medicare ESRD program or other government based programs, including, for example, the implementation of a bundled payment rate system which will lower reimbursement for services we provide to Medicare patients, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations, the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies, and the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,530 outpatient dialysis centers and approximately 720 hospitals, serving approximately 118,000 patients in 43 states. In 2009, our overall network of dialysis centers increased by 81 centers primarily as a result of opening new centers and acquisitions and the overall number of patients that we serve increased by approximately 5.5%. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three stakeholders our patients, our business partners, and our teammates represents the major driver of our long term performance, although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes as measured by DQI have improved over each of the past three years. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States. In addition, over the past several years our teammate turnover has remained relatively constant, although in 2009 we did experience a decrease in our overall teammate turnover. We believe this was a major contributor to our continued clinical performance improvements and also a major driver in our ability to improve productivity in 2009. We will continue to focus on these stakeholders and our clinical outcomes as we believe these are fundamental long term value drivers. 38 Table of Contents Approximately 95% of our 2009 consolidated net operating revenues were derived directly from our dialysis and related lab services business. Approximately 84% of our 2009 dialysis and related lab services revenues were derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in the 1,498 centers that we consolidate, which are either wholly owned or majority owned. Other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services. These services collectively accounted for the balance of our 2009 dialysis and related lab services revenues. We also generate management fees from management and administrative services to certain third party owned dialysis centers and dialysis centers that we own an equity investment in. These management fees represent less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. Our other business operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. These consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs and physician services. These services generated approximately $317 million of net operating revenues in 2009, or approximately 5% of our consolidated net operating revenues. Overall our ancillary services and strategic initiatives decreased their operating losses from $30 million in 2008 to $18 million in 2009, primarily as a result of improved profitability in our pharmacy and disease management businesses. We currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives as we work to develop successful new business operations. However, any significant change in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes could result in a write off or an impairment of some or all of our investments, including goodwill, in these strategic initiatives, or could also result in significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are: the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week, as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services; average dialysis revenue per treatment; and the number of laboratory patient tests. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, which we believe is influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our ability to open and acquire new centers. Our year over year treatment volume growth was 4.9% in 2009. Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment is primarily driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, and our billing and collecting operations performance. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are significantly higher than Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis revenue per treatment. The percentage of commercial patients covered under contracted plans as compared to commercial patients with out of network providers can also significantly affect our average dialysis revenue per treatment. In 2009, the growth of our government based patients, driven primarily by growth in Medicare assigned plans, which we believe is largely as a result of improved mortality and the current economic recession, outpaced the growth in our commercial patients, which negatively impacted our average dialysis revenue per treatment as a result of receiving lower payment rates associated with these additional government based patients. 39 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009: Revenues Medicare and Medicare assigned plans 57 % Medicaid and Medicaid assigned plans 6 % Other government based programs 2 % Total government based programs 65 % Commercial (including hospital dialysis services) 35 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Government payment rates are principally determined by federal Medicare and state Medicaid policy. These payment rates have historically had limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reduction as federal and state governments face increasing budget pressures. Medicare payment rates for dialysis services through 2008 have not been routinely increased to compensate for the impact of inflation. In July 2008, MIPPA was passed by Congress which introduced a new payment system for dialysis services beginning in January 2011 whereby ESRD payments will be made under a bundled payment rate which will provide for a fixed rate for all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment. The legislation also provided for an increase in the composite rate of 1% effective January 1, 2009 and an additional 1% effective January 1, 2010. On September 15, 2009, CMS released the proposed rule regarding the new bundled payment rate system. The initial 2011 bundled rate is required to be set based on a 2% reduction in the payment rate that providers would have received under the historical fee for service payment methodology and based on the lowest average industry pharmaceutical utilization from 2007 to 2009. The combined effect of the adjustments provided in the proposed rule would result in a bundled rate that represents a significantly greater than 2% reduction in the payment rate that we would have received for our services prior to bundling. The proposed rule also requires, among other things, the new single bundled payment base rate to be adjusted annually for inflation based upon a market basket index, less 1% of such index, beginning in 2012. Dialysis providers have the option to move fully to the bundled payment system in 2011 or to phase in the payment system over three years. Dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with large payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. In 2009, we were successful in maintaining and in some instances increasing average payment rates, resulting in an aggregate increase in average payment rates for patients with commercial plans. However, we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors and payors are aggressive in their negotiations. If our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, this would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, if there are sustained or increased job losses in the United States as a result of current economic conditions, or depending upon changes to the healthcare regulatory system, we could experience a decrease in the number of patients under commercial plans. We also expect that some of our contracted rates with commercial payors may decrease or we may experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. In addition, payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations on non contracted or out of network providers, which could further decrease our commercial rate revenues since rates for out of network providers are on average higher than rates for in network providers. Approximately 30% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were from physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for approximately 20% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. Therefore, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in commercial and governmental payment rates for EPO significantly influence our revenue. For example, effective January 2008, changes to the EPO monitoring policy went into effect which further limited reimbursements and impacted the prescribing habits of our physicians, which 40 Table of Contents resulted in lower pharmaceutical intensities during 2008. In 2009, the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals increased slightly from 2008, which helped contribute to an increase in our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past several years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. In 2009, we continued to upgrade our systems and implemented process changes and will continue to do so in 2010 as necessary to improve our billing and collection performance. However, as we implement these system upgrades, our collection performance as well as our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment could be negatively impacted. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date based upon our actual historical collection experience. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was approximately $340, $334 and $334 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2009, the increase in our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was primarily due to a 1% increase in the Medicare composite rate, an increase in our commercial payment rates, an increase in our reimbursement rates for EPO and other pharmaceuticals and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by changes in the mix of our commercial payors. In 2008, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was flat as compared to 2007, but was impacted by some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, a decrease in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals offset by changes in mix and rates of some of our other commercial payors. Our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, including the bundling of such services, and changes in the mix of government and commercial payors may materially impact our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in the future. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals and business infrastructure, including the operating costs of our dialysis centers, and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost variability, such as employee benefit costs and insurance costs. Our average clinical hours per treatment have remained relatively stable over the past few years primarily because of improved efficiencies driven by reduced clinical teammate turnover and improved training and processes. In 2009, we were able to reduce our average clinical hours per treatment from 2008 as a result of continued productivity improvements primarily through reduced teammate turnover and the fact that 2008 was negatively impacted by the implementation of new federal guidelines. We continue to strive for improved productivity levels, however we may not be able to sustain our 2009 performance as changes in federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels, as would improvements in the U.S. economy, which could stimulate additional competition for skilled clinical personnel, and result in higher teammate turnover. In 2009 and 2008, we also experienced an increase in our labor rates of approximately 2.5% and 3.5%, respectively, as labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. In 2009, we experienced an increase in our pharmaceutical costs, mainly related to EPO, which increased by approximately 2%. In addition, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO provides for specific rebates based on a combination of factors, including process improvement and data submission, which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to continue to qualify for these rebates. In 2009, we experienced increases in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new centers opened, and general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. 41 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of consolidated revenues over the past three years. However, this reflects a substantial increase in the dollar amount of spending related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal matters and supporting the growth in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. We expect that the level of general and administrative expenses will be sustained and may vary depending upon the level of investment we make in our long term initiatives, including further investments in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and to support our regulatory compliance efforts. Outlook for 2010. Currently, we still expect our operating income for 2010 to be in the range of $950 million to $1,020 million and we also expect our operating cash flows for 2010 to be in the range of $675 million to $725 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks and uncertainties, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates or changes to the structure of payments under the Medicare ESRD program or other government based programs, including, for example, the implementation of a bundled payment rate system which will lower reimbursement for services we provide to Medicare patients, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the cautionary language contained in the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 38 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. Results of operations We operate principally as a dialysis and related lab services business but also operate other ancillary services and strategic initiatives. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services (VillageHealth), vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs and physician services. The dialysis and related lab services business qualifies as a separately reportable segment and all of the other ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been combined and disclosed in the other segments category. Following is a summary of consolidated operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. Year ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 6,109 100 % $ 5,660 100 % $ 5,264 100 % Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 4,249 70 % 3,920 69 % 3,590 68 % General and administrative 532 9 % 508 9 % 491 9 % Depreciation and amortization 229 4 % 217 4 % 193 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 162 3 % 146 3 % 137 3 % Equity investment income (2 ) (1 ) (1 ) Valuation gain on alliance and product supply agreement (55 ) (1 )% Total operating expenses and charges 5,169 85 % 4,791 85 % 4,355 83 % Operating income $ 940 15 % $ 869 15 % $ 909 17 % 42 Table of Contents The following table summarizes consolidated net operating revenues: Year ended 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 5,792 $ 5,415 $ 5,130 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives 317 245 134 Consolidated net operating revenues $ 6,109 $ 5,660 $ 5,264 The following table summarizes consolidated operating income: Year ended 2009 2008(2) 2007(1)(2) (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 1,000 $ 939 $ 990 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives loss (18 ) (30 ) (48 ) Total segment operating income 982 910 942 Reconciling items: Stock based compensation (44 ) (41 ) (34 ) Equity investment income 2 1 1 Consolidated operating income 940 869 909 Reconciliation of non GAAP measures: Less: Gains on insurance settlements (7 ) Valuation gain on the alliance and product supply agreement (55 ) Non GAAP consolidated operating income $ 940 $ 869 $ 847 (1) In 2007, we have excluded valuation gains on the alliance and product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products Inc. (the Product Supply Agreement) as well as gains on insurance settlements from Hurricane Katrina from non GAAP adjusted consolidated operating income in 2007 because management believes that this presentation enhances a users understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding a non recurring non cash gain that resulted from the termination of our purchase obligation for dialysis machines from Gambro Renal Products Inc. under the Product Supply Agreement as well as an unusual insurance gain, and as a result is both more meaningful and comparable to our current and prior period results, and more indicative of our normal consolidated operating income. (2) Certain costs previously reported in ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been reclassified to dialysis and related lab services to conform to the current year presentation. Consolidated net operating revenues Consolidated net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $449 million or approximately 7.9% from 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $377 million, principally due to increased treatments, and an increase of approximately $72 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues primarily from growth in our pharmacy services, VillageHealth services and from our infusion therapy services. Consolidated net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $396 million or approximately 7.5% from 2007. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $285 million, principally due to increased treatments, and an increase of approximately $111 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues primarily from growth in our pharmacy services, VillageHealth services and from our infusion therapy services. 43 Table of Contents Consolidated operating income Consolidated operating income of $940 million for 2009 increased by approximately $71 million from 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue as a result of non acquired treatment growth in dialysis and related lab services, as well as an increase in our dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6 as described below. Operating income also increased as a result of cost control initiatives, improved productivity and lower operating losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, which losses were reduced by approximately $12 million in 2009, partially offset by the negative impact of higher pharmaceutical, labor and benefit costs, and increases in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Consolidated operating income was $869 million for 2008, as compared to $909 million for 2007. Consolidated operating income in 2007 included a valuation gain of $55 million on the Product Supply Agreement and the $7 million insurance settlement related to Hurricane Katrina. Excluding the valuation gain on the Product Supply Agreement and the insurance settlement in 2007, our consolidated operating income for 2008 would have increased by approximately $22 million, compared to the adjusted operating income for 2007. This increase in consolidated operating income for 2008 as compared to adjusted operating income for 2007 was primarily due to treatment growth in dialysis and related lab services revenues, combined with growth in revenue in ancillary services and strategic initiatives outpacing increases in our operating expenses. Our ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating losses were reduced by approximately $18 million in 2008. However, our consolidated operating income for 2008 was negatively affected by rising labor costs, the absence of a Medicare rate increase, the impact of some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, decreases in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, an increase in the operating costs of our dialysis centers, driven in part by the number of new dialysis centers opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, an increase in pharmaceutical costs (primarily heparin) and an increase in stock based compensation costs. Operating segments Dialysis and Related Lab Services Year ended 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, exceptper treatment data) Revenues $ 5,792 $ 5,415 $ 5,130 Segment operating income $ 1,000 $ 939 $ 990 Dialysis treatments 17,010,450 16,217,107 15,318,995 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 54,433 51,663 48,942 Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment $ 340 $ 334 $ 334 Net operating revenues Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $377 million or approximately 6.9% from 2008. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 4.7%, and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6, or 1.9%. The increase in the number of treatments was primarily due to an increase in non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. The increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2009, as compared to 2008, was primarily due to a 1% Medicare increase in the Medicare composite rate, an increase in our commercial payment rates, an increase in our reimbursement rates for EPO and other pharmaceuticals, and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by changes in the mix of our commercial payors. Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $285 million or approximately 5.6% from 2007. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the 44 Table of Contents number of treatments of approximately 5.7%, offset by a slight decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment. The increase in number of treatments was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatment days in 2008, as compared to 2007, and non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. The decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily due to the impact of some commercial rate compression that occurred in late 2007, decreases in intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by changes in the mix and rates of some of our other commercial payors. The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues by modality for the year ended December 31, 2009: Revenuepercentages Outpatient hemodialysis centers 84 % Peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis 11 % Hospital inpatient hemodialysis 5 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % In addition to reimbursements for dialysis treatments, the other major component of dialysis and related lab services revenues is the administration of EPO and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment, which represents slightly more than 30% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009. Approximately 65% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare assigned plans, representing approximately 88% of our total patients. Approximately 35% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues and 12% of our patients are associated with commercial payors. Less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services payments are due directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 5% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009. On average we are paid significantly more for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans than we are for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other government plans such as Medicare assigned plans. Patients covered by commercial health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. As of December 31, 2009, the Medicare ESRD dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between $150 and $167 per treatment, or an overall average of $159 per treatment, excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Nearly all of our net earnings from dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates as established by contract and others of which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule. We are continuously in negotiations with commercial payors for contracted rates and some of these payment rates are under downward pressure as we negotiate these rates with large HMOs and insurance carriers and we expect this trend to continue. We also expect that we may experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. In addition, payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations on non contracted or out of network providers, in which we receive higher payment rates than for in network providers. If we experience a net overall reduction in our contracted and non contracted commercial rates as a result of these negotiations or restrictions, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors, including our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted and non contracted 45 Table of Contents commercial payors, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals, including the bundling of such services and changes in the mix of government and non government payments. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and operating costs of the dialysis centers. The dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $234, $230 and $227 for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The $4 increase in the per treatment costs in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to higher labor rates and benefit costs, an increase in pharmaceutical costs, an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers and a increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by improved productivity. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis increased by approximately $3 in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in the per treatment costs was primarily attributable to an increase in labor rates as well as the negative impact on productivity during the year as we implemented new federal guidelines. Additionally, we experienced an increase in the operating costs of our dialysis centers driven in part by the number of new centers opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, and an increase in pharmaceutical costs, partially offset by a decrease in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals. General and administrative expenses. Dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses for the years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $427 million, $402 million and $400 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $25 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to increases in labor and benefit costs, partially offset by the timing of certain other expenditures. The increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $2 million in 2008 as compared to 2007, was primarily due to increases in labor costs and the timing of certain other expenditures, mainly offset by lower integration costs and lower professional fees. Depreciation and amortization. Dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $222 million, $210 million and $189 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $12 million in depreciation and amortization for dialysis and related lab services in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to growth through new center developments and expansions. The increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $21 million in 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily due to growth through new center developments and expansions and a change in amortization associated with amendments to the Product Supply Agreement. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for dialysis and related lab services was 2.7% for 2009 and 2.6% for 2008 and 2007. The increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts in 2009 was primarily to reflect a slowdown in the timing of payments from some of our non government payors. The current provision level of 2.7% may increase if we encounter problems with our billing and collection process as a result of sustained weakness in the U.S. economy. Operating income Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2009 increased by approximately $61 million as compared to 2008. The increase in the operating income for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to growth in the number of dialysis treatments, an increase in the dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6 as described above. The dialysis and related lab services operating income also increased as a result of certain cost control initiatives and improved productivity, but was negatively impacted primarily by higher labor and benefit costs, an increase in pharmaceutical costs and an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. 46 Table of Contents Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2008 decreased by approximately $51 million as compared to 2007. Operating income in 2007 included a valuation gain of $55 million on the Product Supply Agreement and $7 million of insurance settlements relating to Hurricane Katrina as discussed above. Excluding these items, operating income for 2008 would have increased by approximately $11 million as compared to adjusted operating income for 2007. The increase in the operating income for 2008 as compared to adjusted operating income for 2007 was primarily due to growth in the volume of revenue outpacing increases in certain expenditures. However, operating income for 2008 was negatively affected by certain significant items such as a decrease in our dialysis revenue per treatment, lower intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, an increase in labor costs and higher operating costs of our dialysis centers primarily associated with the number of new centers that were opened and from centers constructed but pending state and or federal certification, an increase in pharmaceutical costs (primarily heparin), and the absence of a Medicare rate increase. Other Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Year ended 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Revenues $ 317 $ 245 $ 134 Segment operating loss $ (18 ) $ (30 ) $ (48 ) Net operating revenues The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $72 million or 29.5% as compared to 2008, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, VillageHealth services and from our infusion therapy services. The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2008 increased by approximately $111 million or 82.7% as compared to 2007, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, VillageHealth services, vascular access services and a full year of operations of our infusion therapy services which we acquired in the third quarter of 2007. Operating expenses Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2009 increased by approximately $60 million from 2008, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business, an increase in labor and benefit costs, partially offset by lower professional fees. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2008 increased by approximately $93 million from 2007, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business, an increase in fixed operating expenses, an increase in labor costs and a full year of operations of our infusion therapy services, partially offset by lower professional fees in our VillageHealth business. Operating loss Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2009 decreased by approximately $12 million from 2008. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to volume growth in revenues outpacing increases in operating expenses, primarily associated with our pharmacy business and our VillageHealth business, partially offset by an increase in operating losses associated with certain new initiatives. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2008 decreased by approximately $18 million from 2007. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to growth in revenues outpacing increases in operating expenses, primarily associated with our pharmacy business and our vascular access services. 47 Table of Contents Corporate level charges Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation of approximately $44 million for 2009 increased by approximately $3 million from 2008. Stock based compensation for 2008 increased by approximately $7 million from 2007. The increases in both periods resulted from an increase in the aggregate quantity of grants that contributed expense to each of these years. Debt expense. Debt expense for 2009, 2008, and 2007 consisted of interest expense of approximately $176 million, $215 million, and $243 million, respectively, and amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $10 million for each year presented. Debt expense for 2007 also included the write off of approximately $4 million of deferred financing costs associated with the principal prepayments on our term loans. The decrease in interest expense in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt and the result of lower notional amounts of fixed rate swap agreements that contained higher rates. As of December 31, 2009, the notional amounts of our fixed rate swaps were approximately $389 million as compared to approximately $790 million at December 31, 2008. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2009 was 4.86% as compared to 5.82% in 2008. The decrease in interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Our overall weighted average interest rate in 2008 was 5.82% as compared to 6.49% in 2007. Equity investment income. Equity investment income was approximately $2.4 million in 2009 as compared to $0.8 million in 2008. The increase in equity investment income in 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the number of equity investments and improved profitability at several joint ventures. Equity investment income in 2008 remained flat as compared to 2007. Other income. Other income was approximately $4 million, $12 million, and $22 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, and consisted principally of interest income. The decrease in other income in 2009 was primarily the result of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash balances. The decrease in other income in 2008 as compared to 2007, was primarily due to the fact that 2007 included gains on the sale of investments of approximately $6 million resulting from the sale of our investment in NxStage Medical Inc. and a decrease in interest rates as well as lower average cash and investment balances. Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for 2009 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 36.7%, compared with 35.9% and 36.4% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2008 was lower primarily due to nonrecurring tax benefits associated with transactions occurring in 2008. We currently project the effective income tax rate for 2010 to be in the range of 36.5% to 37.5%. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, and our investments in ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that an impairment review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. These types of adjustments are charged directly to the corresponding operating segment that incurred the charge. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. Noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $57 million, $47 million and $47 million, respectively. The increase in noncontrolling interests in 2009 was primarily due to an increase in new dialysis centers having minority partners and growth in the earnings of our existing dialysis joint ventures. The percentage of dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues generated from dialysis related joint ventures was approximately 16% in 2009 compared to 15% in 2008. 48 Table of Contents Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2009 and 2008 represented approximately 68 and 70 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt allowance. The relative decrease in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2009 was a result of improved cash collections on current outstanding balances. Accounts receivable balances of approximately 70 days of revenue is more consistent with our past experience levels and expected trends. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately $201 million and $102 million in unreserved accounts receivable, respectively, representing approximately 18% and 9% of our total accounts receivable balance, respectively, were more than six months old. During 2009, we experienced delays in cash collections from certain government payors and certain commercial payors. We anticipate that we will collect these outstanding balances since we believe the delays in collections relate primarily to the timing of payors processing our claims for payment. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than 2% of our treatments are classified as patient pay. Substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $46 million and $39 million, respectively, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Currently, our Medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. However, the payment received from Medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. Such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements, except for potentially limiting the collectibility of these Medicare bad debt claims. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2009, our cash balance was $539 million and we had undrawn credit under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $250 million, of which approximately $52 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2009 amounted to $667 million, compared with $614 million for 2008. Cash flow from operations in 2009 included cash interest payments of approximately $186 million and cash tax payments of $162 million. Cash flow from operations in 2008 included cash interest payments of $223 million and cash tax payments of $163 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2009 included $275 million for capital asset expenditures, including $161 million for new center developments and relocations, and $114 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $88 million for acquisitions. During 2009, we also received $33 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, we received $75 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $68 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $13 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 2.9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $154 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2008 included $318 million for capital asset expenditures, including $213 million for new center developments and relocations and $105 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $102 million for acquisitions. During 2008, we also received $43 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, we received 49 Table of Contents $48 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $59 million and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $19 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 4.8 million shares of our common stock for approximately $233 million. During 2009, we acquired a total of 19 dialysis centers, opened 78 new dialysis centers, sold or closed eight centers, merged 16 centers into other existing centers, made equity investments in six centers and added two centers under management and administrative service agreements. During 2008, we acquired a total of 20 dialysis centers, opened 86 new dialysis centers, sold or closed nine centers, merged eight centers into other existing centers, ceased operations at one joint venture in which we owned an equity investment and added a net two centers under management and administrative service agreements. We currently expect to spend approximately $125 million for general maintenance capital asset expenditures in 2010, and approximately $250 million for new center development, relocations and center acquisitions depending upon the availability of certain projects and sufficient project returns which does not include any potential expenditures for our new corporate headquarters. We expect to generate approximately $675 million to $725 million of operating cash flow in 2010. Our actual expenditures for growth and cash flows in 2010 could vary significantly from these expected amounts. 2009 capital structure changes and other items Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain customary affirmative and negative covenants and require compliance with financial covenants, including an interest rate coverage ratio and a leverage ratio that determines the interest rate margins on our term loan A and our revolving line of credit. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities in general also contain limits on the general amount of capital expenditures for internal growth, acquisitions and capital improvements, as described below, as well as limits on the amount of tangible net assets in non guarantor subsidiaries. Term Loan A During 2009, we made mandatory principal payments totaling $61.3 million on our term loan A. As a result of these principal payments, the outstanding balance on term loan A as of December 31, 2009 was $153.1 million and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall weighted average effective rate of 1.74%. The interest rate margin is subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term loan A matures in October 2011 and requires annual principal payments of $87.5 million in 2010 and $65.6 million in 2011, respectively. Term Loan B As of December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance of our term loan B was $1.7 billion and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% for an overall weighted average effective rate of 2.66%, including the impact of our swap agreements. We did not make any principal payments on term loan B during 2009, nor were we required to. Term loan B matures in October 2012 and requires principal payments of $1.7 billion in 2012. Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes Our senior and senior subordinated notes, as of December 31, 2009, consisted of $900 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments in March and September. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. 50 Table of Contents Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2009, we maintained a total of eight interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $389 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.88% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.78% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2009, 2008, and 2007 we accrued net cash (obligations) benefits of approximately ($17.3) million, $(4.2) million, and $14.5 million, respectively, from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. We estimate that approximately $8.9 million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2009 will be reclassified into income in 2010. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the total fair value of these swaps were liabilities of $10.8 million and $21.9 million, respectively. The 2009 amount was included in other current liabilities. The 2008 amount was primarily included in other long term liabilities. Also during 2009, we recorded approximately $8.0 million, net of tax, as an increase to other comprehensive income for amounts reclassified into income, net of swap valuation losses. In 2008, we recorded $10.4 million, net of tax, as reductions to other comprehensive income for swap valuation losses, net of amounts reclassified into income. As of December 31, 2009, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 21% of our variable rate debt and approximately 59% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements, our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 2.63%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, as of December 31, 2009. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2009 was 4.86% and as of December 31, 2009 was 4.68%. Stock repurchases During 2009, we repurchased a total of 2,902,619 shares of our common stock for $153.5 million, or an average price of $52.88 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. On November 3, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an increase of an additional $500 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2009 was $500 million. We have not repurchased any additional shares of our common stock from January 1, 2010 through February 25, 2010. This stock repurchase program has no expiration date. Stock based compensation Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in all prior periods. During 2009, we granted 4,211,840 stock settled stock appreciation rights with a grant date fair value of $50.9 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 3.5 years, and also granted 48,135 stock units with a grant date fair value of $2.6 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 2.5 years. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recognized $44.4 million and $41.2 million, respectively, in stock based compensation expense for stock options, stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock units and discounted employee stock plan purchases, which is primarily included in general and 51 Table of Contents administrative expenses. The estimated tax benefits recorded for this stock based compensation in 2009 and 2008 were $16.8 million and $15.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, there was $80.0 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we received $63.7 million and $35.6 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $18.2 million and $14.0 million, respectively, in total actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. 2008 capital structure changes Term Loan A During 2008, we made mandatory principal payments totaling $14.9 million on our term loan A. As a result of these principal payments, the outstanding balance on term loan A as of December 31, 2008 was $214.4 million and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall weighted average effective rate of 1.97%. The interest rate margin is subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term Loan B As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance of our term loan B was $1.7 billion and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% for an overall weighted average effective rate of 3.63%, including the impact of our swap agreements. We did not make any principal payments on term loan B during 2008, nor were we required to. Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes Our senior and senior subordinated notes, as of December 31, 2008, consisted of $900 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments in March and September. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. Stock repurchases During 2008, we repurchased a total of 4,788,881 shares of our common stock for $232.7 million, or an average price of $48.59 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. On May 1, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of an additional $143.5 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2008 was $153.5 million. This stock repurchase program had no expiration date. Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2008, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $790 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.08% to 4.27%, resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.54%, on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. As of December 31, 2008, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 41% of our variable rate debt and approximately 69% of our total debt. 52 Table of Contents As a result of the swap agreements our overall weighted average effective interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 3.48%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 our overall weighted average effective interest rate was 5.10%. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases and letters of credit as well as potential obligations associated with our equity investments and to dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several joint ventures and for some of our non wholly owned subsidiaries in the form of put provisions. These put provisions, if exercised, would require us to purchase the third party owners noncontrolling interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the noncontrolling interests put to us, which is intended to approximate fair value. The methodology we use to estimate the fair value of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions assumes either the higher of a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings, based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. The estimate of the fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions is a critical accounting estimate that involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners noncontrolling interests. The amount of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions that contractually employ a predetermined multiple of earnings rather than fair value are immaterial. For additional information see Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several other dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties or centers in which we own an equity investment, as well as to physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under management and administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2009 (in millions): Less Than1 year 2 3years 4 5years After5 years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 100 $ 1,774 $ 901 $ 850 $ 3,625 Interest payments on senior and senior subordinated notes 121 243 153 31 548 Capital lease obligations 2 1 2 5 Operating leases 216 374 283 439 1,312 $ 437 $ 2,393 $ 1,338 $ 1,322 $ 5,490 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 52 $ $ $ $ 52 Noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions 169 56 52 55 332 Pay fixed swaps potential obligations 11 11 Operating capital advances 7 7 Income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 19 19 $ 258 $ 56 $ 52 $ 55 $ 421 53 Table of Contents Not included above are interest payments related to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2009 bear interest at LIBOR plus current margins of 1.50%. The term loan A and the revolving line of credit are adjustable depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2009, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities had an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 2.63%, including the effects of our swap agreements. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific debt tranches within each term loan, which can range in maturity from one month to twelve months. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of mandatory principal payments and principal prepayments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no principal prepayments on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities during 2010 and no changes in the effective interest rate, including the interest rate margin, approximately $49 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2010. The pay fixed swap obligations represent the estimated fair market values of our interest rate swap agreements as reported by various broker dealers that are based upon relevant observable market inputs as well as other current market conditions that existed as of December 31, 2009, and represent the estimated potential obligation that we would be required to pay based upon the estimated future settlement of each specific tranche within the swap agreements. The actual amount of our obligation associated with these swaps in the future will depend upon changes in the LIBOR based interest rates that can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions, and other relevant factors that can affect the fair market value of these swap agreements. In addition to the above commitments, we are obligated to purchase a certain amount of our hemodialysis products and supplies at fixed prices through 2015 from Gambro Renal Products, Inc. in connection with the Product Supply Agreement. Our total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs in each year. In January 2010, we entered into an agreement with Fresenius which committed us to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies from them through 2013. The actual amount of purchases in future years from Gambro Renal Products and Fresenius will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, and in the case of the Product Supply Agreement, Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. Settlements of approximately $15 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made. Contingencies The information in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly 54 Table of Contents variable compensation accruals, purchase accounting valuation estimates, fair value estimates and stock based compensation are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, slow down in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 118,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as 6% of consolidated operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairments of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers or other operations. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the 55 Table of Contents expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year, and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. We are required to assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and to also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain and future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. We make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets, liabilities and contractual as well as non contractual contingencies associated with our acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Long lived tangible and intangible assets are subject to our regular ongoing impairment assessments. Fair value estimates. We have recorded certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions at fair value. The FASB defines fair value which is measured based upon certain valuation techniques that include inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. We have measured the fair values of our applicable assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions based upon certain market inputs and assumptions that are either observable or unobservable in determining fair values and have also classified these assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels. The fair value of our investments available for sale are based upon quoted market prices from active markets and the fair value of our swap agreements are based upon valuation models and a variety of techniques as reported by various broker dealers that are based upon relevant observable market inputs such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, and other credit and liquidity market conditions. For our noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions we have estimated the fair values of these based upon either the higher of a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. The estimate of the fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners noncontrolling interests. 56 Table of Contents Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 include compensation costs for stock based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of December 31, 2006, and stock based awards granted thereafter. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk free interest rates. Significant new accounting standards On June 29, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the single source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for all nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are also sources of authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification does not change U.S. GAAP but takes previously issued FASB standards and other U.S. GAAP authoritative pronouncements, changes the way the standards are referred to, and includes them in specific topic areas. The Codification is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of the Codification did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. Effective for our first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, the FASB is eliminating the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and requiring additional disclosures about an enterprises involvement in variable interest entities. An enterprise will be required to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity by having both the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity, or the right to receive benefits from the entity. In addition, the FASB is establishing new guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity, requiring an ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and adding an additional reconsideration event for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity when any changes in facts and circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk, as a group, lose the power from voting rights or similar rights concerning those investments to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. We are currently in the process of assessing the expected impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. Effective May 28, 2009, the FASB issued requirements relating to the accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. These requirements set forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. These requirements do not apply to subsequent events or transactions that are within the scope of other applicable principles of GAAP that provide different guidance on the accounting treatment for subsequent events or transactions. These requirements were effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. Effective January 1, 2009, we are required to provide enhanced disclosures about our derivative and hedging activities. We are required to provide additional disclosures about (a) how and why we use derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. These requirements did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for the disclosure of these items. 57 Table of Contents Effective January 1, 2009, we are required to treat noncontrolling interests as a separate component of equity, but apart from our equity, and not as a liability or other item outside of equity. We are also required to identify and present consolidated net income attributable to us and to noncontrolling interests on the face of the consolidated statement of income. Previously, we had reported minority interests (noncontrolling interests) as a reduction to operating income. In addition, changes in our ownership interest while we retain a controlling financial interest should be accounted for as equity transactions. We were also required to expand disclosures in the financial statements to include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the equity attributable to us and the noncontrolling owners and a schedule showing the effects of changes in our ownership interest in a subsidiary on the equity attributable to us. This change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements; however, it did change the presentation of minority interests (noncontrolling interests) in our consolidated financial statements. In conjunction with adopting these requirements, we are required to classify securities with redemption features that are not solely within our control such as our noncontrolling interests that are subject to put provisions outside of permanent equity and to measure these noncontrolling interests at fair value. See Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for further details. The consolidated financial statements have been recast for all prior periods presented for the retrospective application of these presentation and disclosure requirements. All business combinations consummated after January 1, 2009, are required to be accounted for under the acquisition method (previously referred to as the purchase method). Under the acquisition method, the acquirer recognizes the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, as well as any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date. Noncontractual contingencies are recognized at the acquisition date at their fair values only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability. Transaction costs are excluded from the acquisition cost and are expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration included by the acquirer as part of the purchase price must also be measured at fair value at the acquisition date and is classified as either equity or a liability. A company that obtains control but acquires less than 100% of an acquiree is required to record 100% of the fair value of the acquiree assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests at the acquisition date. The adoption of these requirements did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2008, the FASB required public entities to provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets and required public enterprises to provide additional disclosures about their involvement in variable interest entities and certain special purpose entities. Because these requirements impact disclosures and not the accounting treatment for transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities, these requirements did not impact our financial condition or results of operations. Effective January 1, 2008, the FASB established a framework for measuring fair value and also required additional disclosures about fair value measurements. These requirements applied to assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. Effective January 1, 2009 the FASB issued additional requirements relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). See note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for the impact of these requirements. The adoption of these requirements relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Effective January 1, 2008, the FASB allows companies the alternative to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis that are currently not required to be measured at fair value. This provision is also designed to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The adoption of this provision did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 58 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2009. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average LIBOR rates in effect for all debt tranches plus margins in effect at the end of 2009 including the economic effects of our swap agreements. Term loan A and revolving line of credit interest rate margins are subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio. The margins currently in effect at December 31, 2009 were 1.50% on all of the outstanding balances under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. For our interest rate swap agreements, the table below presents the notional amounts by contract maturity date and the related interest rate terms of the agreements (to pay fixed rates, and to receive LIBOR). Expected maturity date Total FairValue Averageinterestrate 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 2 $ 1 $ 1 $ 901 $ 1 $ 852 $ 1,758 $ 1,765 6.88 % Variable rate $ 98 $ 67 $ 1,707 $ $ $ $ 1,872 $ 1,829 2.62 % Notionalamount Contract maturity date Payfixed Receivevariable Fairvalue 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 (dollars in millions) Swaps: Pay fixed swaps $ 389 $ 389 $ $ $ $ 3.88% to 4.70% LIBOR $ (10.8 ) Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which include the term loan A and the term loan B, consist of various individual tranches that can range in maturity from one month to twelve months and each specific tranche bears interest at a LIBOR rate that is determined by the maturity of that specific tranche plus an interest rate margin, which is currently 1.50% at December 31, 2009. LIBOR based interest rates are reset as each specific tranche matures and a new tranche is re established and can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions including the credit and capital markets. Any increase in the LIBOR based interest rates on the unhedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2009 will have a negative impact on our overall earnings. As of December 31, 2009, we maintained a total of eight interest rate swap agreements, with amortizing notional amounts totaling $389 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR based variable interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.88% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.78% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the term loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expire in 2010 and require quarterly interest payments. During 2009, we accrued net cash obligations of $17.3 million from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2009, the total fair value of these swaps was a liability of $10.8 million. During 2009, we recorded $8.0 million, net of tax, as an increase to other comprehensive income for amounts reclassified into income, net of swap valuation losses. As of December 31, 2009, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 21% of our variable rate debt and approximately 59% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements, our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 2.63%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50% as of December 31, 2009. 59 Table of Contents Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2009 was 4.86% and as of December 31, 2009 was 4.68%. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $8.5 million, $7.1 million, and $5.5 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk.
