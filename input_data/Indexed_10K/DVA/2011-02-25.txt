The following financial and operating data should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this report. The following table presents selected consolidated financial and operating data for the periods indicated. Effective January 1, 2009, we were required to present consolidated net income attributable to us and to noncontrolling interests on the face of the consolidated statement of income, which changed the presentation of minority interests (noncontrolling interests) in our consolidated statements of income. These consolidated financial results have been recast for all prior periods presented to reflect the retrospective application of adopting these new presentation and disclosure requirements for noncontrolling interests.

Forward looking statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements that do not concern historical facts are forward looking statements and include, among other things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, operating cash flow, estimated tax rates, capital expenditures, the development of new centers and center acquisitions, government and commercial payment rates, revenue estimating risk and the impact of our related level of indebtedness on our financial performance, including earnings per share. These statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements, including, but not limited to, risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, the variability of our cash flows, the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates or changes to the structure of payments under the Medicare ESRD program or other government based programs, including, for example, the implementation of a bundled payment rate system beginning January 2011, which will lower reimbursement for services we provide to Medicare patients, and the impact of health care reform legislation that was enacted in the United States in March 2010, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations, the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies, continued increased competition from large and medium sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us, our ability to complete any acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, or integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire and the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of kidney dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,612 outpatient dialysis centers and approximately 750 hospitals, serving approximately 125,000 patients in 42 states. This represents an approximate 30% market share based upon the number of patients that we serve. In 2010, our overall network of dialysis centers increased by 82 centers primarily as a result of opening new centers and acquisitions and the overall number of patients that we serve increased by approximately 6.0%. Our national scale and size, among other things, allows us to provide industry leading quality care that attracts patients and referring physicians, as well as qualified medical directors, provides our patient base with convenient locations and access to a full range of services and provides us the ability to effectively control certain costs. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three stakeholders our patients, our business partners, and our teammates represents the major driver of our long term performance, although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in 40 our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes as measured by DQI have improved over each of the past three years. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States and generally exceed the dialysis outcome quality indicators of the National Kidney Foundation. In addition, over the past several years our teammate turnover has remained relatively constant, which we believe was a major contributor to our continued clinical performance improvements and also a major driver in our ability to improve productivity in 2010. We will continue to focus on these stakeholders and our clinical outcomes as we believe these are fundamental long term value drivers. Our overall financial performance was solid for 2010 and was characterized by the following as compared to 2009: consolidated revenue growth of approximately 6.0%; an increase of approximately 6.0% in the overall number of treatments that we provided; consolidated operating income growth of approximately 6.0%; and strong operating cash flows of $840 million. However, we believe that 2011 will be more challenging as we implement Medicares new payment system that began in January 2011, in which all ESRD payments will be made under a single bundled payment rate that provides for an annual inflation adjustment based upon a market basket index, less a productivity improvement factor. The new bundled payment rate provides a fixed rate to encompass all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment, including pharmaceuticals that were historically separately reimbursed irrespective of the level of pharmaceuticals administered or additional services performed. Approximately 94% of our 2010 consolidated net operating revenues were derived directly from our dialysis and related lab services business. Approximately 83% of our 2010 dialysis and related lab services revenues were derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in the 1,580 centers that we consolidate. Other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, hospital inpatient hemodialysis services and management and administrative services. These services collectively accounted for the balance of our 2010 dialysis and related lab services revenues. Our other business operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing kidney dialysis services to our network of patients. These consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs and physician services. These services generated approximately $374 million of net operating revenues in 2010, representing an 18% increase as compared to 2009. The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues in 2010 accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated net operating revenues. Operating losses from our ancillary services and strategic initiatives decreased from $12 million in 2009 to $6 million in 2010, primarily as a result of improved profitability in our pharmacy and disease management businesses. We currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives as we work to develop successful new business operations. However, any significant change in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes could result in a write off or an impairment of some or all of our investments, including goodwill, in these strategic initiatives, or could also result in significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are: the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week, as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services; average dialysis revenue per treatment; and the number of laboratory patient tests. 41 The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, which we believe is influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our ability to open and acquire new centers. In 2010, we were able to increase our overall network of patients that we serviced by approximately 6% as compared to 2009. Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in 2010 and prior was primarily driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, and our billing and collecting operations performance. Beginning in 2011, with the implementation of Medicares new single bundled payment rate system, the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals will have a lesser impact on our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment since payment for these pharmaceuticals will be included in the bundled payment. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are significantly higher than Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis revenue per treatment. The percentage of commercial patients covered under contracted plans as compared to commercial patients with out of network providers can also significantly affect our average dialysis revenue per treatment. In 2010, the growth of our government based patients continued to outpace the growth of our commercial patients, which has been a trend that we have experienced for the past two years. We believe the growth in our government based patients is driven primarily by improved mortality and the current economic recession. This trend has negatively impacted our average dialysis revenue per treatment as a result of receiving a larger proportion of our revenue from lower payment rates associated with these additional government based patients. The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010: Revenues Medicare and Medicare assigned plans 57 % Medicaid and Medicaid assigned plans 6 % Other government based programs 3 % Total government based programs 66 % Commercial (including hospital dialysis services) 34 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Government payment rates are principally determined by federal Medicare and state Medicaid policy. These payment rates have historically had limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reduction as federal and state governments face increasing budget pressures. Medicare payment rates for dialysis services through 2008 have not been routinely increased to compensate for the impact of inflation. In July 2008, MIPPA was passed by Congress that provided dialysis providers with an increase in the composite rate of 1.0% that went into effect on January 1, 2009 and an additional 1.0% that went into effect on January 1, 2010. This legislation also changed the way Medicare will pay for dialysis services in 2011. The new payment system also provides for an annual inflation adjustment based upon a market basket index, less a productivity adjustment, beginning in 2012. Also beginning in 2012, the rule provides for up to a 2% annual payment withhold that can be earned back by facilities that meet certain defined clinical performance standards. The new payment system reimburses providers based on a single bundled or average payment for each Medicare treatment provided. This new bundled payment amount is designed to cover all dialysis services which were historically included in the composite rate and all separately billable ESRD services such as pharmaceuticals and laboratory costs. The new bundled payment rate is adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a geographic wage index and certain other factors. This initial 2011 bundled payment rate includes reductions of 2% and 3.1%, respectively, to conform to the provisions of MIPPA and to establish neutrality. Further, there is a 5.94% reduction tied to an expanded list of 42 case mix adjustors which can be earned back based upon the presence of these certain patient characteristics and co modalities at the time of treatment. There are also other provisions which may impact payment including an outlier pool and a low volume facility adjustment. We are now at risk for variations in pharmaceutical utilization since reimbursement is set at a fixed average reimbursement rate. Dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with large payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Our commercial payment rates also include payments for out of network patients that on average are higher than our in network contract rates. In 2010, we were successful in increasing some of our commercial payment rates which contributed to an increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment and helped offset some of the overall decline in our average dialysis revenue per treatment. In 2010, we also entered into several new commercial contracts with certain commercial payors that will primarily pay us a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided to patients covered by the commercial insurance plans. These contracts contain annual escalators and effectively eliminate all payments for out of network patients. We are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors and payors are aggressive in their negotiations. If our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, this would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, if there are sustained or increased job losses in the United States as a result of current economic conditions, or depending upon changes to the healthcare regulatory system, we could experience a decrease in the number of patients under commercial plans. Approximately 26% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were from physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for approximately 18% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. Therefore, in 2010 and prior, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in commercial and governmental payment rates for EPO significantly influenced our revenue. For example, in 2010, the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceutical decreased significantly from 2009, which negatively impacted our average dialysis revenue per treatment. Beginning in January 2011, the majority of our pharmaceuticals will no longer be separately billable as a result of the new Medicare single bundled payment rate system and as a result of some of our new commercial contracts that also implemented single bundled payment rates. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past several years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. In 2010, we continued to upgrade our systems and implemented process changes and will continue to do so in 2011 to effectively capture the necessary patient characteristics and certain other factors under Medicares new bundled payment system. We believe this will help minimize reductions in our reimbursement amounts from Medicare and enhance our overall billing and collection performance associated with our payors. However, as we implement these system upgrades, our collection performance as well as our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment could be negatively impacted. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectability of our billings as of the reporting date based upon our actual historical collection experience. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was approximately $337, $340 and $334 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2010, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment decreased by approximately $3 per treatment primarily due to a decline in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, a decline in the commercial payor mix, partially offset by an increase of 1.0% in the Medicare composite rate and an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. In 2009, the average dialysis 43 and related lab services revenue per treatment increased by approximately $6 per treatment primarily due to a 1.0% increase in the Medicare composite rate, an increase in some our commercial payment rates, an increase in our reimbursement rates for EPO and other pharmaceuticals and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by a decline in the commercial payor mix. Commercial payment rates, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals billed separately, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals under the new Medicare bundled payment rate system including our ability to capture all patient characteristics, and changes in the mix of government and commercial patients may materially impact our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in the future. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals, business infrastructure, including the operating costs of our dialysis centers, and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost variability, such as employee benefit costs and insurance costs. Our average clinical hours per treatment decreased in the last two years, primarily because of continued productivity improvements driven by reduced clinical teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We continue to strive for improved productivity levels, however we may not be able to sustain our 2010 performance as changes in federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. In addition, improvements in the U.S. economy could stimulate additional competition for skilled clinical personnel and result in higher teammate turnover which would adversely affect productivity levels. In 2010 and 2009, we experienced an increase in our clinical labor rates of approximately 2.0% and 2.5%, respectively, as clinical labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. However, in 2010, we were able to initiate certain cost control initiatives to minimize increases in our clinical labor rates. In 2010, we experienced an increase in our EPO costs, which increased by approximately 2%. In addition, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO provides for specific discount pricing and rebates based on a variety of factors including process improvements targets, patient outcome targets and data submission, which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to continue to qualify for discount pricing and rebates. In 2010, we also experienced increases in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new centers opened, and general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of consolidated revenues over the past three years. In 2010, through various cost control initiatives, we were able to control our general and administrative expenses which increased by 0.3% of net operating revenues as compared to 2009. However, this still reflects an increase in the dollar amount of spending related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal matters and supporting the growth in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. We expect that these levels of expenditures on general and administrative expenses in 2011 will increase as we continue to make investments in our long term initiatives, including further investments in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, our investments in international growth opportunities, our investments in improving our information technology and human resources infrastructure and the level of support for our regulatory compliance and legal matters. Outlook for 2011. Because of the uncertainties of operating under the new Medicare bundled payment system and the ongoing uncertainties associated with our payor mix, we will not be providing a specific guidance range for 2011 operating income at this time. However, excluding the impact of our recently announced acquisition of DSI Renal, Inc. that is not expected to close until the second or third quarter of this year, our current projections indicate that 2011 operating income will be flat or modestly down compared to 2010. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks and uncertainties, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment 44 rates or changes to the structure of payments under the Medicare ESRD program or other government based programs, including, for example, the implementation of a bundled payment rate system beginning in January 2011, which will lower reimbursement for services we provide to Medicare patients, and the impact of health care reform legislation that was enacted in the United States in March 2010, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations, the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies, continued increased competition from large and medium sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us, our ability to complete any acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, or integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the cautionary language contained in the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 40 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. Results of operations We operate principally as a dialysis and related lab services business but also operate other ancillary services and strategic initiatives. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs and physician services. The dialysis and related lab services business qualifies as a separately reportable segment and all of the other ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been combined and disclosed in the other segments category. Following is a summary of consolidated operating results for reference in the discussion that follows.

Consolidated net operating revenues Consolidated net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $338 million or approximately 5.5% from 2009. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $281 million, principally due to an increase in the number of treatments, partially offset by a decline of $3 in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, and an increase of approximately $57 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services and from our infusion therapy services. Consolidated net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $449 million or approximately 7.9% from 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $377 million, principally due to an increase in the number of treatments, and an increase of approximately $72 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services, disease management services and from our infusion therapy services. Consolidated operating income Consolidated operating income of $997 million for 2010 increased by approximately $57 million, or 6.1%, from 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue as a result of additional treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions in dialysis and related lab services, partially offset by a decline in our average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3, as described below. Operating income also increased as a result of continued cost control initiatives, improved productivity, overall lower pharmaceutical costs and lower operating losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, partially offset by the negative impact of a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, higher labor costs and increases in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Consolidated operating income of $940 million for 2009 increased by approximately $71 million, or 8.2%, from 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue as a result of non acquired treatment growth in dialysis and related lab services, as well as an increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6 as described below. Operating income also increased as a result of cost control initiatives, improved productivity and lower operating losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, which losses were reduced by approximately $18 million in 2009, partially offset by the negative impact of higher pharmaceutical, labor and benefit costs, and increases in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. 46 Operating segments Dialysis and Related Lab Services Year ended 2010 2009 2008 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, exceptper treatment data) Revenues $ 6,073 $ 5,792 $ 5,415 Segment operating income $ 1,039 $ 994 $ 939 Dialysis treatments 17,992,805 17,010,450 16,217,107 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 57,485 54,433 51,663 Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment $ 337 $ 340 $ 334 Net operating revenues Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $281 million or approximately 4.9% from 2009. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 5.6%, partially offset by a decline in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3, or 0.9%. The increase in the number of treatments was primarily due to an increase in non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. The decline in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2010, as compared to 2009, was primarily due to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals and a decline in the commercial payor mix, partially offset by a 1% increase in the Medicare composite rate and an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $377 million or approximately 7.0% from 2008. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 4.7%, and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6, or 1.9%. The increase in the number of treatments was primarily due to an increase in non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. The increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2009, as compared to 2008, was primarily due to a 1% increase in the Medicare composite rate, an increase in some of our commercial payment rates, an increase in our reimbursement rates for EPO and other pharmaceuticals, and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by a decline in the commercial payor mix. The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues by modality for the year ended December 31, 2010: Revenuepercentages Outpatient hemodialysis centers 83 % Peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis 12 % Hospital inpatient hemodialysis 5 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Approximately 66% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare assigned plans, representing approximately 89% of our total patients. Over the last two years, we have been experiencing growth in our government based patients that has been outpacing the growth in our commercial patients which has negatively impacted our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment. In 2010, approximately 11% of 47 our patients and 34% of our revenues were associated with commercial payors, as compared to 12% and 35%, respectively, for 2009. Less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are due directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 5% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. On average we are paid significantly more for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans than we are for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other government plans such as Medicare assigned plans. Patients covered by commercial health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Nearly all of our net earnings from dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates as established by contract and others of which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule for our out of network patients. If we experience a net overall reduction in our contracted and non contracted commercial rates as a result of these negotiations or restrictions, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors, including our commercial payment rates, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are billed separately, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals under the new Medicare bundled payment rate system, including our ability to capture all patient characteristics, and changes in the mix of government and commercial patients. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and operating costs of the dialysis centers. The dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $232, $235 and $230 for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The $3 decrease in the per treatment costs in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, a decrease in our overall pharmaceutical costs and continued improvements in productivity, partially offset by higher labor rates. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis increased by approximately $5 in 2009 as compared to 2008. The increase in the per treatment costs was primarily attributable to higher labor rates and benefit costs, an increase in pharmaceutical costs, an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by improved productivity. General and administrative expenses. Dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses for the years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $471 million, $428 million and $402 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $43 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to increases in labor costs, an increase in our professional expenses for legal and compliance matters and the timing of certain other expenditures. The increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $26 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to increases in labor and benefit costs, partially offset by the timing of certain other expenditures. Depreciation and amortization. Dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $228 million, $222 million and $210 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $6 million in depreciation and amortization for dialysis and related lab services in 2010 and $12 million in 2009 were primarily due to growth through new center developments and expansions. 48 Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for dialysis and related lab services was 2.8% for 2010, 2.7% for 2009, and 2.6% for 2008. The increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts in 2010 was primarily to reflect a slowdown in the collection of payments from some of our non government payors. The current provision level of 2.8% may increase if we encounter problems with our billing and collection process as a result of sustained weakness in the U.S. economy. Operating income Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2010 increased by approximately $45 million as compared to 2009. The increase in the operating income for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to growth in the number of dialysis treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3 as described above. The dialysis and related lab services operating income also increased as a result of certain cost control initiatives, improved productivity, and overall lower pharmaceutical costs. However, the dialysis and related lab services operating income was negatively impacted primarily by a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, higher labor costs and an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2009 increased by approximately $55 million as compared to 2008. The increase in the operating income for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to growth in the number of dialysis treatments and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6 as described above. The dialysis and related lab services operating income also increased as a result of certain cost control initiatives and improved productivity, but was negatively impacted primarily by higher labor and benefit costs, an increase in pharmaceutical costs and an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Other Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Year ended 2010 2009 2008 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Revenues $ 374 $ 317 $ 245 Segment operating loss $ (6 ) $ (12 ) $ (30 ) Net operating revenues The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $57 million or 18.0% as compared to 2009, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, and from our infusion therapy services, partially offset by a decline in our net operating revenues in our disease management services as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $72 million or 29.5% as compared to 2008, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, disease management services and from our infusion therapy services. Operating expenses Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2010 increased by approximately $51 million from 2009, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business and an increase in labor costs, partially offset by lower operating costs of our disease management services as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2009 increased by approximately $54 million from 2008, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business and an increase in labor and benefit costs, partially offset by lower professional fees. 49 Operating loss Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2010 decreased by approximately $6 million from 2009. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to volume growth in revenues associated with our pharmacy business, and a decrease in operating losses in our disease management business as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2009 decreased by approximately $18 million from 2008. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to volume growth in revenues outpacing increases in operating expenses, primarily associated with our pharmacy business and our disease management business, partially offset by an increase in operating losses associated with certain new initiatives. Corporate level charges Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation of approximately $46 million for 2010 increased by approximately $2 million from 2009. Stock based compensation of approximately $44 million for 2009 increased by approximately $3 million from 2008. The increase in 2010 resulted principally from an increase in the overall grant date fair value for the grant years that contributed expense to 2010, driven in part by a substantial increase in the grant date fair value of 2010 grants over that for recent years offset by a significant reduction in the number of awards granted in 2010. The increase in 2009 resulted from increases in both the aggregate quantity of grants and in the overall grant date fair value for the grant years that contributed expense to 2009. Debt expense. Debt expense for 2010, 2009, and 2008 consisted of interest expense of approximately $172 million, $176 million, and $215 million, respectively, including the amortization and accretion of debt discounts and premiums and the amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $9 million in 2010 and $10 million for 2009 and 2008. The decrease in interest expense in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily related to lower average outstanding principal balances on our previously outstanding Term Loan A, lower average outstanding principal balances on our previously outstanding senior notes, lower interest rates associated with the issuance of our New Senior Notes and a decrease in our weighted average effective interest rate on the Term Loan B as a result of lower notional amounts of fixed rate swap agreements that contained higher rates. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2010 was 4.68% as compared to 4.86% in 2009. However, interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2010 was negatively affected by the refinancing of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities that occurred on October 20, 2010, as the interest rates under our new Senior Secured Credit Facilities are substantially higher than the interest rates under the previous facility. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in the fourth quarter of 2010 was 4.86%. Therefore, we expect our overall interest expense in 2011 will be significantly higher than 2010. The decrease in interest expense in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt and the result of lower notional amounts of fixed rate swap agreements that contained higher rates. As of December 31, 2009, the notional amounts of our fixed rate swaps were approximately $389 million as compared to approximately $790 million at December 31, 2008. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2009 was 4.86% as compared to 5.82% in 2008. Equity investment income. Equity investment income was approximately $9.0 million in 2010 as compared to $2.4 million in 2009. The increase in equity investment income in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the profitability of our nonconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in equity investment income in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to an increase in the number of equity investments and improved profitability at several joint ventures. Other income. Other income was approximately $3 million, $4 million, and $12 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, and consisted principally of interest income. The decreases in other income in 2010 and 2009 were primarily the result of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash balances. 50 Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for 2010 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 35.0%, compared with 36.7% and 35.9% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2010 was lower primarily due to the impact of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and nonrecurring tax benefits associated with closed examinations and statutes. We currently project the effective income tax rate for 2011 to be in the range of 35.0% to 36.0%. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, and our investments in ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that an impairment review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. These types of adjustments are charged directly to the corresponding operating segment that incurred the charge. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. Noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $79 million, $57 million and $47 million, respectively. The increases in noncontrolling interests in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to increases in the number of new joint ventures and increases in the profitability of our dialysis related joint ventures. The percentage of dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues generated from dialysis related joint ventures was approximately 18% in 2010 compared to 16% in 2009. Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2010 and 2009 represented approximately 61 and 68 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt allowance. The relative decrease in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2010 was a result of improved cash collections. However, our cash collections during the first half of 2011 could be negatively impacted as a result of implementing Medicares new single bundled payment rate system. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately $153 million and $201 million in unreserved accounts receivable, respectively, representing approximately 15% and 18% of our total accounts receivable balance, respectively, were more than six months old. During 2010, we experienced improved cash collections from certain government payors and certain commercial payors. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than 1% of our revenues are classified as patient pay. Substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $46 million for both years, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Currently, a significant portion of our Medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. However, the payment received from Medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. Such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements, except for potentially limiting the collectability of these Medicare bad debt claims. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2010, our cash balance was $860 million and we had undrawn credit under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $250 million, of which approximately $46 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows 51 and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2010 amounted to $840 million, compared with $667 million for 2009. The increase in our operating cash flows in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to improved cash earnings and an improvement in our accounts receivable collections as described above. Cash flow from operations in 2010 included cash interest payments of approximately $191 million and cash tax payments of $207 million. Cash flow from operations in 2009 included cash interest payments of $186 million and cash tax payments of $162 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2010 included $279 million for capital asset expenditures, including $120 million for new center developments and relocations, and $159 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $189 million for acquisitions. During 2010, we also received $61 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, we received $60 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $84 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $10 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 8.9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $619 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2009 included $275 million for capital asset expenditures, including $161 million for new center developments and relocations, and $114 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $88 million for acquisitions. During 2009, we also received $33 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, we received $75 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $68 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $13 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 2.9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $154 million. During 2010, we acquired a total of 41 dialysis centers, opened 65 new dialysis centers, sold six centers, closed 18 centers and made minority equity investments in three centers that were previously under management and administrative service agreements. During 2009, we acquired a total of 19 dialysis centers, opened 78 new dialysis centers, sold six centers, closed 18 centers, made minority equity investments in six centers and added two centers under management and administrative service agreements. Acquisition On February 4, 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding equity securities of CDSI I Holding Company, Inc., parent company of dialysis provider DSI Renal, Inc. (DSI), in cash for approximately $689.2 million, subject to among other things, adjustments for certain items such as working capital, the purchase of noncontrolling interests, capital assets and acquisitions expenditures. DSI currently operates approximately 106 outpatient dialysis centers serving approximately 8,000 patients. The transaction is subject to approval by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) including Hart Scott Rodino antitrust clearance. We anticipate that we will be required by the FTC to divest a certain number of outpatient dialysis centers as a condition of the transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of fiscal 2011. 2010 capital structure changes and other items On October 20, 2010, we entered into a $3,000 million new Senior Secured Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), consisting of a five year $250 million revolving line of credit, a five year $1,000 million Term Loan A and a six year $1,750 million Term Loan B. We also have the right to request an increase to the borrowing 52 capacity to a total aggregate principal amount of not more than $4,000 million subject to bank participation. The revolving line of credit and the Term Loan A will initially bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest rate margin of 2.75% until June 30, 2011, and then is subject to adjustment depending upon our leverage ratio and can range from 2.25% to 2.75%. The Term Loan A requires annual principal payments of $50 million in 2011, $50 million in 2012, $100 million in 2013, and $150 million in 2014, with the balance of $650 million due in 2015. The Term Loan B bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.50%) plus 3.00% subject to a ratings based step down to 2.75%. The Term Loan B requires annual principal payments of $17.5 million in each year from 2011 through 2015 with the balance of $1,663 million due in 2016. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of DaVitas and its guarantors assets. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants such as various restrictions on investments, acquisitions, the payment of dividends, redemptions and acquisitions of capital stock, capital expenditures and other indebtedness, as well as limitations on the amount of tangible net assets in non guarantor subsidiaries. However, many of these restrictions will not apply as long as our leverage ratio is below 3.50:1.00. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires compliance with financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio and a leverage ratio that determines the interest rate margins as described above. On October 20, 2010, we also issued $775 million aggregate principal amount of 6 3/8% senior notes due 2018 and $775 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2020 (the New Senior Notes). The New Senior Notes will pay interest on May 1 and November 1, of each year beginning May 1, 2011. The New Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally to other unsecured senior indebtedness. The New Senior Notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. We may redeem some or all of the 6 3/8% senior notes at any time on or after November 1, 2013 at certain redemption prices and may redeem some or all of the 6 5/8% senior notes at any time on or after November 1, 2014 at certain redemption prices. We received total proceeds of $4,300 million from these transactions, $2,750 million from the borrowings on Term Loan A and Term Loan B and an additional $1,550 million from the issuance of the New Senior Notes. We used a portion of the proceeds to pay off the outstanding principal balances of our existing senior secured credit facilities plus accrued interest totaling $1,795 million and to purchase pursuant to a cash tender offer $558 million of the outstanding principal balances of our $700 million 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $731 million of the outstanding balances of our $850 million 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015 (the Existing Notes), plus accrued interest totaling $1,297 million. The total amount paid for the Existing Notes was $1,019.06 per $1,000 principal amount of the 6 5/8% senior notes and $1,038.75 per $1,000 principal amount of the 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes. This resulted in us paying a cash tender premium of $39 million in order to extinguish this portion of the Existing Notes. On November 19, 2010, we redeemed the remaining outstanding balance of the existing 6 5/8% senior notes of $142 million at 101.656% per $1,000 and the remaining outstanding balance of the existing 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes of $119 million at 103.625% per $1,000 plus accrued interest totaling $265 million. In addition, we paid a call premium totaling $7 million. We also paid an additional $74 million in fees, discounts and other expenses. As a result of the above transactions, we received approximately $823 million in excess cash which we intend to use for general purposes and other opportunities, including share repurchases, potential acquisitions and other growth investments. In connection with these transactions, we expensed debt refinancing and redemption charges totaling $70.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, which includes the write off of certain existing deferred financing costs and other new financing costs, the cash tender and call premiums, as described above and other expenses. On June 7, 2010, we redeemed $200 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013, at a price of 101.656% plus accrued interest. As a result of this transaction, we expensed debt redemption charges of $4.1 million, which includes the call premium and the net write off of other finance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010 we made mandatory principal payments totaling $65.6 million on the prior Term Loan A. 53 Interest rate swaps In January 2011, we entered into nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1.0 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan A debt to fixed rates ranging from 1.59% to 1.64%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 4.36% including the Term Loan A margin of 2.75%. The swap agreements expire on September 30, 2014 and require monthly interest payments. In addition, in January 2011, we also entered into five interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling $1.25 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 4.00% on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan B debt. The cap agreements expire on September 30, 2014. Our previous interest rate swap agreements expired on September 30, 2010. The agreements that were effective during 2010 had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 4.05% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.84% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the Term Loan B margin of 1.50%. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we accrued net cash obligations of approximately $9.1 million, $17.3 million and $4.2 million, respectively, from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2010, the interest rates were fixed on approximately 77% of our total debt. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 4.05%, based upon the current margins in effect of 2.75% for the Term Loan A and 3.00% for the Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2010. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2010 was 4.68% and as of December 31, 2010 was 4.94%. Stock repurchases During 2010, we repurchased a total of 8,918,760 shares of our common stock for $618.5 million, or an average price of $69.35 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. On November 3, 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an increase of an additional $800 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions, the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2010 was $682 million. We have not repurchased any additional shares of our common stock from January 1, 2011 through February 25, 2011. This stock repurchase program has no expiration date. Other items On July 22, 2010, we entered into a First Amended and Restated National Service Provider Agreement, or the Agreement, with NxStage Medical Inc., or NxStage. The Agreement supersedes the National Service Provider Agreement that we entered into with NxStage on February 7, 2007. Under terms of the Agreement, we will have the ability to continue to purchase NxStage System One hemodialysis machines and related supplies at discounted prices. In addition, under the Agreement, we may earn warrants to purchase NxStage common stock subject to certain requirements, including our ability to achieve certain System One home patient growth targets. The Agreement provides for a range of warrant amounts that may be earned annually depending upon the achievement of various home patient targets. The maximum amount of shares underlying warrants that we can earn over three years is 5.5 million. The exercise price of the warrants is $14.22 per share. In connection 54 therewith, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement whereby NxStage has agreed to register any shares issued to us under the warrants. The Agreement expires on June 30, 2013, and will be automatically extended on a monthly basis unless terminated by either party pursuant to the Agreement. In July 2010, we announced that we will construct a new corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado. In July 2010, we acquired the land and existing improvements for approximately $12 million. Effective December 18, 2010, we entered into a construction agreement for the construction of the new building. We currently estimate the total construction costs and other project costs of the building will be approximately $95 million. Construction is expected to begin in early 2011, and is estimated to be complete in the second half of 2012. In 2010, we paid architecture and other design costs totaling approximately $5 million. Stock based compensation Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the straight line amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in all prior periods. During 2010, we granted 2,037,294 stock settled stock appreciation rights with a grant date fair value of $32.3 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 3.5 years, and also granted 467,962 stock units with a grant date fair value of $29.4 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 2.5 years. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recognized $45.6 million and $44.4 million, respectively, in stock based compensation expense for stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock options, stock units and discounted employee stock plan purchases, which is primarily included in general and administrative expenses. The estimated tax benefits recorded for this stock based compensation in 2010 and 2009 were $17.3 million and $16.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, there was $83.1 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we received $48.7 million and $63.7 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $26.7 million and $18.2 million, respectively, in total actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. 2009 capital structure changes Term Loan A During 2009, we made mandatory principal payments totaling $61.3 million on our previous Term Loan A. As a result of these principal payments, the outstanding balance on Term Loan A as of December 31, 2009 was $153.1 million and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall weighted average effective rate of 1.74%. The interest rate margin was subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term Loan B As of December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance of our Term Loan B was $1.7 billion and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% for an overall weighted average effective rate of 2.66%, including the impact of our swap agreements that were in effect. We did not make any principal payments on Term Loan B during 2009, nor were we required to. 55 Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes Our senior and senior subordinated notes, as of December 31, 2009, consisted of $900 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes were guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments in March and September. We could redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. All of the outstanding balances under the Term Loan A, Term Loan B and the senior and senior subordinated notes were extinguished as part of our debt refinancing transactions that occurred on October 20, 2010, as described above. Stock repurchases During 2009, we repurchased a total of 2,902,619 shares of our common stock for $153.5 million, or an average price of $52.88 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. On November 3, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an increase of an additional $500 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2009 was $500 million. This stock repurchase program had no expiration date. Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2009, we maintained a total of eight interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $389 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.88% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.78% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the Term Loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expired on September 30, 2010. During 2009, we accrued net cash obligations of approximately $17.3 million from these swaps, which were included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2009, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 21% of our variable rate debt and approximately 59% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements our overall weighted average effective interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 2.63%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, as of December 31, 2009. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2009 was 4.86% and as of December 31, 2009 was 4.68%. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases and letters of credit as well as potential obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated businesses and to dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several joint ventures and for some of our non wholly owned subsidiaries in the form of put provisions. If these put provisions were exercised, we would be required to purchase the third party owners noncontrolling interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the noncontrolling interests put to us, which is intended to approximate fair value. For additional information see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements. 56 We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several other dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties or centers in which we own an equity investment, as well as to physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under management and administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010 (in millions): Less Than1 year 2 3years 4 5years After5 years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 74 $ 186 $ 835 $ 3,214 $ 4,309 Interest payments 104 202 202 379 887 Interest payments on the Term Loan B(1) 96 157 153 61 467 Capital lease obligations 1 2 1 4 8 Operating leases 232 403 326 555 1,516 Construction of the new corporate headquarters 60 30 90 $ 567 $ 980 $ 1,517 $ 4,213 $ 7,277 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 46 $ $ $ $ 46 Noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions 225 67 48 43 383 Operating capital advances 2 2 $ 273 $ 67 $ 48 $ 43 $ 431 (1) Assuming no changes to LIBOR based interest rates as the Term Loan B currently bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.50%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.00%. Not included above are interest payments related to our Term Loan A. The Term Loan A currently bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.75%, for an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 3.02% as of December 31, 2010. The interest rate margin is subject to an adjustment depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios and can range from 2.25% to 2.75%. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific debt tranches within each Term Loan, currently monthly, which can range in maturity from one month to twelve months. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of mandatory principal payments and principal prepayments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no principal prepayments on our Term Loan A during 2011 and no changes in the effective interest rate, including the interest rate margin, approximately $30 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2011 related to the Term Loan A. In addition to the above commitments, we are obligated to purchase a certain amount of our hemodialysis products and supplies at fixed prices through 2015 from Gambro Renal Products, Inc. in connection with the Product Supply Agreement. Our total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs in each year. In January 2010, we entered into an agreement with Fresenius which committed us to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies from them through 2013. Our total expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2010 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs. The actual amount of purchases in future years from Gambro Renal Products and Fresenius will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, and in the case of the Product Supply Agreement, Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. 57 Settlements of approximately $11 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made. Contingencies The information in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements of this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly variable compensation accruals, purchase accounting valuation estimates, fair value estimates and stock based compensation are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Beginning in January 2011, we are also subject to certain variations in our reimbursements from Medicare as we implement Medicares new single bundled payment rate system whereby our reimbursements can be adjusted for certain patient characteristics and certain other factors. Our revenue recognition will depend upon our ability to effectively capture, document and bill for Medicares base payment rate and these other factors. In addition, as a result of the potential range of variations that can occur in our reimbursements from Medicare under the new single bundled payment rate system, our revenue recognition will be subject to a greater degree of estimating risk. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for 58 payments, slow down in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 125,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as 6% of consolidated operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairments of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers or other operations. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year, and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. We are required to assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and to also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain and future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. We make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets, liabilities and contractual as well as non contractual contingencies 59 associated with our acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Fair value estimates. We have recorded certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions at fair value. The FASB defines fair value which is measured based upon certain valuation techniques that include inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. We have measured the fair values of our applicable assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions based upon certain market inputs and assumptions that are either observable or unobservable in determining fair values and have also classified these assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels. The fair value of our investments available for sale are based upon quoted market prices from active markets and the fair value of our swap agreements were based upon valuation models and a variety of techniques as reported by various broker dealers that were based upon relevant observable market inputs such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, and other credit and liquidity market conditions. For our noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions we have estimated the fair values of these based upon either the higher of a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. During the second quarter of 2010, we refined the methodology used to estimate the fair value of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions by eliminating an annual inflation factor that was previously applied to the put provisions until they became exercisable. We believe that eliminating an annual inflation factor will result in a better representation of the estimated actual fair value of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. The estimate of the fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners noncontrolling interests. Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the straight line amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk free interest rates. Significant new accounting standards In August 2010, the FASB issued transition guidance for healthcare entities for measuring charity care that was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. Charity care is defined as healthcare services that are provided but are not expected to result in cash flows where the patients have demonstrated the inability to pay. The guidance requires management to disclose their policy on providing charity care, the level of charity care provided, the measurement of the direct and indirect costs of providing those services, and the amount of any subsidies received for providing charity care. Management can also estimate the costs of those services using reasonable techniques. The guidance shall be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Effective January 1, 2010, the FASB eliminated the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and required additional disclosures about an enterprises involvement in variable interest entities. An entity is required to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity by having both the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact 60 the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity, or the right to receive benefits from the entity. In addition, the FASB established new guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity, requiring an ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and adding an additional reconsideration event for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity when any changes in facts and circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk, as a group, lose the power from voting rights or similar rights of those investments to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of adopting these new requirements. Effective December 15, 2009, FASB amended certain fair value disclosure requirements to include additional disclosures related to significant transfers in and out of the various fair value hierarchy levels and to clarify existing disclosures by providing disaggregate levels for each class of assets and liabilities. We are also required to provide additional disclosures on the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value, as well as changes to the valuation techniques and inputs, for both recurring and nonrecurring assets and liabilities carried at fair value. In addition, we are also required to disclose the reason for making changes to our valuation techniques, assumptions and or other unobservable market inputs. Certain other disclosures on reporting the gross activity rather than the net activity for Level 3 fair value measurements is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2010. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2010. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average LIBOR rates in effect for all debt tranches plus interest rate margins in effect at the end of 2010. The Term Loan A margin currently in effect is 2.75% and along with the revolving line of credit is subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio. The Term Loan B currently bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.50%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.00% subject to a ratings based step down to 2.75%. Expected maturity date Total FairValue Averageinterestrate 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 19 $ 19 $ 19 $ 18 $ 18 $ 3,218 $ 3,311 $ 3,305 5.49 % Variable rate $ 56 $ 50 $ 100 $ 150 $ 650 $ $ 1,006 $ 1,008 3.11 % Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which include the Term Loan A and the Term Loan B, consist of various individual tranches that can range in maturity from one month to twelve months (currently monthly). For the Term Loan A each specific tranche would bear interest at a LIBOR rate that is determined by the maturity of that specific tranche plus an interest rate margin. The LIBOR variable component of the interest rate is reset as each specific tranche matures and a new tranche is re established and can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions including the credit and capital markets. In January 2011, we entered into several interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of fixing all of the Term Loan A LIBOR variable component of our interest rate, as described below. Our Term Loan B is currently effectively fixed since the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate is set at a LIBOR floor of 1.50%. We have included it in the fixed rate totals in the table above until such time as the LIBOR based component of our interest rate exceeds 1.50%. We will then be subject to LIBOR based interest rate volatility on the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate, but only up to 4.00% on $1.25 billion of outstanding principal debt on the Term Loan B, as described below. The remaining $500 million of outstanding debt on the Term Loan B is subject to LIBOR based interest rate volatility above a floor of 1.50%. 61 In January 2011, we entered into nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1.0 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan A debt to fixed rates ranging from 1.59% to 1.64%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 4.36% including the Term Loan A margin of 2.75%. The swap agreements expire on September 30, 2014 and require monthly interest payments. In addition, in January 2011, we also entered into five interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling $1.25 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 4.00% on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan B debt. The cap agreements expire on September 30, 2014. Our previous interest rate swap agreements expired on September 30, 2010. The agreements that were effective during 2010 had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 4.05% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.84% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the Term Loan B margin of 1.50%. During 2010, we accrued net cash obligations of $9.1 million from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2010, the interest rates were fixed on approximately 77% of our total debt. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 4.05%, based upon the current margins in effect of 2.75% for the Term Loan A and 3.00% for the Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2010. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2010 was 4.68% and as of December 31, 2010 was 4.94%. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $11.1 million, $8.5 million, and $7.1 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any significant foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this report. The following table presents selected consolidated financial and operating data for the periods indicated. Effective January 1, 2009, we were required to present consolidated net income attributable to us and to noncontrolling interests on the face of the consolidated statement of income, which changed the presentation of minority interests (noncontrolling interests) in our consolidated statements of income. These consolidated financial results have been recast for all prior periods presented to reflect the retrospective application of adopting these new presentation and disclosure requirements for noncontrolling interests.

(6) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed by dividing earnings by fixed charges. Earnings for this purpose is defined as pretax income from continuing operations adjusted by adding back fixed charges expensed during the period. Fixed charges include debt expense (interest expense and the write off and amortization of deferred financing costs), the estimated interest component of rental expense on operating leases, and capitalized interest. (7) Share repurchases consisted of 8,918,760 shares of common stock for $618,496 in 2010, 2,902,619 shares of common stock for $153,495 in 2009, and 4,788,881 shares of common stock for $232,715 in 2008. Shares issued in connection with stock awards amounted to 1,771,384 in 2010, 2,104,304 in 2009, 1,314,074 in 2008, 2,480,899 in 2007, and 2,620,125 in 2006. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements that do not concern historical facts are forward looking statements and include, among other things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, operating cash flow, estimated tax rates, capital expenditures, the development of new centers and center acquisitions, government and commercial payment rates, revenue estimating risk and the impact of our related level of indebtedness on our financial performance, including earnings per share. These statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements, including, but not limited to, risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, the variability of our cash flows, the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates or changes to the structure of payments under the Medicare ESRD program or other government based programs, including, for example, the implementation of a bundled payment rate system beginning January 2011, which will lower reimbursement for services we provide to Medicare patients, and the impact of health care reform legislation that was enacted in the United States in March 2010, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations, the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies, continued increased competition from large and medium sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us, our ability to complete any acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, or integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire and the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of kidney dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,612 outpatient dialysis centers and approximately 750 hospitals, serving approximately 125,000 patients in 42 states. This represents an approximate 30% market share based upon the number of patients that we serve. In 2010, our overall network of dialysis centers increased by 82 centers primarily as a result of opening new centers and acquisitions and the overall number of patients that we serve increased by approximately 6.0%. Our national scale and size, among other things, allows us to provide industry leading quality care that attracts patients and referring physicians, as well as qualified medical directors, provides our patient base with convenient locations and access to a full range of services and provides us the ability to effectively control certain costs. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three stakeholders our patients, our business partners, and our teammates represents the major driver of our long term performance, although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in 40 our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes as measured by DQI have improved over each of the past three years. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States and generally exceed the dialysis outcome quality indicators of the National Kidney Foundation. In addition, over the past several years our teammate turnover has remained relatively constant, which we believe was a major contributor to our continued clinical performance improvements and also a major driver in our ability to improve productivity in 2010. We will continue to focus on these stakeholders and our clinical outcomes as we believe these are fundamental long term value drivers. Our overall financial performance was solid for 2010 and was characterized by the following as compared to 2009: consolidated revenue growth of approximately 6.0%; an increase of approximately 6.0% in the overall number of treatments that we provided; consolidated operating income growth of approximately 6.0%; and strong operating cash flows of $840 million. However, we believe that 2011 will be more challenging as we implement Medicares new payment system that began in January 2011, in which all ESRD payments will be made under a single bundled payment rate that provides for an annual inflation adjustment based upon a market basket index, less a productivity improvement factor. The new bundled payment rate provides a fixed rate to encompass all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment, including pharmaceuticals that were historically separately reimbursed irrespective of the level of pharmaceuticals administered or additional services performed. Approximately 94% of our 2010 consolidated net operating revenues were derived directly from our dialysis and related lab services business. Approximately 83% of our 2010 dialysis and related lab services revenues were derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in the 1,580 centers that we consolidate. Other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, hospital inpatient hemodialysis services and management and administrative services. These services collectively accounted for the balance of our 2010 dialysis and related lab services revenues. Our other business operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing kidney dialysis services to our network of patients. These consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs and physician services. These services generated approximately $374 million of net operating revenues in 2010, representing an 18% increase as compared to 2009. The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues in 2010 accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated net operating revenues. Operating losses from our ancillary services and strategic initiatives decreased from $12 million in 2009 to $6 million in 2010, primarily as a result of improved profitability in our pharmacy and disease management businesses. We currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives as we work to develop successful new business operations. However, any significant change in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes could result in a write off or an impairment of some or all of our investments, including goodwill, in these strategic initiatives, or could also result in significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are: the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week, as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services; average dialysis revenue per treatment; and the number of laboratory patient tests. 41 The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, which we believe is influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our ability to open and acquire new centers. In 2010, we were able to increase our overall network of patients that we serviced by approximately 6% as compared to 2009. Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in 2010 and prior was primarily driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, and our billing and collecting operations performance. Beginning in 2011, with the implementation of Medicares new single bundled payment rate system, the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals will have a lesser impact on our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment since payment for these pharmaceuticals will be included in the bundled payment. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are significantly higher than Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis revenue per treatment. The percentage of commercial patients covered under contracted plans as compared to commercial patients with out of network providers can also significantly affect our average dialysis revenue per treatment. In 2010, the growth of our government based patients continued to outpace the growth of our commercial patients, which has been a trend that we have experienced for the past two years. We believe the growth in our government based patients is driven primarily by improved mortality and the current economic recession. This trend has negatively impacted our average dialysis revenue per treatment as a result of receiving a larger proportion of our revenue from lower payment rates associated with these additional government based patients. The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010: Revenues Medicare and Medicare assigned plans 57 % Medicaid and Medicaid assigned plans 6 % Other government based programs 3 % Total government based programs 66 % Commercial (including hospital dialysis services) 34 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Government payment rates are principally determined by federal Medicare and state Medicaid policy. These payment rates have historically had limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reduction as federal and state governments face increasing budget pressures. Medicare payment rates for dialysis services through 2008 have not been routinely increased to compensate for the impact of inflation. In July 2008, MIPPA was passed by Congress that provided dialysis providers with an increase in the composite rate of 1.0% that went into effect on January 1, 2009 and an additional 1.0% that went into effect on January 1, 2010. This legislation also changed the way Medicare will pay for dialysis services in 2011. The new payment system also provides for an annual inflation adjustment based upon a market basket index, less a productivity adjustment, beginning in 2012. Also beginning in 2012, the rule provides for up to a 2% annual payment withhold that can be earned back by facilities that meet certain defined clinical performance standards. The new payment system reimburses providers based on a single bundled or average payment for each Medicare treatment provided. This new bundled payment amount is designed to cover all dialysis services which were historically included in the composite rate and all separately billable ESRD services such as pharmaceuticals and laboratory costs. The new bundled payment rate is adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a geographic wage index and certain other factors. This initial 2011 bundled payment rate includes reductions of 2% and 3.1%, respectively, to conform to the provisions of MIPPA and to establish neutrality. Further, there is a 5.94% reduction tied to an expanded list of 42 case mix adjustors which can be earned back based upon the presence of these certain patient characteristics and co modalities at the time of treatment. There are also other provisions which may impact payment including an outlier pool and a low volume facility adjustment. We are now at risk for variations in pharmaceutical utilization since reimbursement is set at a fixed average reimbursement rate. Dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with large payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Our commercial payment rates also include payments for out of network patients that on average are higher than our in network contract rates. In 2010, we were successful in increasing some of our commercial payment rates which contributed to an increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment and helped offset some of the overall decline in our average dialysis revenue per treatment. In 2010, we also entered into several new commercial contracts with certain commercial payors that will primarily pay us a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided to patients covered by the commercial insurance plans. These contracts contain annual escalators and effectively eliminate all payments for out of network patients. We are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors and payors are aggressive in their negotiations. If our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, this would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, if there are sustained or increased job losses in the United States as a result of current economic conditions, or depending upon changes to the healthcare regulatory system, we could experience a decrease in the number of patients under commercial plans. Approximately 26% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were from physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for approximately 18% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. Therefore, in 2010 and prior, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in commercial and governmental payment rates for EPO significantly influenced our revenue. For example, in 2010, the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceutical decreased significantly from 2009, which negatively impacted our average dialysis revenue per treatment. Beginning in January 2011, the majority of our pharmaceuticals will no longer be separately billable as a result of the new Medicare single bundled payment rate system and as a result of some of our new commercial contracts that also implemented single bundled payment rates. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past several years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. In 2010, we continued to upgrade our systems and implemented process changes and will continue to do so in 2011 to effectively capture the necessary patient characteristics and certain other factors under Medicares new bundled payment system. We believe this will help minimize reductions in our reimbursement amounts from Medicare and enhance our overall billing and collection performance associated with our payors. However, as we implement these system upgrades, our collection performance as well as our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment could be negatively impacted. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectability of our billings as of the reporting date based upon our actual historical collection experience. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was approximately $337, $340 and $334 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2010, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment decreased by approximately $3 per treatment primarily due to a decline in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, a decline in the commercial payor mix, partially offset by an increase of 1.0% in the Medicare composite rate and an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. In 2009, the average dialysis 43 and related lab services revenue per treatment increased by approximately $6 per treatment primarily due to a 1.0% increase in the Medicare composite rate, an increase in some our commercial payment rates, an increase in our reimbursement rates for EPO and other pharmaceuticals and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by a decline in the commercial payor mix. Commercial payment rates, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals billed separately, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals under the new Medicare bundled payment rate system including our ability to capture all patient characteristics, and changes in the mix of government and commercial patients may materially impact our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in the future. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals, business infrastructure, including the operating costs of our dialysis centers, and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost variability, such as employee benefit costs and insurance costs. Our average clinical hours per treatment decreased in the last two years, primarily because of continued productivity improvements driven by reduced clinical teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We continue to strive for improved productivity levels, however we may not be able to sustain our 2010 performance as changes in federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. In addition, improvements in the U.S. economy could stimulate additional competition for skilled clinical personnel and result in higher teammate turnover which would adversely affect productivity levels. In 2010 and 2009, we experienced an increase in our clinical labor rates of approximately 2.0% and 2.5%, respectively, as clinical labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. However, in 2010, we were able to initiate certain cost control initiatives to minimize increases in our clinical labor rates. In 2010, we experienced an increase in our EPO costs, which increased by approximately 2%. In addition, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO provides for specific discount pricing and rebates based on a variety of factors including process improvements targets, patient outcome targets and data submission, which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to continue to qualify for discount pricing and rebates. In 2010, we also experienced increases in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new centers opened, and general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of consolidated revenues over the past three years. In 2010, through various cost control initiatives, we were able to control our general and administrative expenses which increased by 0.3% of net operating revenues as compared to 2009. However, this still reflects an increase in the dollar amount of spending related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal matters and supporting the growth in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. We expect that these levels of expenditures on general and administrative expenses in 2011 will increase as we continue to make investments in our long term initiatives, including further investments in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, our investments in international growth opportunities, our investments in improving our information technology and human resources infrastructure and the level of support for our regulatory compliance and legal matters. Outlook for 2011. Because of the uncertainties of operating under the new Medicare bundled payment system and the ongoing uncertainties associated with our payor mix, we will not be providing a specific guidance range for 2011 operating income at this time. However, excluding the impact of our recently announced acquisition of DSI Renal, Inc. that is not expected to close until the second or third quarter of this year, our current projections indicate that 2011 operating income will be flat or modestly down compared to 2010. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks and uncertainties, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment 44 rates or changes to the structure of payments under the Medicare ESRD program or other government based programs, including, for example, the implementation of a bundled payment rate system beginning in January 2011, which will lower reimbursement for services we provide to Medicare patients, and the impact of health care reform legislation that was enacted in the United States in March 2010, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations, the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies, continued increased competition from large and medium sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us, our ability to complete any acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, or integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the cautionary language contained in the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 40 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. Results of operations We operate principally as a dialysis and related lab services business but also operate other ancillary services and strategic initiatives. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs and physician services. The dialysis and related lab services business qualifies as a separately reportable segment and all of the other ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been combined and disclosed in the other segments category. Following is a summary of consolidated operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. Year ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 6,447 100 % $ 6,109 100 % $ 5,660 100 % Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 4,475 69 % 4,249 70 % 3,920 69 % General and administrative 579 9 % 532 9 % 508 9 % Depreciation and amortization 234 4 % 229 4 % 217 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 171 3 % 162 3 % 146 3 % Equity investment income (9 ) (2 ) (1 ) Total operating expenses and charges 5,450 84 % 5,169 85 % 4,791 85 % Operating income $ 997 16 % $ 940 15 % $ 869 15 % The following table summarizes consolidated net operating revenues: Year ended 2010 2009 2008 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 6,073 $ 5,792 $ 5,415 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives 374 317 245 Consolidated net operating revenues $ 6,447 $ 6,109 $ 5,660 45 The following table summarizes consolidated operating income: Year ended 2010 2009(1) 2008(1) (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 1,039 $ 994 $ 939 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives loss (6 ) (12 ) (30 ) Total segment operating income 1,034 982 910 Reconciling items: Stock based compensation (46 ) (44 ) (41 ) Equity investment income 9 2 1 Consolidated operating income 997 940 869 (1) Certain costs previously reported in ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been reclassified to dialysis and related lab services to conform to the current year presentation. Consolidated net operating revenues Consolidated net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $338 million or approximately 5.5% from 2009. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $281 million, principally due to an increase in the number of treatments, partially offset by a decline of $3 in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, and an increase of approximately $57 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services and from our infusion therapy services. Consolidated net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $449 million or approximately 7.9% from 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $377 million, principally due to an increase in the number of treatments, and an increase of approximately $72 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services, disease management services and from our infusion therapy services. Consolidated operating income Consolidated operating income of $997 million for 2010 increased by approximately $57 million, or 6.1%, from 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue as a result of additional treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions in dialysis and related lab services, partially offset by a decline in our average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3, as described below. Operating income also increased as a result of continued cost control initiatives, improved productivity, overall lower pharmaceutical costs and lower operating losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, partially offset by the negative impact of a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, higher labor costs and increases in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Consolidated operating income of $940 million for 2009 increased by approximately $71 million, or 8.2%, from 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue as a result of non acquired treatment growth in dialysis and related lab services, as well as an increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6 as described below. Operating income also increased as a result of cost control initiatives, improved productivity and lower operating losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, which losses were reduced by approximately $18 million in 2009, partially offset by the negative impact of higher pharmaceutical, labor and benefit costs, and increases in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. 46 Operating segments Dialysis and Related Lab Services Year ended 2010 2009 2008 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, exceptper treatment data) Revenues $ 6,073 $ 5,792 $ 5,415 Segment operating income $ 1,039 $ 994 $ 939 Dialysis treatments 17,992,805 17,010,450 16,217,107 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 57,485 54,433 51,663 Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment $ 337 $ 340 $ 334 Net operating revenues Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $281 million or approximately 4.9% from 2009. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 5.6%, partially offset by a decline in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3, or 0.9%. The increase in the number of treatments was primarily due to an increase in non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. The decline in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2010, as compared to 2009, was primarily due to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals and a decline in the commercial payor mix, partially offset by a 1% increase in the Medicare composite rate and an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $377 million or approximately 7.0% from 2008. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 4.7%, and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6, or 1.9%. The increase in the number of treatments was primarily due to an increase in non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. The increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2009, as compared to 2008, was primarily due to a 1% increase in the Medicare composite rate, an increase in some of our commercial payment rates, an increase in our reimbursement rates for EPO and other pharmaceuticals, and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by a decline in the commercial payor mix. The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues by modality for the year ended December 31, 2010: Revenuepercentages Outpatient hemodialysis centers 83 % Peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis 12 % Hospital inpatient hemodialysis 5 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Approximately 66% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare assigned plans, representing approximately 89% of our total patients. Over the last two years, we have been experiencing growth in our government based patients that has been outpacing the growth in our commercial patients which has negatively impacted our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment. In 2010, approximately 11% of 47 our patients and 34% of our revenues were associated with commercial payors, as compared to 12% and 35%, respectively, for 2009. Less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are due directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 5% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. On average we are paid significantly more for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans than we are for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other government plans such as Medicare assigned plans. Patients covered by commercial health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Nearly all of our net earnings from dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates as established by contract and others of which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule for our out of network patients. If we experience a net overall reduction in our contracted and non contracted commercial rates as a result of these negotiations or restrictions, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors, including our commercial payment rates, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are billed separately, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals under the new Medicare bundled payment rate system, including our ability to capture all patient characteristics, and changes in the mix of government and commercial patients. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and operating costs of the dialysis centers. The dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $232, $235 and $230 for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The $3 decrease in the per treatment costs in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, a decrease in our overall pharmaceutical costs and continued improvements in productivity, partially offset by higher labor rates. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis increased by approximately $5 in 2009 as compared to 2008. The increase in the per treatment costs was primarily attributable to higher labor rates and benefit costs, an increase in pharmaceutical costs, an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by improved productivity. General and administrative expenses. Dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses for the years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $471 million, $428 million and $402 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $43 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to increases in labor costs, an increase in our professional expenses for legal and compliance matters and the timing of certain other expenditures. The increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $26 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to increases in labor and benefit costs, partially offset by the timing of certain other expenditures. Depreciation and amortization. Dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $228 million, $222 million and $210 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $6 million in depreciation and amortization for dialysis and related lab services in 2010 and $12 million in 2009 were primarily due to growth through new center developments and expansions. 48 Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for dialysis and related lab services was 2.8% for 2010, 2.7% for 2009, and 2.6% for 2008. The increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts in 2010 was primarily to reflect a slowdown in the collection of payments from some of our non government payors. The current provision level of 2.8% may increase if we encounter problems with our billing and collection process as a result of sustained weakness in the U.S. economy. Operating income Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2010 increased by approximately $45 million as compared to 2009. The increase in the operating income for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to growth in the number of dialysis treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3 as described above. The dialysis and related lab services operating income also increased as a result of certain cost control initiatives, improved productivity, and overall lower pharmaceutical costs. However, the dialysis and related lab services operating income was negatively impacted primarily by a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, higher labor costs and an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2009 increased by approximately $55 million as compared to 2008. The increase in the operating income for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to growth in the number of dialysis treatments and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6 as described above. The dialysis and related lab services operating income also increased as a result of certain cost control initiatives and improved productivity, but was negatively impacted primarily by higher labor and benefit costs, an increase in pharmaceutical costs and an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Other Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Year ended 2010 2009 2008 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Revenues $ 374 $ 317 $ 245 Segment operating loss $ (6 ) $ (12 ) $ (30 ) Net operating revenues The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $57 million or 18.0% as compared to 2009, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, and from our infusion therapy services, partially offset by a decline in our net operating revenues in our disease management services as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $72 million or 29.5% as compared to 2008, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, disease management services and from our infusion therapy services. Operating expenses Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2010 increased by approximately $51 million from 2009, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business and an increase in labor costs, partially offset by lower operating costs of our disease management services as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2009 increased by approximately $54 million from 2008, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business and an increase in labor and benefit costs, partially offset by lower professional fees. 49 Operating loss Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2010 decreased by approximately $6 million from 2009. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to volume growth in revenues associated with our pharmacy business, and a decrease in operating losses in our disease management business as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2009 decreased by approximately $18 million from 2008. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to volume growth in revenues outpacing increases in operating expenses, primarily associated with our pharmacy business and our disease management business, partially offset by an increase in operating losses associated with certain new initiatives. Corporate level charges Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation of approximately $46 million for 2010 increased by approximately $2 million from 2009. Stock based compensation of approximately $44 million for 2009 increased by approximately $3 million from 2008. The increase in 2010 resulted principally from an increase in the overall grant date fair value for the grant years that contributed expense to 2010, driven in part by a substantial increase in the grant date fair value of 2010 grants over that for recent years offset by a significant reduction in the number of awards granted in 2010. The increase in 2009 resulted from increases in both the aggregate quantity of grants and in the overall grant date fair value for the grant years that contributed expense to 2009. Debt expense. Debt expense for 2010, 2009, and 2008 consisted of interest expense of approximately $172 million, $176 million, and $215 million, respectively, including the amortization and accretion of debt discounts and premiums and the amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $9 million in 2010 and $10 million for 2009 and 2008. The decrease in interest expense in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily related to lower average outstanding principal balances on our previously outstanding Term Loan A, lower average outstanding principal balances on our previously outstanding senior notes, lower interest rates associated with the issuance of our New Senior Notes and a decrease in our weighted average effective interest rate on the Term Loan B as a result of lower notional amounts of fixed rate swap agreements that contained higher rates. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2010 was 4.68% as compared to 4.86% in 2009. However, interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2010 was negatively affected by the refinancing of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities that occurred on October 20, 2010, as the interest rates under our new Senior Secured Credit Facilities are substantially higher than the interest rates under the previous facility. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in the fourth quarter of 2010 was 4.86%. Therefore, we expect our overall interest expense in 2011 will be significantly higher than 2010. The decrease in interest expense in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt and the result of lower notional amounts of fixed rate swap agreements that contained higher rates. As of December 31, 2009, the notional amounts of our fixed rate swaps were approximately $389 million as compared to approximately $790 million at December 31, 2008. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2009 was 4.86% as compared to 5.82% in 2008. Equity investment income. Equity investment income was approximately $9.0 million in 2010 as compared to $2.4 million in 2009. The increase in equity investment income in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the profitability of our nonconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in equity investment income in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to an increase in the number of equity investments and improved profitability at several joint ventures. Other income. Other income was approximately $3 million, $4 million, and $12 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, and consisted principally of interest income. The decreases in other income in 2010 and 2009 were primarily the result of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash balances. 50 Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for 2010 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 35.0%, compared with 36.7% and 35.9% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2010 was lower primarily due to the impact of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and nonrecurring tax benefits associated with closed examinations and statutes. We currently project the effective income tax rate for 2011 to be in the range of 35.0% to 36.0%. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, and our investments in ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that an impairment review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. These types of adjustments are charged directly to the corresponding operating segment that incurred the charge. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. Noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $79 million, $57 million and $47 million, respectively. The increases in noncontrolling interests in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to increases in the number of new joint ventures and increases in the profitability of our dialysis related joint ventures. The percentage of dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues generated from dialysis related joint ventures was approximately 18% in 2010 compared to 16% in 2009. Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2010 and 2009 represented approximately 61 and 68 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt allowance. The relative decrease in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2010 was a result of improved cash collections. However, our cash collections during the first half of 2011 could be negatively impacted as a result of implementing Medicares new single bundled payment rate system. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately $153 million and $201 million in unreserved accounts receivable, respectively, representing approximately 15% and 18% of our total accounts receivable balance, respectively, were more than six months old. During 2010, we experienced improved cash collections from certain government payors and certain commercial payors. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than 1% of our revenues are classified as patient pay. Substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $46 million for both years, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Currently, a significant portion of our Medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. However, the payment received from Medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. Such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements, except for potentially limiting the collectability of these Medicare bad debt claims. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2010, our cash balance was $860 million and we had undrawn credit under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $250 million, of which approximately $46 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows 51 and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2010 amounted to $840 million, compared with $667 million for 2009. The increase in our operating cash flows in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to improved cash earnings and an improvement in our accounts receivable collections as described above. Cash flow from operations in 2010 included cash interest payments of approximately $191 million and cash tax payments of $207 million. Cash flow from operations in 2009 included cash interest payments of $186 million and cash tax payments of $162 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2010 included $279 million for capital asset expenditures, including $120 million for new center developments and relocations, and $159 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $189 million for acquisitions. During 2010, we also received $61 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, we received $60 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $84 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $10 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 8.9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $619 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2009 included $275 million for capital asset expenditures, including $161 million for new center developments and relocations, and $114 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $88 million for acquisitions. During 2009, we also received $33 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, we received $75 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $68 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $13 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 2.9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $154 million. During 2010, we acquired a total of 41 dialysis centers, opened 65 new dialysis centers, sold six centers, closed 18 centers and made minority equity investments in three centers that were previously under management and administrative service agreements. During 2009, we acquired a total of 19 dialysis centers, opened 78 new dialysis centers, sold six centers, closed 18 centers, made minority equity investments in six centers and added two centers under management and administrative service agreements. Acquisition On February 4, 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding equity securities of CDSI I Holding Company, Inc., parent company of dialysis provider DSI Renal, Inc. (DSI), in cash for approximately $689.2 million, subject to among other things, adjustments for certain items such as working capital, the purchase of noncontrolling interests, capital assets and acquisitions expenditures. DSI currently operates approximately 106 outpatient dialysis centers serving approximately 8,000 patients. The transaction is subject to approval by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) including Hart Scott Rodino antitrust clearance. We anticipate that we will be required by the FTC to divest a certain number of outpatient dialysis centers as a condition of the transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of fiscal 2011. 2010 capital structure changes and other items On October 20, 2010, we entered into a $3,000 million new Senior Secured Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), consisting of a five year $250 million revolving line of credit, a five year $1,000 million Term Loan A and a six year $1,750 million Term Loan B. We also have the right to request an increase to the borrowing 52 capacity to a total aggregate principal amount of not more than $4,000 million subject to bank participation. The revolving line of credit and the Term Loan A will initially bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest rate margin of 2.75% until June 30, 2011, and then is subject to adjustment depending upon our leverage ratio and can range from 2.25% to 2.75%. The Term Loan A requires annual principal payments of $50 million in 2011, $50 million in 2012, $100 million in 2013, and $150 million in 2014, with the balance of $650 million due in 2015. The Term Loan B bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.50%) plus 3.00% subject to a ratings based step down to 2.75%. The Term Loan B requires annual principal payments of $17.5 million in each year from 2011 through 2015 with the balance of $1,663 million due in 2016. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of DaVitas and its guarantors assets. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants such as various restrictions on investments, acquisitions, the payment of dividends, redemptions and acquisitions of capital stock, capital expenditures and other indebtedness, as well as limitations on the amount of tangible net assets in non guarantor subsidiaries. However, many of these restrictions will not apply as long as our leverage ratio is below 3.50:1.00. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires compliance with financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio and a leverage ratio that determines the interest rate margins as described above. On October 20, 2010, we also issued $775 million aggregate principal amount of 6 3/8% senior notes due 2018 and $775 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2020 (the New Senior Notes). The New Senior Notes will pay interest on May 1 and November 1, of each year beginning May 1, 2011. The New Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally to other unsecured senior indebtedness. The New Senior Notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. We may redeem some or all of the 6 3/8% senior notes at any time on or after November 1, 2013 at certain redemption prices and may redeem some or all of the 6 5/8% senior notes at any time on or after November 1, 2014 at certain redemption prices. We received total proceeds of $4,300 million from these transactions, $2,750 million from the borrowings on Term Loan A and Term Loan B and an additional $1,550 million from the issuance of the New Senior Notes. We used a portion of the proceeds to pay off the outstanding principal balances of our existing senior secured credit facilities plus accrued interest totaling $1,795 million and to purchase pursuant to a cash tender offer $558 million of the outstanding principal balances of our $700 million 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $731 million of the outstanding balances of our $850 million 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015 (the Existing Notes), plus accrued interest totaling $1,297 million. The total amount paid for the Existing Notes was $1,019.06 per $1,000 principal amount of the 6 5/8% senior notes and $1,038.75 per $1,000 principal amount of the 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes. This resulted in us paying a cash tender premium of $39 million in order to extinguish this portion of the Existing Notes. On November 19, 2010, we redeemed the remaining outstanding balance of the existing 6 5/8% senior notes of $142 million at 101.656% per $1,000 and the remaining outstanding balance of the existing 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes of $119 million at 103.625% per $1,000 plus accrued interest totaling $265 million. In addition, we paid a call premium totaling $7 million. We also paid an additional $74 million in fees, discounts and other expenses. As a result of the above transactions, we received approximately $823 million in excess cash which we intend to use for general purposes and other opportunities, including share repurchases, potential acquisitions and other growth investments. In connection with these transactions, we expensed debt refinancing and redemption charges totaling $70.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, which includes the write off of certain existing deferred financing costs and other new financing costs, the cash tender and call premiums, as described above and other expenses. On June 7, 2010, we redeemed $200 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013, at a price of 101.656% plus accrued interest. As a result of this transaction, we expensed debt redemption charges of $4.1 million, which includes the call premium and the net write off of other finance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010 we made mandatory principal payments totaling $65.6 million on the prior Term Loan A. 53 Interest rate swaps In January 2011, we entered into nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1.0 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan A debt to fixed rates ranging from 1.59% to 1.64%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 4.36% including the Term Loan A margin of 2.75%. The swap agreements expire on September 30, 2014 and require monthly interest payments. In addition, in January 2011, we also entered into five interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling $1.25 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 4.00% on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan B debt. The cap agreements expire on September 30, 2014. Our previous interest rate swap agreements expired on September 30, 2010. The agreements that were effective during 2010 had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 4.05% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.84% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the Term Loan B margin of 1.50%. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we accrued net cash obligations of approximately $9.1 million, $17.3 million and $4.2 million, respectively, from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2010, the interest rates were fixed on approximately 77% of our total debt. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 4.05%, based upon the current margins in effect of 2.75% for the Term Loan A and 3.00% for the Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2010. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2010 was 4.68% and as of December 31, 2010 was 4.94%. Stock repurchases During 2010, we repurchased a total of 8,918,760 shares of our common stock for $618.5 million, or an average price of $69.35 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. On November 3, 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an increase of an additional $800 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions, the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2010 was $682 million. We have not repurchased any additional shares of our common stock from January 1, 2011 through February 25, 2011. This stock repurchase program has no expiration date. Other items On July 22, 2010, we entered into a First Amended and Restated National Service Provider Agreement, or the Agreement, with NxStage Medical Inc., or NxStage. The Agreement supersedes the National Service Provider Agreement that we entered into with NxStage on February 7, 2007. Under terms of the Agreement, we will have the ability to continue to purchase NxStage System One hemodialysis machines and related supplies at discounted prices. In addition, under the Agreement, we may earn warrants to purchase NxStage common stock subject to certain requirements, including our ability to achieve certain System One home patient growth targets. The Agreement provides for a range of warrant amounts that may be earned annually depending upon the achievement of various home patient targets. The maximum amount of shares underlying warrants that we can earn over three years is 5.5 million. The exercise price of the warrants is $14.22 per share. In connection 54 therewith, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement whereby NxStage has agreed to register any shares issued to us under the warrants. The Agreement expires on June 30, 2013, and will be automatically extended on a monthly basis unless terminated by either party pursuant to the Agreement. In July 2010, we announced that we will construct a new corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado. In July 2010, we acquired the land and existing improvements for approximately $12 million. Effective December 18, 2010, we entered into a construction agreement for the construction of the new building. We currently estimate the total construction costs and other project costs of the building will be approximately $95 million. Construction is expected to begin in early 2011, and is estimated to be complete in the second half of 2012. In 2010, we paid architecture and other design costs totaling approximately $5 million. Stock based compensation Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the straight line amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in all prior periods. During 2010, we granted 2,037,294 stock settled stock appreciation rights with a grant date fair value of $32.3 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 3.5 years, and also granted 467,962 stock units with a grant date fair value of $29.4 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 2.5 years. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recognized $45.6 million and $44.4 million, respectively, in stock based compensation expense for stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock options, stock units and discounted employee stock plan purchases, which is primarily included in general and administrative expenses. The estimated tax benefits recorded for this stock based compensation in 2010 and 2009 were $17.3 million and $16.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, there was $83.1 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we received $48.7 million and $63.7 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $26.7 million and $18.2 million, respectively, in total actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. 2009 capital structure changes Term Loan A During 2009, we made mandatory principal payments totaling $61.3 million on our previous Term Loan A. As a result of these principal payments, the outstanding balance on Term Loan A as of December 31, 2009 was $153.1 million and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall weighted average effective rate of 1.74%. The interest rate margin was subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term Loan B As of December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance of our Term Loan B was $1.7 billion and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% for an overall weighted average effective rate of 2.66%, including the impact of our swap agreements that were in effect. We did not make any principal payments on Term Loan B during 2009, nor were we required to. 55 Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes Our senior and senior subordinated notes, as of December 31, 2009, consisted of $900 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes were guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments in March and September. We could redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. All of the outstanding balances under the Term Loan A, Term Loan B and the senior and senior subordinated notes were extinguished as part of our debt refinancing transactions that occurred on October 20, 2010, as described above. Stock repurchases During 2009, we repurchased a total of 2,902,619 shares of our common stock for $153.5 million, or an average price of $52.88 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. On November 3, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an increase of an additional $500 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2009 was $500 million. This stock repurchase program had no expiration date. Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2009, we maintained a total of eight interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $389 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.88% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.78% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the Term Loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expired on September 30, 2010. During 2009, we accrued net cash obligations of approximately $17.3 million from these swaps, which were included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2009, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 21% of our variable rate debt and approximately 59% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements our overall weighted average effective interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 2.63%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, as of December 31, 2009. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2009 was 4.86% and as of December 31, 2009 was 4.68%. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases and letters of credit as well as potential obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated businesses and to dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several joint ventures and for some of our non wholly owned subsidiaries in the form of put provisions. If these put provisions were exercised, we would be required to purchase the third party owners noncontrolling interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the noncontrolling interests put to us, which is intended to approximate fair value. For additional information see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements. 56 We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several other dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties or centers in which we own an equity investment, as well as to physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under management and administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010 (in millions): Less Than1 year 2 3years 4 5years After5 years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 74 $ 186 $ 835 $ 3,214 $ 4,309 Interest payments 104 202 202 379 887 Interest payments on the Term Loan B(1) 96 157 153 61 467 Capital lease obligations 1 2 1 4 8 Operating leases 232 403 326 555 1,516 Construction of the new corporate headquarters 60 30 90 $ 567 $ 980 $ 1,517 $ 4,213 $ 7,277 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 46 $ $ $ $ 46 Noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions 225 67 48 43 383 Operating capital advances 2 2 $ 273 $ 67 $ 48 $ 43 $ 431 (1) Assuming no changes to LIBOR based interest rates as the Term Loan B currently bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.50%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.00%. Not included above are interest payments related to our Term Loan A. The Term Loan A currently bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.75%, for an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 3.02% as of December 31, 2010. The interest rate margin is subject to an adjustment depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios and can range from 2.25% to 2.75%. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific debt tranches within each Term Loan, currently monthly, which can range in maturity from one month to twelve months. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of mandatory principal payments and principal prepayments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no principal prepayments on our Term Loan A during 2011 and no changes in the effective interest rate, including the interest rate margin, approximately $30 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2011 related to the Term Loan A. In addition to the above commitments, we are obligated to purchase a certain amount of our hemodialysis products and supplies at fixed prices through 2015 from Gambro Renal Products, Inc. in connection with the Product Supply Agreement. Our total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs in each year. In January 2010, we entered into an agreement with Fresenius which committed us to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies from them through 2013. Our total expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2010 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs. The actual amount of purchases in future years from Gambro Renal Products and Fresenius will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, and in the case of the Product Supply Agreement, Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. 57 Settlements of approximately $11 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made. Contingencies The information in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements of this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly variable compensation accruals, purchase accounting valuation estimates, fair value estimates and stock based compensation are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Beginning in January 2011, we are also subject to certain variations in our reimbursements from Medicare as we implement Medicares new single bundled payment rate system whereby our reimbursements can be adjusted for certain patient characteristics and certain other factors. Our revenue recognition will depend upon our ability to effectively capture, document and bill for Medicares base payment rate and these other factors. In addition, as a result of the potential range of variations that can occur in our reimbursements from Medicare under the new single bundled payment rate system, our revenue recognition will be subject to a greater degree of estimating risk. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for 58 payments, slow down in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 125,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as 6% of consolidated operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairments of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers or other operations. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year, and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. We are required to assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and to also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain and future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. We make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets, liabilities and contractual as well as non contractual contingencies 59 associated with our acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Fair value estimates. We have recorded certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions at fair value. The FASB defines fair value which is measured based upon certain valuation techniques that include inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. We have measured the fair values of our applicable assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions based upon certain market inputs and assumptions that are either observable or unobservable in determining fair values and have also classified these assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels. The fair value of our investments available for sale are based upon quoted market prices from active markets and the fair value of our swap agreements were based upon valuation models and a variety of techniques as reported by various broker dealers that were based upon relevant observable market inputs such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, and other credit and liquidity market conditions. For our noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions we have estimated the fair values of these based upon either the higher of a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. During the second quarter of 2010, we refined the methodology used to estimate the fair value of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions by eliminating an annual inflation factor that was previously applied to the put provisions until they became exercisable. We believe that eliminating an annual inflation factor will result in a better representation of the estimated actual fair value of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. The estimate of the fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners noncontrolling interests. Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the straight line amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk free interest rates. Significant new accounting standards In August 2010, the FASB issued transition guidance for healthcare entities for measuring charity care that was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. Charity care is defined as healthcare services that are provided but are not expected to result in cash flows where the patients have demonstrated the inability to pay. The guidance requires management to disclose their policy on providing charity care, the level of charity care provided, the measurement of the direct and indirect costs of providing those services, and the amount of any subsidies received for providing charity care. Management can also estimate the costs of those services using reasonable techniques. The guidance shall be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Effective January 1, 2010, the FASB eliminated the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and required additional disclosures about an enterprises involvement in variable interest entities. An entity is required to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity by having both the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact 60 the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity, or the right to receive benefits from the entity. In addition, the FASB established new guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity, requiring an ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and adding an additional reconsideration event for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity when any changes in facts and circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk, as a group, lose the power from voting rights or similar rights of those investments to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of adopting these new requirements. Effective December 15, 2009, FASB amended certain fair value disclosure requirements to include additional disclosures related to significant transfers in and out of the various fair value hierarchy levels and to clarify existing disclosures by providing disaggregate levels for each class of assets and liabilities. We are also required to provide additional disclosures on the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value, as well as changes to the valuation techniques and inputs, for both recurring and nonrecurring assets and liabilities carried at fair value. In addition, we are also required to disclose the reason for making changes to our valuation techniques, assumptions and or other unobservable market inputs. Certain other disclosures on reporting the gross activity rather than the net activity for Level 3 fair value measurements is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2010. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2010. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average LIBOR rates in effect for all debt tranches plus interest rate margins in effect at the end of 2010. The Term Loan A margin currently in effect is 2.75% and along with the revolving line of credit is subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio. The Term Loan B currently bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.50%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.00% subject to a ratings based step down to 2.75%. Expected maturity date Total FairValue Averageinterestrate 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 19 $ 19 $ 19 $ 18 $ 18 $ 3,218 $ 3,311 $ 3,305 5.49 % Variable rate $ 56 $ 50 $ 100 $ 150 $ 650 $ $ 1,006 $ 1,008 3.11 % Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which include the Term Loan A and the Term Loan B, consist of various individual tranches that can range in maturity from one month to twelve months (currently monthly). For the Term Loan A each specific tranche would bear interest at a LIBOR rate that is determined by the maturity of that specific tranche plus an interest rate margin. The LIBOR variable component of the interest rate is reset as each specific tranche matures and a new tranche is re established and can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions including the credit and capital markets. In January 2011, we entered into several interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of fixing all of the Term Loan A LIBOR variable component of our interest rate, as described below. Our Term Loan B is currently effectively fixed since the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate is set at a LIBOR floor of 1.50%. We have included it in the fixed rate totals in the table above until such time as the LIBOR based component of our interest rate exceeds 1.50%. We will then be subject to LIBOR based interest rate volatility on the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate, but only up to 4.00% on $1.25 billion of outstanding principal debt on the Term Loan B, as described below. The remaining $500 million of outstanding debt on the Term Loan B is subject to LIBOR based interest rate volatility above a floor of 1.50%. 61 In January 2011, we entered into nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1.0 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan A debt to fixed rates ranging from 1.59% to 1.64%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 4.36% including the Term Loan A margin of 2.75%. The swap agreements expire on September 30, 2014 and require monthly interest payments. In addition, in January 2011, we also entered into five interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling $1.25 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 4.00% on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan B debt. The cap agreements expire on September 30, 2014. Our previous interest rate swap agreements expired on September 30, 2010. The agreements that were effective during 2010 had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 4.05% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.84% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the Term Loan B margin of 1.50%. During 2010, we accrued net cash obligations of $9.1 million from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2010, the interest rates were fixed on approximately 77% of our total debt. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 4.05%, based upon the current margins in effect of 2.75% for the Term Loan A and 3.00% for the Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2010. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2010 was 4.68% and as of December 31, 2010 was 4.94%. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $11.1 million, $8.5 million, and $7.1 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any significant foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements that do not concern historical facts are forward looking statements and include, among other things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, operating cash flow, estimated tax rates, capital expenditures, the development of new centers and center acquisitions, government and commercial payment rates, revenue estimating risk and the impact of our related level of indebtedness on our financial performance, including earnings per share. These statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements, including, but not limited to, risks resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate, economic and market conditions, competitive activities, other business conditions, accounting estimates, the variability of our cash flows, the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates or changes to the structure of payments under the Medicare ESRD program or other government based programs, including, for example, the implementation of a bundled payment rate system beginning January 2011, which will lower reimbursement for services we provide to Medicare patients, and the impact of health care reform legislation that was enacted in the United States in March 2010, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations, the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies, continued increased competition from large and medium sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us, our ability to complete any acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, or integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire and the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of kidney dialysis services in the United States through a network of approximately 1,612 outpatient dialysis centers and approximately 750 hospitals, serving approximately 125,000 patients in 42 states. This represents an approximate 30% market share based upon the number of patients that we serve. In 2010, our overall network of dialysis centers increased by 82 centers primarily as a result of opening new centers and acquisitions and the overall number of patients that we serve increased by approximately 6.0%. Our national scale and size, among other things, allows us to provide industry leading quality care that attracts patients and referring physicians, as well as qualified medical directors, provides our patient base with convenient locations and access to a full range of services and provides us the ability to effectively control certain costs. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three stakeholders our patients, our business partners, and our teammates represents the major driver of our long term performance, although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in 40 our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes as measured by DQI have improved over each of the past three years. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States and generally exceed the dialysis outcome quality indicators of the National Kidney Foundation. In addition, over the past several years our teammate turnover has remained relatively constant, which we believe was a major contributor to our continued clinical performance improvements and also a major driver in our ability to improve productivity in 2010. We will continue to focus on these stakeholders and our clinical outcomes as we believe these are fundamental long term value drivers. Our overall financial performance was solid for 2010 and was characterized by the following as compared to 2009: consolidated revenue growth of approximately 6.0%; an increase of approximately 6.0% in the overall number of treatments that we provided; consolidated operating income growth of approximately 6.0%; and strong operating cash flows of $840 million. However, we believe that 2011 will be more challenging as we implement Medicares new payment system that began in January 2011, in which all ESRD payments will be made under a single bundled payment rate that provides for an annual inflation adjustment based upon a market basket index, less a productivity improvement factor. The new bundled payment rate provides a fixed rate to encompass all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment, including pharmaceuticals that were historically separately reimbursed irrespective of the level of pharmaceuticals administered or additional services performed. Approximately 94% of our 2010 consolidated net operating revenues were derived directly from our dialysis and related lab services business. Approximately 83% of our 2010 dialysis and related lab services revenues were derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in the 1,580 centers that we consolidate. Other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, hospital inpatient hemodialysis services and management and administrative services. These services collectively accounted for the balance of our 2010 dialysis and related lab services revenues. Our other business operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing kidney dialysis services to our network of patients. These consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs and physician services. These services generated approximately $374 million of net operating revenues in 2010, representing an 18% increase as compared to 2009. The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues in 2010 accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated net operating revenues. Operating losses from our ancillary services and strategic initiatives decreased from $12 million in 2009 to $6 million in 2010, primarily as a result of improved profitability in our pharmacy and disease management businesses. We currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives as we work to develop successful new business operations. However, any significant change in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes could result in a write off or an impairment of some or all of our investments, including goodwill, in these strategic initiatives, or could also result in significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are: the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week, as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services; average dialysis revenue per treatment; and the number of laboratory patient tests. 41 The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, which we believe is influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care, and our ability to open and acquire new centers. In 2010, we were able to increase our overall network of patients that we serviced by approximately 6% as compared to 2009. Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in 2010 and prior was primarily driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, commercial and government payment rates, and our billing and collecting operations performance. Beginning in 2011, with the implementation of Medicares new single bundled payment rate system, the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals will have a lesser impact on our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment since payment for these pharmaceuticals will be included in the bundled payment. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are significantly higher than Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis revenue per treatment. The percentage of commercial patients covered under contracted plans as compared to commercial patients with out of network providers can also significantly affect our average dialysis revenue per treatment. In 2010, the growth of our government based patients continued to outpace the growth of our commercial patients, which has been a trend that we have experienced for the past two years. We believe the growth in our government based patients is driven primarily by improved mortality and the current economic recession. This trend has negatively impacted our average dialysis revenue per treatment as a result of receiving a larger proportion of our revenue from lower payment rates associated with these additional government based patients. The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010: Revenues Medicare and Medicare assigned plans 57 % Medicaid and Medicaid assigned plans 6 % Other government based programs 3 % Total government based programs 66 % Commercial (including hospital dialysis services) 34 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Government payment rates are principally determined by federal Medicare and state Medicaid policy. These payment rates have historically had limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reduction as federal and state governments face increasing budget pressures. Medicare payment rates for dialysis services through 2008 have not been routinely increased to compensate for the impact of inflation. In July 2008, MIPPA was passed by Congress that provided dialysis providers with an increase in the composite rate of 1.0% that went into effect on January 1, 2009 and an additional 1.0% that went into effect on January 1, 2010. This legislation also changed the way Medicare will pay for dialysis services in 2011. The new payment system also provides for an annual inflation adjustment based upon a market basket index, less a productivity adjustment, beginning in 2012. Also beginning in 2012, the rule provides for up to a 2% annual payment withhold that can be earned back by facilities that meet certain defined clinical performance standards. The new payment system reimburses providers based on a single bundled or average payment for each Medicare treatment provided. This new bundled payment amount is designed to cover all dialysis services which were historically included in the composite rate and all separately billable ESRD services such as pharmaceuticals and laboratory costs. The new bundled payment rate is adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a geographic wage index and certain other factors. This initial 2011 bundled payment rate includes reductions of 2% and 3.1%, respectively, to conform to the provisions of MIPPA and to establish neutrality. Further, there is a 5.94% reduction tied to an expanded list of 42 case mix adjustors which can be earned back based upon the presence of these certain patient characteristics and co modalities at the time of treatment. There are also other provisions which may impact payment including an outlier pool and a low volume facility adjustment. We are now at risk for variations in pharmaceutical utilization since reimbursement is set at a fixed average reimbursement rate. Dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with large payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Our commercial payment rates also include payments for out of network patients that on average are higher than our in network contract rates. In 2010, we were successful in increasing some of our commercial payment rates which contributed to an increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment and helped offset some of the overall decline in our average dialysis revenue per treatment. In 2010, we also entered into several new commercial contracts with certain commercial payors that will primarily pay us a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided to patients covered by the commercial insurance plans. These contracts contain annual escalators and effectively eliminate all payments for out of network patients. We are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors and payors are aggressive in their negotiations. If our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, this would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, if there are sustained or increased job losses in the United States as a result of current economic conditions, or depending upon changes to the healthcare regulatory system, we could experience a decrease in the number of patients under commercial plans. Approximately 26% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were from physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, with EPO accounting for approximately 18% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. Therefore, in 2010 and prior, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in commercial and governmental payment rates for EPO significantly influenced our revenue. For example, in 2010, the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceutical decreased significantly from 2009, which negatively impacted our average dialysis revenue per treatment. Beginning in January 2011, the majority of our pharmaceuticals will no longer be separately billable as a result of the new Medicare single bundled payment rate system and as a result of some of our new commercial contracts that also implemented single bundled payment rates. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past several years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems. In 2010, we continued to upgrade our systems and implemented process changes and will continue to do so in 2011 to effectively capture the necessary patient characteristics and certain other factors under Medicares new bundled payment system. We believe this will help minimize reductions in our reimbursement amounts from Medicare and enhance our overall billing and collection performance associated with our payors. However, as we implement these system upgrades, our collection performance as well as our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment could be negatively impacted. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectability of our billings as of the reporting date based upon our actual historical collection experience. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was approximately $337, $340 and $334 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2010, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment decreased by approximately $3 per treatment primarily due to a decline in intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, a decline in the commercial payor mix, partially offset by an increase of 1.0% in the Medicare composite rate and an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. In 2009, the average dialysis 43 and related lab services revenue per treatment increased by approximately $6 per treatment primarily due to a 1.0% increase in the Medicare composite rate, an increase in some our commercial payment rates, an increase in our reimbursement rates for EPO and other pharmaceuticals and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by a decline in the commercial payor mix. Commercial payment rates, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals billed separately, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals under the new Medicare bundled payment rate system including our ability to capture all patient characteristics, and changes in the mix of government and commercial patients may materially impact our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in the future. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals, business infrastructure, including the operating costs of our dialysis centers, and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost variability, such as employee benefit costs and insurance costs. Our average clinical hours per treatment decreased in the last two years, primarily because of continued productivity improvements driven by reduced clinical teammate turnover and improved training and processes. We continue to strive for improved productivity levels, however we may not be able to sustain our 2010 performance as changes in federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. In addition, improvements in the U.S. economy could stimulate additional competition for skilled clinical personnel and result in higher teammate turnover which would adversely affect productivity levels. In 2010 and 2009, we experienced an increase in our clinical labor rates of approximately 2.0% and 2.5%, respectively, as clinical labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. However, in 2010, we were able to initiate certain cost control initiatives to minimize increases in our clinical labor rates. In 2010, we experienced an increase in our EPO costs, which increased by approximately 2%. In addition, our agreement with Amgen for the purchase of EPO provides for specific discount pricing and rebates based on a variety of factors including process improvements targets, patient outcome targets and data submission, which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to continue to qualify for discount pricing and rebates. In 2010, we also experienced increases in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new centers opened, and general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. General and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of consolidated revenues over the past three years. In 2010, through various cost control initiatives, we were able to control our general and administrative expenses which increased by 0.3% of net operating revenues as compared to 2009. However, this still reflects an increase in the dollar amount of spending related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal matters and supporting the growth in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. We expect that these levels of expenditures on general and administrative expenses in 2011 will increase as we continue to make investments in our long term initiatives, including further investments in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, our investments in international growth opportunities, our investments in improving our information technology and human resources infrastructure and the level of support for our regulatory compliance and legal matters. Outlook for 2011. Because of the uncertainties of operating under the new Medicare bundled payment system and the ongoing uncertainties associated with our payor mix, we will not be providing a specific guidance range for 2011 operating income at this time. However, excluding the impact of our recently announced acquisition of DSI Renal, Inc. that is not expected to close until the second or third quarter of this year, our current projections indicate that 2011 operating income will be flat or modestly down compared to 2010. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks and uncertainties, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment 44 rates or changes to the structure of payments under the Medicare ESRD program or other government based programs, including, for example, the implementation of a bundled payment rate system beginning in January 2011, which will lower reimbursement for services we provide to Medicare patients, and the impact of health care reform legislation that was enacted in the United States in March 2010, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations, the resolution of ongoing investigations by various federal and state government agencies, continued increased competition from large and medium sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us, our ability to complete any acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, or integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the cautionary language contained in the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 40 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. Results of operations We operate principally as a dialysis and related lab services business but also operate other ancillary services and strategic initiatives. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs and physician services. The dialysis and related lab services business qualifies as a separately reportable segment and all of the other ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been combined and disclosed in the other segments category. Following is a summary of consolidated operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. Year ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 6,447 100 % $ 6,109 100 % $ 5,660 100 % Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 4,475 69 % 4,249 70 % 3,920 69 % General and administrative 579 9 % 532 9 % 508 9 % Depreciation and amortization 234 4 % 229 4 % 217 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 171 3 % 162 3 % 146 3 % Equity investment income (9 ) (2 ) (1 ) Total operating expenses and charges 5,450 84 % 5,169 85 % 4,791 85 % Operating income $ 997 16 % $ 940 15 % $ 869 15 % The following table summarizes consolidated net operating revenues: Year ended 2010 2009 2008 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 6,073 $ 5,792 $ 5,415 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives 374 317 245 Consolidated net operating revenues $ 6,447 $ 6,109 $ 5,660 45 The following table summarizes consolidated operating income: Year ended 2010 2009(1) 2008(1) (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 1,039 $ 994 $ 939 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives loss (6 ) (12 ) (30 ) Total segment operating income 1,034 982 910 Reconciling items: Stock based compensation (46 ) (44 ) (41 ) Equity investment income 9 2 1 Consolidated operating income 997 940 869 (1) Certain costs previously reported in ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been reclassified to dialysis and related lab services to conform to the current year presentation. Consolidated net operating revenues Consolidated net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $338 million or approximately 5.5% from 2009. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $281 million, principally due to an increase in the number of treatments, partially offset by a decline of $3 in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, and an increase of approximately $57 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services and from our infusion therapy services. Consolidated net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $449 million or approximately 7.9% from 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $377 million, principally due to an increase in the number of treatments, and an increase of approximately $72 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services, disease management services and from our infusion therapy services. Consolidated operating income Consolidated operating income of $997 million for 2010 increased by approximately $57 million, or 6.1%, from 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue as a result of additional treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions in dialysis and related lab services, partially offset by a decline in our average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3, as described below. Operating income also increased as a result of continued cost control initiatives, improved productivity, overall lower pharmaceutical costs and lower operating losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, partially offset by the negative impact of a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, higher labor costs and increases in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Consolidated operating income of $940 million for 2009 increased by approximately $71 million, or 8.2%, from 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue as a result of non acquired treatment growth in dialysis and related lab services, as well as an increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6 as described below. Operating income also increased as a result of cost control initiatives, improved productivity and lower operating losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, which losses were reduced by approximately $18 million in 2009, partially offset by the negative impact of higher pharmaceutical, labor and benefit costs, and increases in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. 46 Operating segments Dialysis and Related Lab Services Year ended 2010 2009 2008 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, exceptper treatment data) Revenues $ 6,073 $ 5,792 $ 5,415 Segment operating income $ 1,039 $ 994 $ 939 Dialysis treatments 17,992,805 17,010,450 16,217,107 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 57,485 54,433 51,663 Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment $ 337 $ 340 $ 334 Net operating revenues Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $281 million or approximately 4.9% from 2009. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 5.6%, partially offset by a decline in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3, or 0.9%. The increase in the number of treatments was primarily due to an increase in non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. The decline in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2010, as compared to 2009, was primarily due to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals and a decline in the commercial payor mix, partially offset by a 1% increase in the Medicare composite rate and an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $377 million or approximately 7.0% from 2008. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 4.7%, and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6, or 1.9%. The increase in the number of treatments was primarily due to an increase in non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. The increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2009, as compared to 2008, was primarily due to a 1% increase in the Medicare composite rate, an increase in some of our commercial payment rates, an increase in our reimbursement rates for EPO and other pharmaceuticals, and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by a decline in the commercial payor mix. The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues by modality for the year ended December 31, 2010: Revenuepercentages Outpatient hemodialysis centers 83 % Peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis 12 % Hospital inpatient hemodialysis 5 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Approximately 66% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare assigned plans, representing approximately 89% of our total patients. Over the last two years, we have been experiencing growth in our government based patients that has been outpacing the growth in our commercial patients which has negatively impacted our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment. In 2010, approximately 11% of 47 our patients and 34% of our revenues were associated with commercial payors, as compared to 12% and 35%, respectively, for 2009. Less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are due directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 5% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. On average we are paid significantly more for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans than we are for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other government plans such as Medicare assigned plans. Patients covered by commercial health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Nearly all of our net earnings from dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at negotiated payment rates as established by contract and others of which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule for our out of network patients. If we experience a net overall reduction in our contracted and non contracted commercial rates as a result of these negotiations or restrictions, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors, including our commercial payment rates, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are billed separately, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals under the new Medicare bundled payment rate system, including our ability to capture all patient characteristics, and changes in the mix of government and commercial patients. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and operating costs of the dialysis centers. The dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $232, $235 and $230 for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The $3 decrease in the per treatment costs in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, a decrease in our overall pharmaceutical costs and continued improvements in productivity, partially offset by higher labor rates. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis increased by approximately $5 in 2009 as compared to 2008. The increase in the per treatment costs was primarily attributable to higher labor rates and benefit costs, an increase in pharmaceutical costs, an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers and an increase in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by improved productivity. General and administrative expenses. Dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses for the years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $471 million, $428 million and $402 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $43 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to increases in labor costs, an increase in our professional expenses for legal and compliance matters and the timing of certain other expenditures. The increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $26 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to increases in labor and benefit costs, partially offset by the timing of certain other expenditures. Depreciation and amortization. Dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $228 million, $222 million and $210 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $6 million in depreciation and amortization for dialysis and related lab services in 2010 and $12 million in 2009 were primarily due to growth through new center developments and expansions. 48 Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for dialysis and related lab services was 2.8% for 2010, 2.7% for 2009, and 2.6% for 2008. The increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts in 2010 was primarily to reflect a slowdown in the collection of payments from some of our non government payors. The current provision level of 2.8% may increase if we encounter problems with our billing and collection process as a result of sustained weakness in the U.S. economy. Operating income Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2010 increased by approximately $45 million as compared to 2009. The increase in the operating income for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to growth in the number of dialysis treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3 as described above. The dialysis and related lab services operating income also increased as a result of certain cost control initiatives, improved productivity, and overall lower pharmaceutical costs. However, the dialysis and related lab services operating income was negatively impacted primarily by a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, higher labor costs and an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2009 increased by approximately $55 million as compared to 2008. The increase in the operating income for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to growth in the number of dialysis treatments and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6 as described above. The dialysis and related lab services operating income also increased as a result of certain cost control initiatives and improved productivity, but was negatively impacted primarily by higher labor and benefit costs, an increase in pharmaceutical costs and an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Other Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Year ended 2010 2009 2008 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Revenues $ 374 $ 317 $ 245 Segment operating loss $ (6 ) $ (12 ) $ (30 ) Net operating revenues The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $57 million or 18.0% as compared to 2009, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, and from our infusion therapy services, partially offset by a decline in our net operating revenues in our disease management services as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2009 increased by approximately $72 million or 29.5% as compared to 2008, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, disease management services and from our infusion therapy services. Operating expenses Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2010 increased by approximately $51 million from 2009, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business and an increase in labor costs, partially offset by lower operating costs of our disease management services as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2009 increased by approximately $54 million from 2008, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business and an increase in labor and benefit costs, partially offset by lower professional fees. 49 Operating loss Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2010 decreased by approximately $6 million from 2009. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to volume growth in revenues associated with our pharmacy business, and a decrease in operating losses in our disease management business as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2009 decreased by approximately $18 million from 2008. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to volume growth in revenues outpacing increases in operating expenses, primarily associated with our pharmacy business and our disease management business, partially offset by an increase in operating losses associated with certain new initiatives. Corporate level charges Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation of approximately $46 million for 2010 increased by approximately $2 million from 2009. Stock based compensation of approximately $44 million for 2009 increased by approximately $3 million from 2008. The increase in 2010 resulted principally from an increase in the overall grant date fair value for the grant years that contributed expense to 2010, driven in part by a substantial increase in the grant date fair value of 2010 grants over that for recent years offset by a significant reduction in the number of awards granted in 2010. The increase in 2009 resulted from increases in both the aggregate quantity of grants and in the overall grant date fair value for the grant years that contributed expense to 2009. Debt expense. Debt expense for 2010, 2009, and 2008 consisted of interest expense of approximately $172 million, $176 million, and $215 million, respectively, including the amortization and accretion of debt discounts and premiums and the amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $9 million in 2010 and $10 million for 2009 and 2008. The decrease in interest expense in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily related to lower average outstanding principal balances on our previously outstanding Term Loan A, lower average outstanding principal balances on our previously outstanding senior notes, lower interest rates associated with the issuance of our New Senior Notes and a decrease in our weighted average effective interest rate on the Term Loan B as a result of lower notional amounts of fixed rate swap agreements that contained higher rates. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2010 was 4.68% as compared to 4.86% in 2009. However, interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2010 was negatively affected by the refinancing of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities that occurred on October 20, 2010, as the interest rates under our new Senior Secured Credit Facilities are substantially higher than the interest rates under the previous facility. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in the fourth quarter of 2010 was 4.86%. Therefore, we expect our overall interest expense in 2011 will be significantly higher than 2010. The decrease in interest expense in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to decreases in the LIBOR based variable interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt and the result of lower notional amounts of fixed rate swap agreements that contained higher rates. As of December 31, 2009, the notional amounts of our fixed rate swaps were approximately $389 million as compared to approximately $790 million at December 31, 2008. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2009 was 4.86% as compared to 5.82% in 2008. Equity investment income. Equity investment income was approximately $9.0 million in 2010 as compared to $2.4 million in 2009. The increase in equity investment income in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the profitability of our nonconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in equity investment income in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to an increase in the number of equity investments and improved profitability at several joint ventures. Other income. Other income was approximately $3 million, $4 million, and $12 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, and consisted principally of interest income. The decreases in other income in 2010 and 2009 were primarily the result of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash balances. 50 Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for 2010 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 35.0%, compared with 36.7% and 35.9% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2010 was lower primarily due to the impact of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and nonrecurring tax benefits associated with closed examinations and statutes. We currently project the effective income tax rate for 2011 to be in the range of 35.0% to 36.0%. Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, and our investments in ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that an impairment review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. These types of adjustments are charged directly to the corresponding operating segment that incurred the charge. No significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented. Noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $79 million, $57 million and $47 million, respectively. The increases in noncontrolling interests in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to increases in the number of new joint ventures and increases in the profitability of our dialysis related joint ventures. The percentage of dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues generated from dialysis related joint ventures was approximately 18% in 2010 compared to 16% in 2009. Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2010 and 2009 represented approximately 61 and 68 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt allowance. The relative decrease in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2010 was a result of improved cash collections. However, our cash collections during the first half of 2011 could be negatively impacted as a result of implementing Medicares new single bundled payment rate system. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately $153 million and $201 million in unreserved accounts receivable, respectively, representing approximately 15% and 18% of our total accounts receivable balance, respectively, were more than six months old. During 2010, we experienced improved cash collections from certain government payors and certain commercial payors. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than 1% of our revenues are classified as patient pay. Substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $46 million for both years, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Currently, a significant portion of our Medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. However, the payment received from Medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. Such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements, except for potentially limiting the collectability of these Medicare bad debt claims. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2010, our cash balance was $860 million and we had undrawn credit under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $250 million, of which approximately $46 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows 51 and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2010 amounted to $840 million, compared with $667 million for 2009. The increase in our operating cash flows in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to improved cash earnings and an improvement in our accounts receivable collections as described above. Cash flow from operations in 2010 included cash interest payments of approximately $191 million and cash tax payments of $207 million. Cash flow from operations in 2009 included cash interest payments of $186 million and cash tax payments of $162 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2010 included $279 million for capital asset expenditures, including $120 million for new center developments and relocations, and $159 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $189 million for acquisitions. During 2010, we also received $61 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, we received $60 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $84 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $10 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 8.9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $619 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2009 included $275 million for capital asset expenditures, including $161 million for new center developments and relocations, and $114 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $88 million for acquisitions. During 2009, we also received $33 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, we received $75 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $68 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $13 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 2.9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $154 million. During 2010, we acquired a total of 41 dialysis centers, opened 65 new dialysis centers, sold six centers, closed 18 centers and made minority equity investments in three centers that were previously under management and administrative service agreements. During 2009, we acquired a total of 19 dialysis centers, opened 78 new dialysis centers, sold six centers, closed 18 centers, made minority equity investments in six centers and added two centers under management and administrative service agreements. Acquisition On February 4, 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding equity securities of CDSI I Holding Company, Inc., parent company of dialysis provider DSI Renal, Inc. (DSI), in cash for approximately $689.2 million, subject to among other things, adjustments for certain items such as working capital, the purchase of noncontrolling interests, capital assets and acquisitions expenditures. DSI currently operates approximately 106 outpatient dialysis centers serving approximately 8,000 patients. The transaction is subject to approval by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) including Hart Scott Rodino antitrust clearance. We anticipate that we will be required by the FTC to divest a certain number of outpatient dialysis centers as a condition of the transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of fiscal 2011. 2010 capital structure changes and other items On October 20, 2010, we entered into a $3,000 million new Senior Secured Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), consisting of a five year $250 million revolving line of credit, a five year $1,000 million Term Loan A and a six year $1,750 million Term Loan B. We also have the right to request an increase to the borrowing 52 capacity to a total aggregate principal amount of not more than $4,000 million subject to bank participation. The revolving line of credit and the Term Loan A will initially bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest rate margin of 2.75% until June 30, 2011, and then is subject to adjustment depending upon our leverage ratio and can range from 2.25% to 2.75%. The Term Loan A requires annual principal payments of $50 million in 2011, $50 million in 2012, $100 million in 2013, and $150 million in 2014, with the balance of $650 million due in 2015. The Term Loan B bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.50%) plus 3.00% subject to a ratings based step down to 2.75%. The Term Loan B requires annual principal payments of $17.5 million in each year from 2011 through 2015 with the balance of $1,663 million due in 2016. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of DaVitas and its guarantors assets. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants such as various restrictions on investments, acquisitions, the payment of dividends, redemptions and acquisitions of capital stock, capital expenditures and other indebtedness, as well as limitations on the amount of tangible net assets in non guarantor subsidiaries. However, many of these restrictions will not apply as long as our leverage ratio is below 3.50:1.00. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires compliance with financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio and a leverage ratio that determines the interest rate margins as described above. On October 20, 2010, we also issued $775 million aggregate principal amount of 6 3/8% senior notes due 2018 and $775 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2020 (the New Senior Notes). The New Senior Notes will pay interest on May 1 and November 1, of each year beginning May 1, 2011. The New Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally to other unsecured senior indebtedness. The New Senior Notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. We may redeem some or all of the 6 3/8% senior notes at any time on or after November 1, 2013 at certain redemption prices and may redeem some or all of the 6 5/8% senior notes at any time on or after November 1, 2014 at certain redemption prices. We received total proceeds of $4,300 million from these transactions, $2,750 million from the borrowings on Term Loan A and Term Loan B and an additional $1,550 million from the issuance of the New Senior Notes. We used a portion of the proceeds to pay off the outstanding principal balances of our existing senior secured credit facilities plus accrued interest totaling $1,795 million and to purchase pursuant to a cash tender offer $558 million of the outstanding principal balances of our $700 million 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $731 million of the outstanding balances of our $850 million 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015 (the Existing Notes), plus accrued interest totaling $1,297 million. The total amount paid for the Existing Notes was $1,019.06 per $1,000 principal amount of the 6 5/8% senior notes and $1,038.75 per $1,000 principal amount of the 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes. This resulted in us paying a cash tender premium of $39 million in order to extinguish this portion of the Existing Notes. On November 19, 2010, we redeemed the remaining outstanding balance of the existing 6 5/8% senior notes of $142 million at 101.656% per $1,000 and the remaining outstanding balance of the existing 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes of $119 million at 103.625% per $1,000 plus accrued interest totaling $265 million. In addition, we paid a call premium totaling $7 million. We also paid an additional $74 million in fees, discounts and other expenses. As a result of the above transactions, we received approximately $823 million in excess cash which we intend to use for general purposes and other opportunities, including share repurchases, potential acquisitions and other growth investments. In connection with these transactions, we expensed debt refinancing and redemption charges totaling $70.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, which includes the write off of certain existing deferred financing costs and other new financing costs, the cash tender and call premiums, as described above and other expenses. On June 7, 2010, we redeemed $200 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013, at a price of 101.656% plus accrued interest. As a result of this transaction, we expensed debt redemption charges of $4.1 million, which includes the call premium and the net write off of other finance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010 we made mandatory principal payments totaling $65.6 million on the prior Term Loan A. 53 Interest rate swaps In January 2011, we entered into nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1.0 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan A debt to fixed rates ranging from 1.59% to 1.64%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 4.36% including the Term Loan A margin of 2.75%. The swap agreements expire on September 30, 2014 and require monthly interest payments. In addition, in January 2011, we also entered into five interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling $1.25 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 4.00% on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan B debt. The cap agreements expire on September 30, 2014. Our previous interest rate swap agreements expired on September 30, 2010. The agreements that were effective during 2010 had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 4.05% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.84% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the Term Loan B margin of 1.50%. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we accrued net cash obligations of approximately $9.1 million, $17.3 million and $4.2 million, respectively, from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2010, the interest rates were fixed on approximately 77% of our total debt. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 4.05%, based upon the current margins in effect of 2.75% for the Term Loan A and 3.00% for the Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2010. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2010 was 4.68% and as of December 31, 2010 was 4.94%. Stock repurchases During 2010, we repurchased a total of 8,918,760 shares of our common stock for $618.5 million, or an average price of $69.35 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. On November 3, 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an increase of an additional $800 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions, the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2010 was $682 million. We have not repurchased any additional shares of our common stock from January 1, 2011 through February 25, 2011. This stock repurchase program has no expiration date. Other items On July 22, 2010, we entered into a First Amended and Restated National Service Provider Agreement, or the Agreement, with NxStage Medical Inc., or NxStage. The Agreement supersedes the National Service Provider Agreement that we entered into with NxStage on February 7, 2007. Under terms of the Agreement, we will have the ability to continue to purchase NxStage System One hemodialysis machines and related supplies at discounted prices. In addition, under the Agreement, we may earn warrants to purchase NxStage common stock subject to certain requirements, including our ability to achieve certain System One home patient growth targets. The Agreement provides for a range of warrant amounts that may be earned annually depending upon the achievement of various home patient targets. The maximum amount of shares underlying warrants that we can earn over three years is 5.5 million. The exercise price of the warrants is $14.22 per share. In connection 54 therewith, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement whereby NxStage has agreed to register any shares issued to us under the warrants. The Agreement expires on June 30, 2013, and will be automatically extended on a monthly basis unless terminated by either party pursuant to the Agreement. In July 2010, we announced that we will construct a new corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado. In July 2010, we acquired the land and existing improvements for approximately $12 million. Effective December 18, 2010, we entered into a construction agreement for the construction of the new building. We currently estimate the total construction costs and other project costs of the building will be approximately $95 million. Construction is expected to begin in early 2011, and is estimated to be complete in the second half of 2012. In 2010, we paid architecture and other design costs totaling approximately $5 million. Stock based compensation Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the straight line amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in all prior periods. During 2010, we granted 2,037,294 stock settled stock appreciation rights with a grant date fair value of $32.3 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 3.5 years, and also granted 467,962 stock units with a grant date fair value of $29.4 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 2.5 years. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recognized $45.6 million and $44.4 million, respectively, in stock based compensation expense for stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock options, stock units and discounted employee stock plan purchases, which is primarily included in general and administrative expenses. The estimated tax benefits recorded for this stock based compensation in 2010 and 2009 were $17.3 million and $16.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, there was $83.1 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we received $48.7 million and $63.7 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $26.7 million and $18.2 million, respectively, in total actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. 2009 capital structure changes Term Loan A During 2009, we made mandatory principal payments totaling $61.3 million on our previous Term Loan A. As a result of these principal payments, the outstanding balance on Term Loan A as of December 31, 2009 was $153.1 million and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50%, for an overall weighted average effective rate of 1.74%. The interest rate margin was subject to adjustment depending upon certain financial conditions and could range from 1.50% to 2.25%. Term Loan B As of December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance of our Term Loan B was $1.7 billion and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% for an overall weighted average effective rate of 2.66%, including the impact of our swap agreements that were in effect. We did not make any principal payments on Term Loan B during 2009, nor were we required to. 55 Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes Our senior and senior subordinated notes, as of December 31, 2009, consisted of $900 million of 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $850 million of 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. The notes were guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and require semi annual interest payments in March and September. We could redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after March 15, 2009 and some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time on or after March 15, 2010. All of the outstanding balances under the Term Loan A, Term Loan B and the senior and senior subordinated notes were extinguished as part of our debt refinancing transactions that occurred on October 20, 2010, as described above. Stock repurchases During 2009, we repurchased a total of 2,902,619 shares of our common stock for $153.5 million, or an average price of $52.88 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. On November 3, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an increase of an additional $500 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2009 was $500 million. This stock repurchase program had no expiration date. Interest rate swaps As of December 31, 2009, we maintained a total of eight interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $389 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 3.88% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.78% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the Term Loan B margin of 1.50%. The swap agreements expired on September 30, 2010. During 2009, we accrued net cash obligations of approximately $17.3 million from these swaps, which were included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2009, the interest rates were economically fixed on approximately 21% of our variable rate debt and approximately 59% of our total debt. As a result of the swap agreements our overall weighted average effective interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 2.63%, based upon the current margins in effect of 1.50%, as of December 31, 2009. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2009 was 4.86% and as of December 31, 2009 was 4.68%. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases and letters of credit as well as potential obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated businesses and to dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several joint ventures and for some of our non wholly owned subsidiaries in the form of put provisions. If these put provisions were exercised, we would be required to purchase the third party owners noncontrolling interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the noncontrolling interests put to us, which is intended to approximate fair value. For additional information see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements. 56 We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several other dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties or centers in which we own an equity investment, as well as to physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under management and administrative services agreements. The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010 (in millions): Less Than1 year 2 3years 4 5years After5 years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 74 $ 186 $ 835 $ 3,214 $ 4,309 Interest payments 104 202 202 379 887 Interest payments on the Term Loan B(1) 96 157 153 61 467 Capital lease obligations 1 2 1 4 8 Operating leases 232 403 326 555 1,516 Construction of the new corporate headquarters 60 30 90 $ 567 $ 980 $ 1,517 $ 4,213 $ 7,277 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 46 $ $ $ $ 46 Noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions 225 67 48 43 383 Operating capital advances 2 2 $ 273 $ 67 $ 48 $ 43 $ 431 (1) Assuming no changes to LIBOR based interest rates as the Term Loan B currently bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.50%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.00%. Not included above are interest payments related to our Term Loan A. The Term Loan A currently bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.75%, for an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 3.02% as of December 31, 2010. The interest rate margin is subject to an adjustment depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios and can range from 2.25% to 2.75%. Interest payments are due at the maturity of specific debt tranches within each Term Loan, currently monthly, which can range in maturity from one month to twelve months. Future interest payments will depend upon the amount of mandatory principal payments and principal prepayments, as well as changes in the LIBOR based interest rates and changes in the interest rate margins. Assuming no principal prepayments on our Term Loan A during 2011 and no changes in the effective interest rate, including the interest rate margin, approximately $30 million of interest would be required to be paid in 2011 related to the Term Loan A. In addition to the above commitments, we are obligated to purchase a certain amount of our hemodialysis products and supplies at fixed prices through 2015 from Gambro Renal Products, Inc. in connection with the Product Supply Agreement. Our total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs in each year. In January 2010, we entered into an agreement with Fresenius which committed us to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies from them through 2013. Our total expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2010 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs. The actual amount of purchases in future years from Gambro Renal Products and Fresenius will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, and in the case of the Product Supply Agreement, Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. 57 Settlements of approximately $11 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made. Contingencies The information in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements of this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and contingencies. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly variable compensation accruals, purchase accounting valuation estimates, fair value estimates and stock based compensation are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Beginning in January 2011, we are also subject to certain variations in our reimbursements from Medicare as we implement Medicares new single bundled payment rate system whereby our reimbursements can be adjusted for certain patient characteristics and certain other factors. Our revenue recognition will depend upon our ability to effectively capture, document and bill for Medicares base payment rate and these other factors. In addition, as a result of the potential range of variations that can occur in our reimbursements from Medicare under the new single bundled payment rate system, our revenue recognition will be subject to a greater degree of estimating risk. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for 58 payments, slow down in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 125,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as 6% of consolidated operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairments of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers or other operations. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year, and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. We are required to assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and to also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain and future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. Purchase accounting valuation estimates. We make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets, liabilities and contractual as well as non contractual contingencies 59 associated with our acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Fair value estimates. We have recorded certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions at fair value. The FASB defines fair value which is measured based upon certain valuation techniques that include inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. We have measured the fair values of our applicable assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions based upon certain market inputs and assumptions that are either observable or unobservable in determining fair values and have also classified these assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels. The fair value of our investments available for sale are based upon quoted market prices from active markets and the fair value of our swap agreements were based upon valuation models and a variety of techniques as reported by various broker dealers that were based upon relevant observable market inputs such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, and other credit and liquidity market conditions. For our noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions we have estimated the fair values of these based upon either the higher of a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. During the second quarter of 2010, we refined the methodology used to estimate the fair value of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions by eliminating an annual inflation factor that was previously applied to the put provisions until they became exercisable. We believe that eliminating an annual inflation factor will result in a better representation of the estimated actual fair value of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. The estimate of the fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners noncontrolling interests. Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the straight line amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk free interest rates. Significant new accounting standards In August 2010, the FASB issued transition guidance for healthcare entities for measuring charity care that was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. Charity care is defined as healthcare services that are provided but are not expected to result in cash flows where the patients have demonstrated the inability to pay. The guidance requires management to disclose their policy on providing charity care, the level of charity care provided, the measurement of the direct and indirect costs of providing those services, and the amount of any subsidies received for providing charity care. Management can also estimate the costs of those services using reasonable techniques. The guidance shall be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Effective January 1, 2010, the FASB eliminated the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and required additional disclosures about an enterprises involvement in variable interest entities. An entity is required to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity by having both the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact 60 the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity, or the right to receive benefits from the entity. In addition, the FASB established new guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity, requiring an ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and adding an additional reconsideration event for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity when any changes in facts and circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk, as a group, lose the power from voting rights or similar rights of those investments to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of adopting these new requirements. Effective December 15, 2009, FASB amended certain fair value disclosure requirements to include additional disclosures related to significant transfers in and out of the various fair value hierarchy levels and to clarify existing disclosures by providing disaggregate levels for each class of assets and liabilities. We are also required to provide additional disclosures on the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value, as well as changes to the valuation techniques and inputs, for both recurring and nonrecurring assets and liabilities carried at fair value. In addition, we are also required to disclose the reason for making changes to our valuation techniques, assumptions and or other unobservable market inputs. Certain other disclosures on reporting the gross activity rather than the net activity for Level 3 fair value measurements is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2010. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2010. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average LIBOR rates in effect for all debt tranches plus interest rate margins in effect at the end of 2010. The Term Loan A margin currently in effect is 2.75% and along with the revolving line of credit is subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio. The Term Loan B currently bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.50%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.00% subject to a ratings based step down to 2.75%. Expected maturity date Total FairValue Averageinterestrate 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 19 $ 19 $ 19 $ 18 $ 18 $ 3,218 $ 3,311 $ 3,305 5.49 % Variable rate $ 56 $ 50 $ 100 $ 150 $ 650 $ $ 1,006 $ 1,008 3.11 % Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which include the Term Loan A and the Term Loan B, consist of various individual tranches that can range in maturity from one month to twelve months (currently monthly). For the Term Loan A each specific tranche would bear interest at a LIBOR rate that is determined by the maturity of that specific tranche plus an interest rate margin. The LIBOR variable component of the interest rate is reset as each specific tranche matures and a new tranche is re established and can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions including the credit and capital markets. In January 2011, we entered into several interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of fixing all of the Term Loan A LIBOR variable component of our interest rate, as described below. Our Term Loan B is currently effectively fixed since the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate is set at a LIBOR floor of 1.50%. We have included it in the fixed rate totals in the table above until such time as the LIBOR based component of our interest rate exceeds 1.50%. We will then be subject to LIBOR based interest rate volatility on the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate, but only up to 4.00% on $1.25 billion of outstanding principal debt on the Term Loan B, as described below. The remaining $500 million of outstanding debt on the Term Loan B is subject to LIBOR based interest rate volatility above a floor of 1.50%. 61 In January 2011, we entered into nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1.0 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan A debt to fixed rates ranging from 1.59% to 1.64%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 4.36% including the Term Loan A margin of 2.75%. The swap agreements expire on September 30, 2014 and require monthly interest payments. In addition, in January 2011, we also entered into five interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling $1.25 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 4.00% on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan B debt. The cap agreements expire on September 30, 2014. Our previous interest rate swap agreements expired on September 30, 2010. The agreements that were effective during 2010 had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 4.05% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.84% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the Term Loan B margin of 1.50%. During 2010, we accrued net cash obligations of $9.1 million from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2010, the interest rates were fixed on approximately 77% of our total debt. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 4.05%, based upon the current margins in effect of 2.75% for the Term Loan A and 3.00% for the Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2010. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2010 was 4.68% and as of December 31, 2010 was 4.94%. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $11.1 million, $8.5 million, and $7.1 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
