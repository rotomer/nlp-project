The following financial and operating data should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this report. The following table presents selected consolidated financial and operating data for the periods indicated. Effective January 1, 2009, we were required to present consolidated net income attributable to us and to noncontrolling interests on the face of the consolidated statement of income, which changed the presentation of minority interests (noncontrolling interests) in our consolidated statements of income. These consolidated financial results have been recast for all prior periods presented to reflect the retrospective application of adopting these new presentation and disclosure requirements for noncontrolling interests.

We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of kidney dialysis services, primarily in the United States, through a network of approximately 1,809 outpatient dialysis centers and approximately 900 hospitals, located in the United States throughout 43 states and District of Columbia, serving a total of approximately 142,000 patients. We estimate that we have approximately a 32% market share in the United States based upon the number of patients that we serve. In 2011, our overall network of dialysis centers increased by 208 centers primarily as a result of acquisitions and from opening new centers. In September 2011 we acquired DSI, a medium sized dialysis provider, for approximately $723 million in net cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. DSI contributed a net 83 dialysis centers, after which we agreed to divest a total of 30 dialysis centers in order to complete the acquisition of DSI. In addition, the overall number of patients that we serve in the U.S. increased by approximately 13.0% as compared to 2010. In addition, as of December 31, 2011, we provided dialysis and administrative services to a total of 11 outpatient dialysis centers located in three countries outside of the United States. Our international dialysis operations are currently in a start up phase in which we primarily commenced operations during the fourth quarter of 2011. The total net operating revenues generated from our international operations were not material 43 during 2011 and are included as a component of our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. Therefore, all references in this document to dialysis and related lab services continue to refer only to our U.S. dialysis and related lab services business for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our national scale and size, among other things, allows us to provide industry leading quality care with superior clinical outcomes that attracts patients and referring physicians, as well as qualified medical directors, provides our patient base with convenient locations and access to a full range of services and provides us the ability to effectively control certain costs while maintaining strong compliance programs. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three stakeholders our patients, our business partners, and our teammates represents the major driver of our long term performance, although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes as measured by DQI have improved over each of the past three years which we believe directly decreases patient mortalities. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States and generally exceed the dialysis outcome quality indicators of the National Kidney Foundation. In addition, over the past several years our teammate turnover has remained relatively constant, which we believe was a major contributor to our continued clinical performance improvements and also a major driver of our ability to maintain or improve clinical hours per treatment. We will continue to focus on these stakeholders and our clinical outcomes as we believe these are fundamental long term value drivers. Our overall financial performance was strong for 2011 and was characterized by strong treatment volume growth, primarily from acquisitions and non acquired growth rates and by decreased operating costs from a decline in the utilization of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals due to continued evolution of clinical practices and physicians responding to the new FDA label for EPO. Our major financial operating performance indicators in 2011 as compared to 2010 were as follows: consolidated revenue growth of approximately 8.5%; an increase of approximately 9.1% in the overall number of treatments that we provided; normalized non acquired treatment growth of 4.6%; consolidated operating income growth of approximately 13.4%, which includes the impact of a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 2.4%; effective operating cost control initiatives; and strong operating cash flows of $1,180 million. However, we believe that 2012 will continue to be challenging as we implement some additional Medicare billing requirements and as we implement system and process upgrades to enhance our ability to capture certain patient characteristics that can impact our overall reimbursements from Medicare. In addition, there remains significant scrutiny and uncertainty around the utilization of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, which along with pharmaceutical cost increases and changes in certain government policies, can have a significant impact on our operating results. We are also committed to our international expansion plans that will continue to require a significant investment in 2012. In addition, if the percentage of our patients with commercial payors continues to deteriorate this would also impact our operating results. Approximately 93% of our 2011 consolidated net operating revenues were derived directly from our dialysis and related lab services business. Approximately 81% of our 2011 dialysis and related lab services revenues were derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in the 1,776 U.S. centers that we consolidate. Other dialysis 44 services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, hospital inpatient hemodialysis services and management and administrative services. These services collectively accounted for the balance of our 2011 dialysis and related lab services revenues. Our other business operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. These consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs, physician services and our international dialysis operations. These services generated approximately $514 million of net operating revenues in 2011, representing approximately 7% of our consolidated net operating revenues. We currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives including our continued expansion into certain international markets as we work to develop successful new business operations in the United States as well as outside the United States. However, any significant change in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes in these strategic initiatives could result in a write off or an impairment of some or all of our investments, including goodwill, which occurred in 2011 when we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge relating to our infusion therapy business, and could also result in significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are: the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week, as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services; and average dialysis revenue per treatment. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, which we believe is influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, our relationships with referring physicians, together with the quality of our clinical care which can lead to reduced patient mortalities, and our ability to open and acquire new dialysis centers. In 2011, we were able to increase our overall network of patients that we serviced in the U.S. by approximately 13% as compared to 2010. Our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in 2011 was primarily driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, commercial and government payment rates, our billing and collecting operations performance, and the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are separately billable. Beginning in 2011, with the implementation of Medicares new single bundled payment rate system, the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals had a lesser impact on our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment since payment for these pharmaceuticals is included in a single bundled payment. In addition, some of our commercial contracts covering certain patients also pay us under a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are significantly higher than Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis revenue per treatment. The percentage of commercial patients covered under contracted plans as compared to commercial patients with out of network providers can also significantly affect our average dialysis revenue per treatment. In 2011, the growth of our government based patients continued to outpace the growth of our commercial patients, which has been a trend that we have experienced for the past several years. We believe the growth in our government based patients is driven primarily by improved mortality and the current economic environment, which impacts the number of individuals that are covered under commercial insurance plans. This trend has negatively impacted our average dialysis revenue per treatment as a result of receiving a larger proportion of our revenue from government based payors, such as Medicare, that reimburse us at lower payment rates. 45 The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011: Revenues Medicare and Medicare assigned plans 58 % Medicaid and Medicaid assigned plans 5 % Other government based programs 3 % Total government based programs 66 % Commercial (including hospital dialysis services) 34 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Government payment rates in the United States are principally determined by federal Medicare and state Medicaid policy. These payment rates have historically had limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reduction as federal and state governments face increasing budget pressures. On January 1, 2011 we implemented Medicares new payment system in which all ESRD payments are made under a single bundled payment rate that, beginning in 2012, will provide for an annual inflation adjustment based upon a market basket index, less a productivity adjustment. Also beginning in 2012, the rule provides for up to a 2% annual payment withhold that can be earned back by the facilities that meet certain defined clinical performance standards. The new payment system reimburses providers based upon a single bundled or average payment for each Medicare treatment provided. This new bundled payment amount is designed to cover all dialysis services which were historically included in the composite rate and all separately billable ESRD services such as pharmaceuticals and laboratory costs. In the past the amount of services that were separately billable accounted for approximately 30% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues. The new bundled payment rate is adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a geographic wage index and certain other factors. The initial 2011 bundled payment rate included reductions of 2.0% from the prior reimbursement and further reduced overall rates by 5.94% tied to an expanded list of case mix adjustors which can be earned back based upon the presence of certain patient characteristics and co modalities at the time of treatment. There are also other provisions which may impact payment including an outlier pool and a low volume facility adjustment with regard to the expanded list of case mix adjusters. These are difficult and, in some cases, have not been possible for our dialysis centers to document and track, which has resulted in lower reimbursement amounts than we would otherwise have received. On April 1, 2011, CMS released an interim final rule correcting the 3.1% transition adjustment factor to properly update the number of ESRD facilities that elected to opt fully into the new Prospective Payment System (PPS). This new rule is prospective and as a result, effective April 1, 2011 we began recognizing revenues in accordance with the new rule, which resulted in an increase in Medicare revenue per treatment of approximately 3.1% in comparison to our levels recorded in the first quarter of 2011. This reduced our transition adjustment to zero for the balance of 2011 and to an aggregate of approximately 0.75% for 2011. On November 1, 2011, CMS issued the final ESRD Prospective Payment System (PPS) rule for 2012. The base rate will increase by 2.1%, representing a market basket increase of 3.0% less a productivity adjustment of 0.9%. The increase in the final base rate for 2012 (2.1%) is slightly greater than the increase of 1.8% stated in the proposed 2012 ESRD PPS rule published in July 2011, and higher than the 1.0% increase recommended by MedPAC. In 2012 and beyond, the ESRD PPS system includes additional quality measures that could result in decreased payments if a dialysis facility fails to meet the standards. Also, beginning January 1, 2014, certain oral only ESRD drugs (currently paid separately to pharmacies under Medicare Part D) will be included in the ESRD bundled payment to dialysis facilities. It is currently unclear how CMS will price the oral only drugs for inclusion in the ESRD bundle in 2014. We believe the new payment system presents additional operating clinical and financial risks that our dialysis centers or billing and other systems may not accurately document and track the appropriate patient specific characteristics, resulting in a reduction or overpayment in the amounts of the payments that we would otherwise be entitled to receive. 46 Dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Our commercial payment rates also include payments for out of network patients that on average are higher than our in network contract rates. In 2011, we were successful in increasing some of our commercial payment rates which contributed to an increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment, which helped offset some of the overall decline in our average dialysis revenue per treatment. In 2011, we also entered into some commercial contracts covering certain patients that will primarily pay us a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided to these patients. We are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors, and payors are aggressive in their negotiations. If our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, this would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, if there are sustained or increased job losses in the United States as a result of current economic conditions, or depending upon changes to the healthcare regulatory system, we could experience a decrease in the number of patients under commercial plans. Approximately 4% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, were from physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are separately billable, with EPO accounting for approximately 3% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. The impact of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals on our overall revenues that are separately billable in 2011 has significantly decreased from prior years primarily as a result of implementing Medicares new single bundled payment system as well as some additional commercial contracts that pay us a single bundled payment rate. Therefore, in 2010 and prior, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in commercial and governmental payment rates for EPO had a greater significant influence on our revenues. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past several years we have invested heavily in upgrades to our systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems and processes. In 2011, we continued to upgrade our information technology systems and implemented process changes and will continue to do so in 2012 to improve our ability to capture the necessary patient characteristics and certain other factors under Medicares new bundled payment system. We believe this will help us capture additional reimbursement amounts from Medicare and enhance our overall billing and collection performance. However, as we continue to make upgrades to our systems and processes, or as payors change their systems and requirements, our collection performance as well as our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment could be negatively impacted. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectability of our billings as of the reporting date based upon our actual historical collection experience. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was approximately $330, $337 and $340 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2011, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment decreased by approximately $7 per treatment primarily due to a decline in our Medicare reimbursements as a result of operating in the new single bundled payment system, a decline in the commercial payor mix, and a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. In 2010, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment decreased by approximately $3 per treatment primarily due to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, and a decline in the commercial payor mix, partially offset by an increase of 1.0% in the Medicare composite rate and an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. Commercial payment rates, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are billed separately, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals 47 under the new Medicare bundled payment rate system including our ability to capture all patient characteristics, and changes in the mix of government and commercial patients may materially impact our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in the future. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals, business infrastructure, including the operating costs of our dialysis centers, and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost variability, such as employee benefit costs and insurance costs. Our average clinical hours per treatment in 2011 were relatively flat or increased slightly compared to 2010, which continues to be impacted by our ability to maintain or reduce clinical teammate turnover and improve training and processes. We are always striving for improved productivity levels, however, changes in federal and state policies or regulatory billing requirements can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. In addition, improvements in the U.S. economy could stimulate additional competition for skilled clinical personnel and result in higher teammate turnover which would adversely affect productivity levels. In 2011 and 2010, we experienced an increase in our clinical labor rates of approximately 2.0% in both years, as clinical labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. However, in 2011, we continued to implement certain cost control initiatives to minimize increases in our clinical labor rates. In addition, in 2011, we experienced an approximately 5.0% increase in our EPO costs. Our new agreement with Amgen requires us to purchase EPO in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of our requirements for erythropoiesis stimulation agents and provides for discounted pricing and rebates, which are subject to various conditions including future pricing levels of EPO and data submission, which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to continue to qualify for discount pricing and rebates. In the initial years of the agreement the total rebate opportunity is less than what was provided for in the agreement that expired at the end of 2011, however, the opportunity for us to earn discounts and rebates increases over the term of the agreement. In 2011, we also experienced increases in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new centers opened, and general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. General and administrative expenses represented 9.9% of our net operating revenues in 2011 as compared to 9.0% in 2010. This represents a fairly significant increase in the dollar amount of our general and administrative expenses primarily related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal and compliance matters, professional fees associated with information technology matters and international growth initiatives, transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of DSI and supporting the growth in some of our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. We expect that these levels of expenditures on general and administrative expenses in 2012 will continue and could possibly increase as we seek out new business opportunities within the dialysis industry or to other healthcare services outside of dialysis, making additional investments in our existing long term initiatives, such as our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and the expansion of our international operations, as well as investments in improving our information technology infrastructure and the level of support required for our regulatory compliance and legal matters. Outlook for 2012. Our operating income for 2012 is expected to be in the range of $1,200 million to $1,300 million. We also expect our operating cash flows for 2012 to be in the range of $950 million to $1,050 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks and uncertainties, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates under the Medicare ESRD program or other government based programs, the impact of healthcare legislation that was enacted in the United States in March 2010, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex 48 government regulations, current or potential investigations by various government entities and related government or private party proceedings, continued increased competition from large and medium sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us, our ability to complete any acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, or integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire, and expansion of our operations and services to markets outside of the United States, or to businesses outside of dialysis. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the cautionary language contained in the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 43 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. Results of operations We operate principally as a dialysis and related lab services business in the United States but also operate other ancillary services and strategic initiatives. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs, physician services and our international dialysis operations. The U.S. dialysis and related lab services business qualifies as a separately reportable segment and all of the other ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been combined and disclosed in the other segments category. Following is a summary of consolidated operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. The operating results of DSI are included in our operating results effective September 1, 2011. Year ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 6,982 100 % $ 6,438 100 % $ 6,101 100 % Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 4,681 67 % 4,467 69 % 4,242 70 % General and administrative 691 10 % 579 9 % 532 9 % Depreciation and amortization 267 4 % 234 4 % 228 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 198 3 % 171 3 % 161 3 % Goodwill impairment charge 24 Equity investment income (9 ) (9 ) (2 ) Total operating expenses and charges 5,851 84 % 5,441 84 % 5,161 85 % Operating income $ 1,131 16 % $ 997 16 % $ 940 15 % The following table summarizes consolidated net operating revenues: Year ended 2011 2010 2009 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 6,485 $ 6,063 $ 5,784 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives 514 384 334 Total segment revenues 6,999 6,447 6,118 Elimination of intersegment revenues (17 ) (9 ) (17 ) Consolidated net operating revenues $ 6,982 $ 6,438 $ 6,101 49 The following table summarizes consolidated operating income: Year ended 2011(1) 2010 2009 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 1,225 $ 1,039 $ 994 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives loss (54 ) (6 ) (12 ) Total segment operating income 1,171 1,034 982 Reconciling items: Stock based compensation (49 ) (46 ) (44 ) Equity investment income 9 9 2 Consolidated operating income 1,131 997 940 Reconciliation of non GAAP measure: Add: Goodwill impairment charge 24 Non GAAP consolidated operating income $ 1,155 $ 997 $ 940 (1) For the year ended December 31, 2011 we have excluded a non cash goodwill impairment charge from operating expenses and operating income because management believes that this presentation enhances a users understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding a non cash goodwill impairment charge that resulted from a decrease in the implied fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount associated with HomeChoice Partners (HCP), which provides infusion therapy services, during the second quarter of 2011 and is therefore more meaningful and comparable to our prior period results and more indicative of our normal consolidated operating income. Consolidated net operating revenues Consolidated net operating revenues for 2011 increased by approximately $544 million or approximately 8.5% from 2010. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $422 million, principally due to strong volume growth from additional treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions including the acquisition of DSI, partially offset by a decline of $7 in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, primarily from a decrease in our Medicare revenues as a result of operating in the new single bundled payment system, as described above. Consolidated net operating revenues also increased as a result of an increase of approximately $130 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services and from our disease management services. Consolidated net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $337 million or approximately 5.5% from 2009. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $279 million, principally due to an increase in the number of treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decline of $3 in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, as described above, and an increase of approximately $50 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services and from our infusion therapy services. Consolidated operating income Consolidated operating income of $1,131 million for 2011 increased by approximately $134 million, or 13.4%, from 2010 which includes the $24 million HCP goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this item, consolidated operating income would have increased by $158 million, or 15.8%, primarily due to an increase in the dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues as a result of strong volume growth in revenue from additional treatments as a result of non acquired growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decline in our 50 average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $7, as described below. Consolidated operating income also increased as a result of overall lower pharmaceutical costs mainly from a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, additional operating income from the acquisition of DSI and from cost control initiatives. However, consolidated operating income was negatively impacted by higher labor and benefit costs, an increase in our professional fees for compliance and legal initiatives, and for information technology matters, transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of DSI, an increase in EPO pharmaceutical costs and an increase in expenses associated with our international expansion. Consolidated operating income of $997 million for 2010 increased by approximately $57 million, or 6.1%, from 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue as a result of additional treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions in dialysis and related lab services, partially offset by a decline in our average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3, as described below. Operating income also increased as a result of continued cost control initiatives, improved productivity, overall lower pharmaceutical costs and lower operating losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, partially offset by the negative impact on our operating margin from a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, higher labor costs and increases in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Operating segments Dialysis and Related Lab Services Year ended 2011 2010 2009 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, exceptper treatment data) Revenues $ 6,485 $ 6,063 $ 5,784 Segment operating income $ 1,225 $ 1,039 $ 994 Dialysis treatments 19,599,472 17,963,862 16,984,959 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 62,618 57,392 54,352 Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment $ 330 $ 337 $ 340 Net operating revenues Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2011 increased by approximately $422 million or approximately 7.0% from 2010. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to strong volume growth from additional treatments of approximately 9.1% due to an increase in non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions, which includes additional treatments associated with the acquisition of DSI. However, this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $7, or 2.1%. The decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2011, as compared to 2010, was primarily due to a decline in our Medicare reimbursements as a result of operating in the new single bundled payment system, continued decline in the commercial payor mix and a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $279 million or approximately 4.8% from 2009. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 5.8% due to an increase in non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. However, this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3, or 0.9%. The decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2010, as compared to 2009, was primarily due to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals and a decline in the commercial payor mix, partially offset by a 1% increase in the Medicare composite rate and an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. 51 The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues by modality for the year ended December 31, 2011: Revenuepercentages Outpatient hemodialysis centers 81 % Peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis 14 % Hospital inpatient hemodialysis 5 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Approximately 66% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 were from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare assigned plans, representing approximately 89% of our total patients. Over the last several years, we have been experiencing growth in our government based patients that has been outpacing the growth in our commercial patients which has negatively impacted our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment. Our overall percentage of patients and revenues associated with commercial payors continued to decline in 2011. Less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are due directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 6% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. On average we are paid significantly more for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans in the United States than we are for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other government plans such as Medicare assigned plans. Patients covered by commercial health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Nearly all of our net earnings from our dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at established contract rates and others which pay negotiated payment rates based on our usual and customary fee schedule for our out of network patients. If we experience a net overall reduction in our contracted and non contracted commercial rates as a result of these negotiations or restrictions, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors, including our commercial payment rates, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals under the new Medicare bundled payment rate system, including our ability to capture all patient characteristics, changes in the mix of government and commercial patients, and changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are billed separately. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and operating costs of the dialysis centers. The dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $217 and $232 for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The $15 decrease in the per treatment costs in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, continued cost control initiatives, partially offset by higher labor and benefit costs, and higher EPO costs. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $232 and $235 for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The $3 decrease in the per treatment costs in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, a decrease in our overall pharmaceutical costs and continued improvements in productivity, partially offset by higher labor rates. 52 General and administrative expenses. Dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses for the years ended 2011, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $551 million, $471 million and $428 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $80 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to increases in labor and benefit costs, an increase in our professional expenses for legal and compliance initiatives and for information technology matters as well as transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of DSI. The increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $43 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to increases in labor and benefit costs, partially offset by the timing of certain other expenditures. Depreciation and amortization. Dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $260 million, $227 million and $221 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $33 million in depreciation and amortization for dialysis and related lab services in 2011 and $6 million in 2010 were primarily due to growth through new center developments and acquisitions. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for dialysis and related lab services was 2.9% for 2011, 2.7% for 2010, and 2.7% for 2009. The increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts during 2011 was primarily the result of a slowdown in our historical collection experience from some of our non government payors. The current provision level of 3.0% at the end of 2011 may increase if we encounter problems with our billing and collection process as a result of sustained weakness in the U.S. economy. Segment operating income Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2011 increased by approximately $186 million as compared to 2010. The increase in the operating income for 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to strong treatment growth as a result of additional dialysis treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $7 as described above. The dialysis and related lab services operating income also increased as a result of a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, and additional operating income from the acquisition of DSI. However, the dialysis and related lab services operating income was negatively impacted by higher labor and benefit costs, an increase in the cost of EPO, an increase in our professional fees in conjunction with compliance and legal initiatives and for information technology matters as well as transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of DSI. Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2010 increased by approximately $45 million as compared to 2009. The increase in the operating income for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to growth in the number of dialysis treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3 as described above. The dialysis and related lab services operating income also increased as a result of certain cost control initiatives, improved productivity, and overall lower pharmaceutical costs. However, the dialysis and related lab services operating income was negatively impacted by an operating margin decrease due to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, higher labor costs and an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Other Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Year ended 2011 2010 2009 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Revenues $ 514 $ 384 $ 334 Segment operating loss $ (54 ) $ (6 ) $ (12 ) 53 Net operating revenues The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2011 increased by approximately $130 million or 33.9% as compared to 2010, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, and from our disease management services. The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $50 million or 15.0% as compared to 2009, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, and from our infusion therapy services, partially offset by a decline in our net operating revenues in our disease management services as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. Operating expenses Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2011 increased by approximately $179 million from 2010, which includes the $24 million HCP goodwill impairment charged as described below. Excluding this item, ancillary services and strategic initiatives adjusted operating expenses would have increased by $155 million. This increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business, an increase in expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion and an increase in labor and benefit costs. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2010 increased by approximately $43 million from 2009, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business and an increase in labor costs, partially offset by lower operating costs of our disease management services as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. Goodwill In the second quarter of 2011, we determined that circumstances indicated it was more likely than not that the fair value of one of our ancillary businesses, HCP, which provides infusion therapy services, was less than its carrying amount. The primary factor informing our conclusion was the recent decline in the operating performance of HCP caused mainly by rapid expansion. This led management to revise its view of HCPs organizational growth capability and scale back significantly its current plans for HCPs future growth initiatives and to update HCPs forecasts and current operating budgets accordingly. These revisions reflected the current and expected future cash flows that we believed market participants would use in determining the fair value or the HCP business. As a result, in the second quarter of 2011, we estimated that the carrying amount of goodwill related to HCP exceeded its implied fair value by $24 million, resulting in a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of that amount. As of December 31, 2011, after giving effect to this impairment charge, we have approximately $32 million of HCP goodwill remaining. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we finalized our calculation of this impairment charge, which did not change the goodwill impairment charge previously recorded. Segment operating loss Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2011 increased by approximately $48 million from 2010, which includes the $24 million HCP goodwill impairment charge, as described above. Excluding this item, ancillary services and strategic initiatives adjusted operating losses would have increased by $24 million. This increase in operating losses was primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion and a deterioration in the operating performance of our infusion therapy services, partially offset by an increase in the operating performance of our pharmacy business, and in our vascular access services. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2010 decreased by approximately $6 million from 2009. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to volume growth in revenues associated with our pharmacy business, and a decrease in operating losses in our disease management business as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. 54 Corporate level charges Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation of approximately $49 million for 2011 increased by approximately $3 million from 2010. Stock based compensation of approximately $46 million for 2010 increased by approximately $2 million from 2009. The increase in 2011 resulted from an increase in the overall grant date fair value for the grant years that contributed expense to 2011, driven by both an increase in the grant date fair value of 2011 grants over that for recent years and an increase in the number of awards granted in 2011 over 2010. The increase in 2010 resulted principally from an increase in the overall grant date fair value for the grant years that contributed expense to 2010, driven in part by a substantial increase in the grant date fair value of 2010 grants over that for recent years offset by a significant reduction in the number of awards granted in 2010. Debt expense. Debt expense for 2011, 2010, and 2009 consisted of interest expense of approximately $231 million, $172 million, and $176 million, respectively, including the amortization and accretion of debt discounts and premiums and the amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $10 million in 2011, $9 million in 2010 and $10 million in 2009. The increase in interest expense in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily related to additional borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities that were issued in the fourth quarter of 2010 and additional borrowings associated with the new Term Loan A 2 that contain significantly higher interest rates than our previous facility. In addition, debt expense in 2011 was also impacted by the amount of interest rate swaps that resulted in a higher overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Term Loan A and from the amortization of an interest rate cap premium associated with our Term Loan B. However, debt expense in 2011 benefited from lower rates and lower outstanding balances associated with our new senior notes that were issued in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2011 was 5.28% as compared to 4.68% in 2010. The decrease in interest expense in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily related to lower average outstanding principal balances on our previously outstanding Term Loan A, lower average outstanding principal balances on our previously outstanding senior notes, lower interest rates associated with the issuance of our New Senior Notes and a decrease in our weighted average effective interest rate on the Term Loan B as a result of lower notional amounts of fixed rate swap agreements that contained higher rates. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2010 was 4.68% as compared to 4.86% in 2009. However, interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2010 was negatively affected by the refinancing of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities that occurred on October 20, 2010, as the interest rates under our new Senior Secured Credit Facilities are substantially higher than the interest rates under the previous facility. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in the fourth quarter of 2010 was 4.86%. Equity investment income. Equity investment income was approximately $9.0 million in 2011 as compared to $9.0 million in 2010 and $2.4 million in 2009. Equity investment income in 2011 as compared to 2010 was flat but was impacted by an increase in the profitability of certain of our nonconsolidated joint ventures, offset by a decrease in the operating performance of certain other joint ventures. The increase in equity investment income in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the profitability of our nonconsolidated joint ventures. Other income. Other income was approximately $3 million, $3 million, and $4 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, and consisted principally of interest income. Other income in 2011 was slightly down from 2010, primarily as a result of lower average interest rates and lower average cash balances. The decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily the result of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash balances. Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for 2011 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 35.4%, compared with 35.0% and 36.7% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2011 was higher primarily due to non deductible transaction costs associated with the DSI acquisition. 55 Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, and our investments in ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that an impairment review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. These types of adjustments are charged directly to the corresponding operating segment that incurred the charge. Except for the HCP goodwill charge in 2011, there were no other significant impairments or valuation adjustments recognized during the periods presented. Noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $95 million, $79 million and $57 million, respectively. The increases in noncontrolling interests in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to increases in the number of new joint ventures and increases in the profitability of our dialysis related joint ventures. The percentage of dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues generated from dialysis related joint ventures was approximately 18% in both 2011 and 2010. Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2011 and 2010 represented approximately 61 days of revenue for both periods, net of bad debt allowance. Our days outstanding in 2011, represent solid improved cash collections that enabled us to keep pace with our growth in revenue. However, our cash collections in early 2012 could be negatively impacted as Medicare upgrades its systems to meet their new billing requirements. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, approximately $188 million and $153 million in unreserved accounts receivable, respectively, representing approximately 16% and 15% of our total accounts receivable balance, respectively, were more than six months old. During 2011, we experienced improved cash collections from certain government payors and certain commercial payors. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than 1% of our revenues are classified as patient pay. Substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $57 million in 2011 and $46 million in 2010, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Currently, a significant portion of our Medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. However, the payment received from Medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. Such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements, except for potentially limiting the collectability of these Medicare bad debt claims. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2011, our cash balance was $394 million and we had undrawn credit under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $350 million, of which approximately $52 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2011 amounted to $1,180 million, compared with $840 million for 2010. The increase in our operating cash flows in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to improved cash earnings, a reduction in income tax payments and the timing of other working capital items, partially offset by an 56 increase in our accounts receivable balances from growth in revenue. Cash flow from operations in 2011 included cash interest payments of approximately $236 million and cash tax payments of $146 million. Cash flow from operations in 2010 included cash interest payments of approximately $191 million and cash tax payments of $207 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2011 included $436 million for capital asset expenditures, including $176 million for new center developments and relocations, and $260 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $1,077 million for acquisitions. During 2011, we also received $49 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, the majority of these proceeds was either used to repurchase other investments or was used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, during 2011, we received $32 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $101 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $21 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 3.8 million shares of our common stock for approximately $323 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2010 included $279 million for capital asset expenditures, including $120 million for new center developments and relocations, and $159 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $189 million for acquisitions. During 2010, we also received $61 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, during 2010, we received $60 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $84 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $10 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 8.9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $619 million. During 2011, we acquired a total of 178 dialysis centers, eight of which were located outside of the United States, opened 65 new dialysis centers, sold two centers, merged seven centers, and divested a total of 30 dialysis centers in connection with the acquisition of DSI. We also added three dialysis centers under management and administrative service agreements that are located outside of the United States and added one center in which we own a minority equity interest. During 2010, we acquired a total of 41 dialysis centers, opened 65 new dialysis centers, sold six centers, closed 18 centers, and made minority equity investments in three centers that were previously under management and administrative service agreements. Acquisition On September 2, 2011, we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of CDSI I Holding Company, Inc., the parent company of dialysis provider DSI Renal Inc. (DSI), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger for approximately $723 million in net cash, plus the assumption of certain liabilities totaling approximately $6.5 million, subject to certain post closing adjustments. DSI had 113 outpatient dialysis centers that provided services to approximately 8,000 patients in 23 states. We also incurred approximately $22 million in transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2011 associated with this acquisition that are included in general and administrative expenses. Pursuant to a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission on September 2, 2011, we agreed to divest a total of 30 outpatient dialysis centers and several home based dialysis programs in order to complete the acquisition of DSI. In conjunction with the consent order, on September 30, 2011, we completed the sale of 28 outpatient dialysis centers to Dialysis Newco, Inc., or Dialysis Newco, a portfolio company of Frazier Healthcare VI, L.P. and New Enterprise Associates 13, Limited Partnership pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated August 26, 2011. Effective October 31, 2011, we also completed the sale of two additional outpatient dialysis centers to Dialysis Newco that were previously pending state regulatory approval. We anticipate receiving total net cash consideration of approximately $82.0 million for all of the outpatient dialysis centers that were divested. 57 2011 capital structure changes and other items On August 26, 2011, we entered into an Increase Joinder Agreement under our existing Senior Secured Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Increase Joinder Agreement, we increased the revolving credit facility by $100 million, to a total of $350 million, and entered into an additional $200 million Term Loan A 2. The new Term Loan A 2 required a principal payment of $0.5 million on December 31, 2011 and thereafter requires annual principal payments of $2.0 million with the balance of $191.5 million due in 2016, and bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.00%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.50% subject to a rating based step down to 3.25%. During the year ended December 31, 2011 we made mandatory principal payments under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $50 million on the Term Loan A, $0.5 million on Term Loan A 2 and $17.5 million on the Term Loan B. Interest rate swaps and caps In January 2011, we entered into nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1.0 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011, as a means of hedging our exposure to and volatility from variable based interest rate changes as part of our overall risk management strategy. As of December 31, 2011, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $950 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan A to fixed rates ranging from 1.59% to 1.64%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 4.11%, including the Term Loan A margin of 2.50%. The swap agreements expire by September 30, 2014 and require monthly interest payments. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we accrued net charges of $12.6 million from these swaps which are included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2011, the total fair value of these swap agreements was a liability of $23.1 million. We estimate that approximately $10.9 million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2011 will be reclassified into income over the next year. In addition, in January 2011, we also entered into five interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling $1.25 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 4.00% on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan B debt. The cap agreements expire on September 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2011, the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of $1.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded $5.2 million, net of tax, as a decrease to other comprehensive income due to unrealized valuation changes in the cap agreements, net of the amortization of the interest rate cap premiums that were reclassified into net income. As a result of the swap and cap agreements, our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 4.61%, based upon the current margins in effect of 2.50% for the Term Loan A, 3.50% for the Term Loan A 2 and 3.00% for the Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, interest rates on our Term Loan A 2 and Term Loan B are set at their LIBOR floors plus their interest rate margins. Interest rates on our senior notes and Term Loan A are fixed and economically fixed, respectively, with rates on the $1.25 billion of our Term Loan B subject to interest rate caps. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2011 was 5.28% and as of December 31, 2011 was 5.27%. Stock repurchases During 2011, we repurchased a total of 3,794,686 shares of our common stock for $323.3 million, or an average price of $85.21 per share, pursuant to a previously announced authorization by the Board of Directors on 58 November 3, 2010, that authorized an additional $800 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions, the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2011 was $358.2 million. We have not repurchased any additional shares of our common stock from January 1, 2012 through February 24, 2012. This stock repurchase program has no expiration date. Stock based compensation Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the straight line amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in all prior periods. During 2011, we granted 2,707,500 stock settled stock appreciation rights with a grant date fair value of $59.4 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 4.2 years, and also granted 150,246 stock units with a grant date fair value of $12.8 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 3.1 years. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recognized $48.7 million and $45.6 million, respectively, in stock based compensation expense for stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock options, stock units and discounted employee stock plan purchases, which is primarily included in general and administrative expenses. The estimated tax benefits recorded for this stock based compensation in 2011 and 2010 were $18.4 million and $17.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, there was $91.3 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock settled compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we received $5.4 million and $48.7 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $38.2 million and $26.7 million, respectively, in total actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. Other items On July 22, 2010, we entered into a First National Service Provider Agreement, or the Agreement, with NxStage Medical Inc., or NxStage. Under the terms of the Agreement we have the ability to continue to purchase NxStage System One hemodialysis machines and related supplies at discount prices. In addition, we may, in lieu of cash rebate, vest in warrants to purchase NxStage common stock based upon achieving certain System One home patient growth targets by June 30, 2011, 2012 and 2013. The warrants are exercisable for up to a cumulative total of 5.5 million shares of common stock over the three years at an initial exercise price of $14.22 per share. From the period July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011, we earned warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of NxStage common stock. In October 2011 we exercised our right to purchase 250,000 shares of NxStage common stock at $14.22 per share, for a total of approximately $3.6 million and in February 2012, we sold all 250,000 shares for approximately $5.2 million. In July 2010, we announced that we will construct a new corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado. In July 2010, we acquired the land and existing improvements for approximately $12 million. Effective December 18, 2010, we entered into a construction agreement for the construction of the new building. We currently estimate the total construction costs and other project costs of the building will be approximately $95 million. Construction began in early 2011, and is still estimated to be complete in the second half of 2012. Through December 31, 2011, we have paid construction costs and architecture and other design fees totaling approximately $49 million. 2010 capital structure changes On October 20, 2010, we entered into a $3,000 million Senior Secured Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), consisting of a five year $250 million revolving line of credit, a five year $1,000 million Term Loan 59 A and a six year $1,750 million Term Loan B. We also have the right to request an increase to the borrowing capacity to a total aggregate principal amount of not more than $4,000 million subject to bank participation. The revolving line of credit and the Term Loan A initially bore interest at LIBOR plus an interest rate margin of 2.75% until June 30, 2011, when the interest rate margin was reduced to 2.50%. The interest rate margin is still subject to adjustment depending upon our leverage ratio and can range from 2.25% to 2.75%. The Term Loan A requires annual principal payments of $50 million in 2011, $50 million in 2012, $100 million in 2013, and $150 million in 2014, with the balance of $650 million due in 2015. The Term Loan B bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.50%) plus 3.00% subject to a ratings based step down to 2.75%. The Term Loan B requires annual principal payments of $17.5 million in each year from 2011 through 2015 with the balance of $1,663 million due in 2016. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of DaVitas and its guarantors assets. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants such as various restrictions on investments, acquisitions, the payment of dividends, redemptions and acquisitions of capital stock, capital expenditures and other indebtedness, as well as limitations on the amount of tangible net assets in non guarantor subsidiaries. However, many of these restrictions will not apply as long as our leverage ratio is below 3.50:1.00. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires compliance with financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio and a leverage ratio that determines the interest rate margins as described above. On October 20, 2010, we also issued $775 million aggregate principal amount of 6  3/8% senior notes due 2018 and $775 million aggregate principal amount of 6  5/8% senior notes due 2020 (the New Senior Notes). The New Senior Notes will pay interest on May 1 and November 1, of each year beginning May 1, 2011. The New Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally to other unsecured senior indebtedness. The New Senior Notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. We may redeem some or all of the 6  3/8% senior notes at any time on or after November 1, 2013 at certain redemption prices and may redeem some or all of the 6 5/8% senior notes at any time on or after November 1, 2014 at certain redemption prices. We received total proceeds of $4,300 million from these transactions, $2,750 million from the borrowings on Term Loan A and Term Loan B and an additional $1,550 million from the issuance of the New Senior Notes. We used a portion of the proceeds to pay off the outstanding principal balances of our existing senior secured credit facilities plus accrued interest totaling $1,795 million and to purchase pursuant to a cash tender offer $558 million of the outstanding principal balances of our $700 million 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $731 million of the outstanding balances of our $850 million 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015 (the Existing Notes), plus accrued interest totaling $1,297 million. The total amount paid for the Existing Notes was $1,019.06 per $1,000 principal amount of the 6  5/8% senior notes and $1,038.75 per $1,000 principal amount of the 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes. This resulted in us paying a cash tender premium of $39 million in order to extinguish this portion of the Existing Notes. On November 19, 2010, we redeemed the remaining outstanding balance of the existing 6  5/8% senior notes of $142 million at 101.656% per $1,000 and the remaining outstanding balance of the existing 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes of $119 million at 103.625% per $1,000 plus accrued interest totaling $265 million. In addition, we paid a call premium totaling $7 million. We also paid an additional $74 million in fees, discounts and other expenses. As a result of the above transactions, we received approximately $823 million in excess cash which we have been using for general purposes and other opportunities, including share repurchases, acquisitions and other growth investments. In connection with these transactions, we expensed debt refinancing and redemption charges totaling $70.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, which includes the write off of certain existing deferred financing costs and other new financing costs, the cash tender and call premiums, as described above and other expenses. On June 7, 2010, we redeemed $200 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6  5/8% senior notes due 2013, at a price of 101.656% plus accrued interest. As a result of this transaction, we expensed debt redemption charges of $4.1 million, which includes the call premium and the net write off of other finance costs. 60 Senior Secured Credit Facilities and senior and senior subordinated notes During 2010, we made mandatory principal payments totaling $65.6 million on our prior outstanding Term Loan A. We did not make any principal payments on Term Loan B during 2010, nor were we required to. All of the outstanding balances under the prior Term Loan A, Term Loan B and the senior and senior subordinated notes were extinguished as part of our debt refinancing transactions that occurred on October 20, 2010, as described above. Stock repurchases During 2010, we repurchased a total of 8,918,760 shares of our common stock for $618.5 million, or an average price of $69.35 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. Interest rate swaps Our previous interest rate swap agreements expired on September 30, 2010. The agreements that were effective during 2010 had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 4.05% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.84% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the Term Loan B margin of 1.50%. During 2010 and 2009, we accrued net cash obligations of approximately $9.1 million and $17.3 million, respectively, from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 4.05%, based upon the current margins in effect of 2.75% for the Term Loan A and 3.00% for the Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, interest rates on our Term Loan B are set at its LIBOR floors plus its interest rate margin and interest rates on our senior notes are fixed. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2010 was 4.68% and as of December 31, 2010 was 4.94%. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases and letters of credit as well as potential obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated businesses and to dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several joint ventures and for some of our non wholly owned subsidiaries in the form of put provisions. If these put provisions were exercised, we would be required to purchase the third party owners noncontrolling interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the noncontrolling interests put to us, which is intended to approximate fair value. For additional information see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several other dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties or centers in which we own an equity investment, as well as to physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under management and administrative services agreements. 61 The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011 (in millions): Less Than1 year 2 3years 4 5years After5 years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 85 $ 297 $ 2,531 $ 1,557 $ 4,470 Interest payments on the senior notes 100 202 202 279 783 Interest payments on the Term Loan B(1) 79 155 137 371 Interest payments on the Term Loan A 2(2) 9 18 16 43 Capital lease obligations 2 5 4 32 43 Operating leases 258 444 370 636 1,708 Construction of the new corporate headquarters 46 46 $ 579 $ 1,121 $ 3,260 $ 2,504 $ 7,464 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 52 $ $ $ $ 52 Noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions 260 98 76 44 478 Pay fixed swaps potential obligations 11 12 23 Operating capital advances 4 4 $ 327 $ 110 $ 76 $ 44 $ 557 (1) Assuming no changes to LIBOR based interest rates as the Term Loan B currently bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.50%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.00%. (2) Assuming no changes to LIBOR based interest rates as the Term Loan A 2 currently bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.00%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.50% The pay fixed swap obligations represent the estimated fair market values of our interest rate swap agreements as reported by various broker dealers that are based upon relevant observable market inputs as well as other current market conditions that existed as of December 31, 2011, and represent the estimated potential obligation that we would be required to pay based upon the estimated future settlement of each specific tranche over the term of the swap agreements, assuming no future changes in the forward yield curve. The actual amount of our obligation associated with these swaps in the future will depend upon changes in the LIBOR based interest rates that can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions, and other relevant factors that can affect the fair market value of these swap agreements. In addition to the above commitments, we are obligated to purchase a certain amount of our hemodialysis products and supplies at fixed prices through 2015 from Gambro Renal Products, Inc. in connection with the Product Supply Agreement. Our total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs in each year. In January 2010, we entered into an agreement with Fresenius which committed us to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies from them through 2013. Our total expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2011 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs. The actual amount of purchases in future years from Gambro Renal Products and Fresenius will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, and in the case of the Product Supply Agreement, Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. In November 2011, we entered into a seven year Sourcing and Supply Agreement with Amgen USA Inc. that expires on December 31, 2018. Under the terms of the agreement we will purchase EPO in amounts 62 necessary to meet no less than 90% of our requirements for erythropoiesis stimulating agents. The actual amount of EPO that we will purchase from Amgen will depend upon the amount of EPO administered during dialysis as prescribed by physicians and the overall number of patients that we serve. Settlements of approximately $12 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made. Contingencies The information in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements of this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, contingencies and temporary equity. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly and annual variable compensation accruals, purchase accounting valuation estimates, fair value estimates and stock based compensation are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Effective January 1, 2011, our reimbursements from Medicare became subject to certain variations under Medicares new single bundled payment rate system whereby our reimbursements can be adjusted for certain patient characteristics and certain other factors. Our revenue recognition depends upon our ability to effectively capture, document and bill for Medicares base payment rate and these other factors. In addition, as a result of the potential range of variations that can occur in our reimbursements from Medicare under the new single bundled payment rate system, our revenue recognition is now subject to a greater degree of estimating risk. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans 63 with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, slow down in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 142,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as 6% of consolidated operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairments of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers or other operations. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year, and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. We are required to assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and to also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain and future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. 64 Purchase accounting valuation estimates. We make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and contractual as well as non contractual contingencies associated with our acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Fair value estimates. We have recorded certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests (temporary equity) subject to put provisions at fair value. The FASB defines fair value which is measured based upon certain valuation techniques that include inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. We have measured the fair values of our applicable assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions based upon certain market inputs and assumptions that are either observable or unobservable in determining fair values and have also classified these assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels. The fair value of our investments available for sale are based upon quoted market prices from active markets and the fair value of our swap and cap agreements were based upon valuation models utilizing the income approach and commonly accepted valuation techniques that use inputs from closing prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as well as other relevant observable market inputs at quoted intervals such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, implied volatility and credit default swap pricing. For our noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions we have estimated the fair values of these based upon either the higher of a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. During the second quarter of 2010, we refined the methodology used to estimate the fair value of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions by eliminating an annual inflation factor that was previously applied to the put provisions until they became exercisable. We believe that eliminating an annual inflation factor will result in a better representation of the estimated actual fair value of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. The estimate of the fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners noncontrolling interests. Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the straight line amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk free interest rates. Significant new accounting standards On January 1, 2012, we adopted FASBs Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. This standard amends the current two step goodwill impairment test required under the existing accounting guidance. This amendment allows entities the option to first assess certain qualitative factors to ascertain whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount to determine if the two step impairment test is necessary. If an entity concludes that certain events or circumstances prove that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then an entity is required to proceed to step one of the two step goodwill impairment test. This standard is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 65 On January 1, 2012, we adopted FASBs ASU No. 2011 07, Health Care Entities Presentation and Disclosure of Patient Service Revenue, Provision for Bad Debts, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This standard amends the current presentation and disclosure requirements for Health Care Entities that recognize significant amounts of patient service revenue at the time the services are rendered without assessing the patients ability to pay. This standard requires health care entities to reclassify the provision for bad debts from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenues. In addition, this standard requires more disclosure on the policies for recognizing revenue, assessing bad debts, as well as quantitative and qualitative information regarding changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts. This standard is applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented and is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard will require us to change the presentation in our financial statements. On January 1, 2012, we adopted FASBs ASU No. 2011 05, Comprehensive Income Presentation of Comprehensive Income. This standard amends the current presentation requirements for comprehensive income by eliminating the presentation of the components of other comprehensive income within the statement of equity. This standard allows two options on how to present the various components of comprehensive income. These options are either to report the components of comprehensive income separately on the income statement or to present total other comprehensive income and the components of other comprehensive income in a separate statement. This standard does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item must be reclassified into net income. This standard is applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard will require us to change the presentation in our financial statements. On January 1, 2012, we adopted FASBs ASU No. 2011 04, Fair Value Measurement. This standard amends the current fair value measurement and disclosure requirements to improve comparability between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The intent of this standard is to update the disclosures that describe several of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and to enhance disclosures about fair value measurements which will improve consistency between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. This standard does not change the application of the requirements on fair value measurements and disclosures. This standard is applied prospectively and is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2011. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average LIBOR rates in effect for all debt tranches plus interest rate margins in effect at December 31, 2011. The Term Loan A margin currently in effect is 2.50% and along with the revolving line of credit is subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio.

For the Term Loan A, each tranche bears interest at a LIBOR rate that is determined by the duration of such tranche plus an interest rate margin. The LIBOR variable component of the interest rate for each tranche is reset as such tranche matures and a new tranche is established. LIBOR can fluctuate significantly depending upon conditions in the credit and capital markets. The Term Loan A 2 and Term Loan B are subject to LIBOR floors of 1.00% and 1.50%, respectively. Because LIBOR, as of December 31, 2011, was lower than either of these floors, the interest rates on the Term Loan A 2 and the Term Loan B are treated as fixed for purposes of the table above. We have included both of these Term Loans in the fixed rate totals in the table above until such time as the LIBOR based component of our interest rate exceeds 1.00% on the Term Loan A 2 and 1.50% on the Term Loan B. At such time, we will then be subject to LIBOR based interest rate volatility on the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on all of the Term Loan A 2, as well as for the Term Loan B, but limited to a maximum rate of 4.00% on $1.25 billion of outstanding principal debt on the Term Loan B. The remaining $483 million outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan B is subject to LIBOR based interest rate volatility above a floor of 1.50%. In January 2011, we entered into nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1.0 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011, as a means of hedging our exposure to and volatility from variable based interest rate changes as part of our overall risk management strategy. As of December 31, 2011, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $950 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan A to fixed rates ranging from 1.59% to 1.64%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 4.11%, including the Term Loan A margin of 2.50%. The swap agreements expire by September 30, 2014 and require monthly interest payments. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we accrued net charges of $12.6 million from these swaps which are included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2011, the total fair value of these swap agreements was a liability of $23.1 million. We estimate that approximately $10.9 million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2011 will be reclassified into income over the next year. In addition, in January 2011, we also entered into five interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling $1.25 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 4.00% on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan B debt. The cap agreements expire on September 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2011, the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of $1.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded $5.2 million, net of tax, as a decrease to other comprehensive income due to unrealized valuation changes in the cap agreements, net of the amortization of the interest rate cap premiums that were reclassified into net income. As a result of the swap and cap agreements, our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 4.61%, based upon the current margins in effect of 2.50% for the Term Loan A, 3.50% for the Term Loan A 2 and 3.00% for the Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2011. 67 As of December 31, 2011, interest rates on our Term Loan A 2 and Term Loan B are set at their LIBOR floors plus their interest rate margins. Interest rates on our senior notes and Term Loan A are fixed and economically fixed, respectively, with rates on the $1.25 billion of our Term Loan B subject to interest rate caps. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2011 was 5.28% and as of December 31, 2011 was 5.27%. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $0.6 million, $11.1 million, and $8.5 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any significant foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this report. The following table presents selected consolidated financial and operating data for the periods indicated. Effective January 1, 2009, we were required to present consolidated net income attributable to us and to noncontrolling interests on the face of the consolidated statement of income, which changed the presentation of minority interests (noncontrolling interests) in our consolidated statements of income. These consolidated financial results have been recast for all prior periods presented to reflect the retrospective application of adopting these new presentation and disclosure requirements for noncontrolling interests.

Operating expenses and charges in 2007 also includes $6,779 of gains from insurance settlements related to Hurricane Katrina and a fire that destroyed one center. 41 (2) Debt expense in 2007 includes the write off of approximately $4.4 million of deferred financing costs associated with our principal prepayments on our term loans. (3) Other income, net, includes $5,868 in 2007 of gains from the sale of investment securities. (4) During 2011, we divested a total of 28 outpatient dialysis centers in conjunction with a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission on September 30, 2011 in order for us to complete the acquisition of DSI. In addition, we also completed the sale of two additional centers that were previously pending state regulatory approval in conjunction with the acquisition of DSI on October 31, 2011. The operating results of the historical DaVita divested centers are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. In addition, the operating results for the DSI divested centers are reflected as discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements beginning September 1, 2011.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward looking statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements that do not concern historical facts are forward looking statements and include, among other things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and or strategies for the future. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, operating cash flow, estimated tax rates, capital expenditures, the development of new centers and center acquisitions, government and commercial payment rates, revenue estimating risk and the impact of our related level of indebtedness on our financial performance, including earnings per share. These statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements, including, but not limited to, risks resulting from uncertainties associated with government regulations, general economic and other market conditions, competition, accounting estimates, the variability of our cash flows, the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates under the Medicare ESRD program or other government based programs, the impact of health care legislation that was enacted in the United States in March 2010, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations, current or potential investigations by various government entities and related government or private party proceedings, continued increased competition from large and medium sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us, our ability to complete any acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, or integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire, expansion of our operations and services to markets outside the United States, or to businesses outside of dialysis and the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of kidney dialysis services, primarily in the United States, through a network of approximately 1,809 outpatient dialysis centers and approximately 900 hospitals, located in the United States throughout 43 states and District of Columbia, serving a total of approximately 142,000 patients. We estimate that we have approximately a 32% market share in the United States based upon the number of patients that we serve. In 2011, our overall network of dialysis centers increased by 208 centers primarily as a result of acquisitions and from opening new centers. In September 2011 we acquired DSI, a medium sized dialysis provider, for approximately $723 million in net cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. DSI contributed a net 83 dialysis centers, after which we agreed to divest a total of 30 dialysis centers in order to complete the acquisition of DSI. In addition, the overall number of patients that we serve in the U.S. increased by approximately 13.0% as compared to 2010. In addition, as of December 31, 2011, we provided dialysis and administrative services to a total of 11 outpatient dialysis centers located in three countries outside of the United States. Our international dialysis operations are currently in a start up phase in which we primarily commenced operations during the fourth quarter of 2011. The total net operating revenues generated from our international operations were not material 43 during 2011 and are included as a component of our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. Therefore, all references in this document to dialysis and related lab services continue to refer only to our U.S. dialysis and related lab services business for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our national scale and size, among other things, allows us to provide industry leading quality care with superior clinical outcomes that attracts patients and referring physicians, as well as qualified medical directors, provides our patient base with convenient locations and access to a full range of services and provides us the ability to effectively control certain costs while maintaining strong compliance programs. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three stakeholders our patients, our business partners, and our teammates represents the major driver of our long term performance, although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes as measured by DQI have improved over each of the past three years which we believe directly decreases patient mortalities. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States and generally exceed the dialysis outcome quality indicators of the National Kidney Foundation. In addition, over the past several years our teammate turnover has remained relatively constant, which we believe was a major contributor to our continued clinical performance improvements and also a major driver of our ability to maintain or improve clinical hours per treatment. We will continue to focus on these stakeholders and our clinical outcomes as we believe these are fundamental long term value drivers. Our overall financial performance was strong for 2011 and was characterized by strong treatment volume growth, primarily from acquisitions and non acquired growth rates and by decreased operating costs from a decline in the utilization of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals due to continued evolution of clinical practices and physicians responding to the new FDA label for EPO. Our major financial operating performance indicators in 2011 as compared to 2010 were as follows: consolidated revenue growth of approximately 8.5%; an increase of approximately 9.1% in the overall number of treatments that we provided; normalized non acquired treatment growth of 4.6%; consolidated operating income growth of approximately 13.4%, which includes the impact of a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 2.4%; effective operating cost control initiatives; and strong operating cash flows of $1,180 million. However, we believe that 2012 will continue to be challenging as we implement some additional Medicare billing requirements and as we implement system and process upgrades to enhance our ability to capture certain patient characteristics that can impact our overall reimbursements from Medicare. In addition, there remains significant scrutiny and uncertainty around the utilization of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, which along with pharmaceutical cost increases and changes in certain government policies, can have a significant impact on our operating results. We are also committed to our international expansion plans that will continue to require a significant investment in 2012. In addition, if the percentage of our patients with commercial payors continues to deteriorate this would also impact our operating results. Approximately 93% of our 2011 consolidated net operating revenues were derived directly from our dialysis and related lab services business. Approximately 81% of our 2011 dialysis and related lab services revenues were derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in the 1,776 U.S. centers that we consolidate. Other dialysis 44 services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, hospital inpatient hemodialysis services and management and administrative services. These services collectively accounted for the balance of our 2011 dialysis and related lab services revenues. Our other business operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. These consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs, physician services and our international dialysis operations. These services generated approximately $514 million of net operating revenues in 2011, representing approximately 7% of our consolidated net operating revenues. We currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives including our continued expansion into certain international markets as we work to develop successful new business operations in the United States as well as outside the United States. However, any significant change in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes in these strategic initiatives could result in a write off or an impairment of some or all of our investments, including goodwill, which occurred in 2011 when we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge relating to our infusion therapy business, and could also result in significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are: the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week, as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services; and average dialysis revenue per treatment. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, which we believe is influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, our relationships with referring physicians, together with the quality of our clinical care which can lead to reduced patient mortalities, and our ability to open and acquire new dialysis centers. In 2011, we were able to increase our overall network of patients that we serviced in the U.S. by approximately 13% as compared to 2010. Our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in 2011 was primarily driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, commercial and government payment rates, our billing and collecting operations performance, and the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are separately billable. Beginning in 2011, with the implementation of Medicares new single bundled payment rate system, the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals had a lesser impact on our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment since payment for these pharmaceuticals is included in a single bundled payment. In addition, some of our commercial contracts covering certain patients also pay us under a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are significantly higher than Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis revenue per treatment. The percentage of commercial patients covered under contracted plans as compared to commercial patients with out of network providers can also significantly affect our average dialysis revenue per treatment. In 2011, the growth of our government based patients continued to outpace the growth of our commercial patients, which has been a trend that we have experienced for the past several years. We believe the growth in our government based patients is driven primarily by improved mortality and the current economic environment, which impacts the number of individuals that are covered under commercial insurance plans. This trend has negatively impacted our average dialysis revenue per treatment as a result of receiving a larger proportion of our revenue from government based payors, such as Medicare, that reimburse us at lower payment rates. 45 The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011: Revenues Medicare and Medicare assigned plans 58 % Medicaid and Medicaid assigned plans 5 % Other government based programs 3 % Total government based programs 66 % Commercial (including hospital dialysis services) 34 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Government payment rates in the United States are principally determined by federal Medicare and state Medicaid policy. These payment rates have historically had limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reduction as federal and state governments face increasing budget pressures. On January 1, 2011 we implemented Medicares new payment system in which all ESRD payments are made under a single bundled payment rate that, beginning in 2012, will provide for an annual inflation adjustment based upon a market basket index, less a productivity adjustment. Also beginning in 2012, the rule provides for up to a 2% annual payment withhold that can be earned back by the facilities that meet certain defined clinical performance standards. The new payment system reimburses providers based upon a single bundled or average payment for each Medicare treatment provided. This new bundled payment amount is designed to cover all dialysis services which were historically included in the composite rate and all separately billable ESRD services such as pharmaceuticals and laboratory costs. In the past the amount of services that were separately billable accounted for approximately 30% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues. The new bundled payment rate is adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a geographic wage index and certain other factors. The initial 2011 bundled payment rate included reductions of 2.0% from the prior reimbursement and further reduced overall rates by 5.94% tied to an expanded list of case mix adjustors which can be earned back based upon the presence of certain patient characteristics and co modalities at the time of treatment. There are also other provisions which may impact payment including an outlier pool and a low volume facility adjustment with regard to the expanded list of case mix adjusters. These are difficult and, in some cases, have not been possible for our dialysis centers to document and track, which has resulted in lower reimbursement amounts than we would otherwise have received. On April 1, 2011, CMS released an interim final rule correcting the 3.1% transition adjustment factor to properly update the number of ESRD facilities that elected to opt fully into the new Prospective Payment System (PPS). This new rule is prospective and as a result, effective April 1, 2011 we began recognizing revenues in accordance with the new rule, which resulted in an increase in Medicare revenue per treatment of approximately 3.1% in comparison to our levels recorded in the first quarter of 2011. This reduced our transition adjustment to zero for the balance of 2011 and to an aggregate of approximately 0.75% for 2011. On November 1, 2011, CMS issued the final ESRD Prospective Payment System (PPS) rule for 2012. The base rate will increase by 2.1%, representing a market basket increase of 3.0% less a productivity adjustment of 0.9%. The increase in the final base rate for 2012 (2.1%) is slightly greater than the increase of 1.8% stated in the proposed 2012 ESRD PPS rule published in July 2011, and higher than the 1.0% increase recommended by MedPAC. In 2012 and beyond, the ESRD PPS system includes additional quality measures that could result in decreased payments if a dialysis facility fails to meet the standards. Also, beginning January 1, 2014, certain oral only ESRD drugs (currently paid separately to pharmacies under Medicare Part D) will be included in the ESRD bundled payment to dialysis facilities. It is currently unclear how CMS will price the oral only drugs for inclusion in the ESRD bundle in 2014. We believe the new payment system presents additional operating clinical and financial risks that our dialysis centers or billing and other systems may not accurately document and track the appropriate patient specific characteristics, resulting in a reduction or overpayment in the amounts of the payments that we would otherwise be entitled to receive. 46 Dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Our commercial payment rates also include payments for out of network patients that on average are higher than our in network contract rates. In 2011, we were successful in increasing some of our commercial payment rates which contributed to an increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment, which helped offset some of the overall decline in our average dialysis revenue per treatment. In 2011, we also entered into some commercial contracts covering certain patients that will primarily pay us a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided to these patients. We are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors, and payors are aggressive in their negotiations. If our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, this would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, if there are sustained or increased job losses in the United States as a result of current economic conditions, or depending upon changes to the healthcare regulatory system, we could experience a decrease in the number of patients under commercial plans. Approximately 4% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, were from physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are separately billable, with EPO accounting for approximately 3% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. The impact of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals on our overall revenues that are separately billable in 2011 has significantly decreased from prior years primarily as a result of implementing Medicares new single bundled payment system as well as some additional commercial contracts that pay us a single bundled payment rate. Therefore, in 2010 and prior, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in commercial and governmental payment rates for EPO had a greater significant influence on our revenues. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past several years we have invested heavily in upgrades to our systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems and processes. In 2011, we continued to upgrade our information technology systems and implemented process changes and will continue to do so in 2012 to improve our ability to capture the necessary patient characteristics and certain other factors under Medicares new bundled payment system. We believe this will help us capture additional reimbursement amounts from Medicare and enhance our overall billing and collection performance. However, as we continue to make upgrades to our systems and processes, or as payors change their systems and requirements, our collection performance as well as our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment could be negatively impacted. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectability of our billings as of the reporting date based upon our actual historical collection experience. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was approximately $330, $337 and $340 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2011, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment decreased by approximately $7 per treatment primarily due to a decline in our Medicare reimbursements as a result of operating in the new single bundled payment system, a decline in the commercial payor mix, and a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. In 2010, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment decreased by approximately $3 per treatment primarily due to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, and a decline in the commercial payor mix, partially offset by an increase of 1.0% in the Medicare composite rate and an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. Commercial payment rates, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are billed separately, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals 47 under the new Medicare bundled payment rate system including our ability to capture all patient characteristics, and changes in the mix of government and commercial patients may materially impact our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in the future. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals, business infrastructure, including the operating costs of our dialysis centers, and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost variability, such as employee benefit costs and insurance costs. Our average clinical hours per treatment in 2011 were relatively flat or increased slightly compared to 2010, which continues to be impacted by our ability to maintain or reduce clinical teammate turnover and improve training and processes. We are always striving for improved productivity levels, however, changes in federal and state policies or regulatory billing requirements can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. In addition, improvements in the U.S. economy could stimulate additional competition for skilled clinical personnel and result in higher teammate turnover which would adversely affect productivity levels. In 2011 and 2010, we experienced an increase in our clinical labor rates of approximately 2.0% in both years, as clinical labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. However, in 2011, we continued to implement certain cost control initiatives to minimize increases in our clinical labor rates. In addition, in 2011, we experienced an approximately 5.0% increase in our EPO costs. Our new agreement with Amgen requires us to purchase EPO in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of our requirements for erythropoiesis stimulation agents and provides for discounted pricing and rebates, which are subject to various conditions including future pricing levels of EPO and data submission, which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to continue to qualify for discount pricing and rebates. In the initial years of the agreement the total rebate opportunity is less than what was provided for in the agreement that expired at the end of 2011, however, the opportunity for us to earn discounts and rebates increases over the term of the agreement. In 2011, we also experienced increases in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new centers opened, and general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. General and administrative expenses represented 9.9% of our net operating revenues in 2011 as compared to 9.0% in 2010. This represents a fairly significant increase in the dollar amount of our general and administrative expenses primarily related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal and compliance matters, professional fees associated with information technology matters and international growth initiatives, transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of DSI and supporting the growth in some of our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. We expect that these levels of expenditures on general and administrative expenses in 2012 will continue and could possibly increase as we seek out new business opportunities within the dialysis industry or to other healthcare services outside of dialysis, making additional investments in our existing long term initiatives, such as our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and the expansion of our international operations, as well as investments in improving our information technology infrastructure and the level of support required for our regulatory compliance and legal matters. Outlook for 2012. Our operating income for 2012 is expected to be in the range of $1,200 million to $1,300 million. We also expect our operating cash flows for 2012 to be in the range of $950 million to $1,050 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks and uncertainties, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates under the Medicare ESRD program or other government based programs, the impact of healthcare legislation that was enacted in the United States in March 2010, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex 48 government regulations, current or potential investigations by various government entities and related government or private party proceedings, continued increased competition from large and medium sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us, our ability to complete any acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, or integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire, and expansion of our operations and services to markets outside of the United States, or to businesses outside of dialysis. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the cautionary language contained in the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 43 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. Results of operations We operate principally as a dialysis and related lab services business in the United States but also operate other ancillary services and strategic initiatives. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs, physician services and our international dialysis operations. The U.S. dialysis and related lab services business qualifies as a separately reportable segment and all of the other ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been combined and disclosed in the other segments category. Following is a summary of consolidated operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. The operating results of DSI are included in our operating results effective September 1, 2011. Year ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 6,982 100 % $ 6,438 100 % $ 6,101 100 % Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 4,681 67 % 4,467 69 % 4,242 70 % General and administrative 691 10 % 579 9 % 532 9 % Depreciation and amortization 267 4 % 234 4 % 228 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 198 3 % 171 3 % 161 3 % Goodwill impairment charge 24 Equity investment income (9 ) (9 ) (2 ) Total operating expenses and charges 5,851 84 % 5,441 84 % 5,161 85 % Operating income $ 1,131 16 % $ 997 16 % $ 940 15 % The following table summarizes consolidated net operating revenues: Year ended 2011 2010 2009 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 6,485 $ 6,063 $ 5,784 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives 514 384 334 Total segment revenues 6,999 6,447 6,118 Elimination of intersegment revenues (17 ) (9 ) (17 ) Consolidated net operating revenues $ 6,982 $ 6,438 $ 6,101 49 The following table summarizes consolidated operating income: Year ended 2011(1) 2010 2009 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 1,225 $ 1,039 $ 994 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives loss (54 ) (6 ) (12 ) Total segment operating income 1,171 1,034 982 Reconciling items: Stock based compensation (49 ) (46 ) (44 ) Equity investment income 9 9 2 Consolidated operating income 1,131 997 940 Reconciliation of non GAAP measure: Add: Goodwill impairment charge 24 Non GAAP consolidated operating income $ 1,155 $ 997 $ 940 (1) For the year ended December 31, 2011 we have excluded a non cash goodwill impairment charge from operating expenses and operating income because management believes that this presentation enhances a users understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding a non cash goodwill impairment charge that resulted from a decrease in the implied fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount associated with HomeChoice Partners (HCP), which provides infusion therapy services, during the second quarter of 2011 and is therefore more meaningful and comparable to our prior period results and more indicative of our normal consolidated operating income. Consolidated net operating revenues Consolidated net operating revenues for 2011 increased by approximately $544 million or approximately 8.5% from 2010. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $422 million, principally due to strong volume growth from additional treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions including the acquisition of DSI, partially offset by a decline of $7 in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, primarily from a decrease in our Medicare revenues as a result of operating in the new single bundled payment system, as described above. Consolidated net operating revenues also increased as a result of an increase of approximately $130 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services and from our disease management services. Consolidated net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $337 million or approximately 5.5% from 2009. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $279 million, principally due to an increase in the number of treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decline of $3 in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, as described above, and an increase of approximately $50 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services and from our infusion therapy services. Consolidated operating income Consolidated operating income of $1,131 million for 2011 increased by approximately $134 million, or 13.4%, from 2010 which includes the $24 million HCP goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this item, consolidated operating income would have increased by $158 million, or 15.8%, primarily due to an increase in the dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues as a result of strong volume growth in revenue from additional treatments as a result of non acquired growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decline in our 50 average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $7, as described below. Consolidated operating income also increased as a result of overall lower pharmaceutical costs mainly from a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, additional operating income from the acquisition of DSI and from cost control initiatives. However, consolidated operating income was negatively impacted by higher labor and benefit costs, an increase in our professional fees for compliance and legal initiatives, and for information technology matters, transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of DSI, an increase in EPO pharmaceutical costs and an increase in expenses associated with our international expansion. Consolidated operating income of $997 million for 2010 increased by approximately $57 million, or 6.1%, from 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue as a result of additional treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions in dialysis and related lab services, partially offset by a decline in our average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3, as described below. Operating income also increased as a result of continued cost control initiatives, improved productivity, overall lower pharmaceutical costs and lower operating losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, partially offset by the negative impact on our operating margin from a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, higher labor costs and increases in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Operating segments Dialysis and Related Lab Services Year ended 2011 2010 2009 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, exceptper treatment data) Revenues $ 6,485 $ 6,063 $ 5,784 Segment operating income $ 1,225 $ 1,039 $ 994 Dialysis treatments 19,599,472 17,963,862 16,984,959 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 62,618 57,392 54,352 Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment $ 330 $ 337 $ 340 Net operating revenues Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2011 increased by approximately $422 million or approximately 7.0% from 2010. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to strong volume growth from additional treatments of approximately 9.1% due to an increase in non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions, which includes additional treatments associated with the acquisition of DSI. However, this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $7, or 2.1%. The decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2011, as compared to 2010, was primarily due to a decline in our Medicare reimbursements as a result of operating in the new single bundled payment system, continued decline in the commercial payor mix and a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $279 million or approximately 4.8% from 2009. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 5.8% due to an increase in non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. However, this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3, or 0.9%. The decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2010, as compared to 2009, was primarily due to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals and a decline in the commercial payor mix, partially offset by a 1% increase in the Medicare composite rate and an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. 51 The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues by modality for the year ended December 31, 2011: Revenuepercentages Outpatient hemodialysis centers 81 % Peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis 14 % Hospital inpatient hemodialysis 5 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Approximately 66% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 were from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare assigned plans, representing approximately 89% of our total patients. Over the last several years, we have been experiencing growth in our government based patients that has been outpacing the growth in our commercial patients which has negatively impacted our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment. Our overall percentage of patients and revenues associated with commercial payors continued to decline in 2011. Less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are due directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 6% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. On average we are paid significantly more for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans in the United States than we are for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other government plans such as Medicare assigned plans. Patients covered by commercial health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Nearly all of our net earnings from our dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at established contract rates and others which pay negotiated payment rates based on our usual and customary fee schedule for our out of network patients. If we experience a net overall reduction in our contracted and non contracted commercial rates as a result of these negotiations or restrictions, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors, including our commercial payment rates, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals under the new Medicare bundled payment rate system, including our ability to capture all patient characteristics, changes in the mix of government and commercial patients, and changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are billed separately. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and operating costs of the dialysis centers. The dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $217 and $232 for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The $15 decrease in the per treatment costs in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, continued cost control initiatives, partially offset by higher labor and benefit costs, and higher EPO costs. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $232 and $235 for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The $3 decrease in the per treatment costs in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, a decrease in our overall pharmaceutical costs and continued improvements in productivity, partially offset by higher labor rates. 52 General and administrative expenses. Dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses for the years ended 2011, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $551 million, $471 million and $428 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $80 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to increases in labor and benefit costs, an increase in our professional expenses for legal and compliance initiatives and for information technology matters as well as transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of DSI. The increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $43 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to increases in labor and benefit costs, partially offset by the timing of certain other expenditures. Depreciation and amortization. Dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $260 million, $227 million and $221 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $33 million in depreciation and amortization for dialysis and related lab services in 2011 and $6 million in 2010 were primarily due to growth through new center developments and acquisitions. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for dialysis and related lab services was 2.9% for 2011, 2.7% for 2010, and 2.7% for 2009. The increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts during 2011 was primarily the result of a slowdown in our historical collection experience from some of our non government payors. The current provision level of 3.0% at the end of 2011 may increase if we encounter problems with our billing and collection process as a result of sustained weakness in the U.S. economy. Segment operating income Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2011 increased by approximately $186 million as compared to 2010. The increase in the operating income for 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to strong treatment growth as a result of additional dialysis treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $7 as described above. The dialysis and related lab services operating income also increased as a result of a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, and additional operating income from the acquisition of DSI. However, the dialysis and related lab services operating income was negatively impacted by higher labor and benefit costs, an increase in the cost of EPO, an increase in our professional fees in conjunction with compliance and legal initiatives and for information technology matters as well as transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of DSI. Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2010 increased by approximately $45 million as compared to 2009. The increase in the operating income for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to growth in the number of dialysis treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3 as described above. The dialysis and related lab services operating income also increased as a result of certain cost control initiatives, improved productivity, and overall lower pharmaceutical costs. However, the dialysis and related lab services operating income was negatively impacted by an operating margin decrease due to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, higher labor costs and an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Other Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Year ended 2011 2010 2009 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Revenues $ 514 $ 384 $ 334 Segment operating loss $ (54 ) $ (6 ) $ (12 ) 53 Net operating revenues The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2011 increased by approximately $130 million or 33.9% as compared to 2010, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, and from our disease management services. The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $50 million or 15.0% as compared to 2009, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, and from our infusion therapy services, partially offset by a decline in our net operating revenues in our disease management services as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. Operating expenses Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2011 increased by approximately $179 million from 2010, which includes the $24 million HCP goodwill impairment charged as described below. Excluding this item, ancillary services and strategic initiatives adjusted operating expenses would have increased by $155 million. This increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business, an increase in expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion and an increase in labor and benefit costs. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2010 increased by approximately $43 million from 2009, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business and an increase in labor costs, partially offset by lower operating costs of our disease management services as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. Goodwill In the second quarter of 2011, we determined that circumstances indicated it was more likely than not that the fair value of one of our ancillary businesses, HCP, which provides infusion therapy services, was less than its carrying amount. The primary factor informing our conclusion was the recent decline in the operating performance of HCP caused mainly by rapid expansion. This led management to revise its view of HCPs organizational growth capability and scale back significantly its current plans for HCPs future growth initiatives and to update HCPs forecasts and current operating budgets accordingly. These revisions reflected the current and expected future cash flows that we believed market participants would use in determining the fair value or the HCP business. As a result, in the second quarter of 2011, we estimated that the carrying amount of goodwill related to HCP exceeded its implied fair value by $24 million, resulting in a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of that amount. As of December 31, 2011, after giving effect to this impairment charge, we have approximately $32 million of HCP goodwill remaining. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we finalized our calculation of this impairment charge, which did not change the goodwill impairment charge previously recorded. Segment operating loss Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2011 increased by approximately $48 million from 2010, which includes the $24 million HCP goodwill impairment charge, as described above. Excluding this item, ancillary services and strategic initiatives adjusted operating losses would have increased by $24 million. This increase in operating losses was primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion and a deterioration in the operating performance of our infusion therapy services, partially offset by an increase in the operating performance of our pharmacy business, and in our vascular access services. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2010 decreased by approximately $6 million from 2009. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to volume growth in revenues associated with our pharmacy business, and a decrease in operating losses in our disease management business as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. 54 Corporate level charges Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation of approximately $49 million for 2011 increased by approximately $3 million from 2010. Stock based compensation of approximately $46 million for 2010 increased by approximately $2 million from 2009. The increase in 2011 resulted from an increase in the overall grant date fair value for the grant years that contributed expense to 2011, driven by both an increase in the grant date fair value of 2011 grants over that for recent years and an increase in the number of awards granted in 2011 over 2010. The increase in 2010 resulted principally from an increase in the overall grant date fair value for the grant years that contributed expense to 2010, driven in part by a substantial increase in the grant date fair value of 2010 grants over that for recent years offset by a significant reduction in the number of awards granted in 2010. Debt expense. Debt expense for 2011, 2010, and 2009 consisted of interest expense of approximately $231 million, $172 million, and $176 million, respectively, including the amortization and accretion of debt discounts and premiums and the amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $10 million in 2011, $9 million in 2010 and $10 million in 2009. The increase in interest expense in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily related to additional borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities that were issued in the fourth quarter of 2010 and additional borrowings associated with the new Term Loan A 2 that contain significantly higher interest rates than our previous facility. In addition, debt expense in 2011 was also impacted by the amount of interest rate swaps that resulted in a higher overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Term Loan A and from the amortization of an interest rate cap premium associated with our Term Loan B. However, debt expense in 2011 benefited from lower rates and lower outstanding balances associated with our new senior notes that were issued in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2011 was 5.28% as compared to 4.68% in 2010. The decrease in interest expense in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily related to lower average outstanding principal balances on our previously outstanding Term Loan A, lower average outstanding principal balances on our previously outstanding senior notes, lower interest rates associated with the issuance of our New Senior Notes and a decrease in our weighted average effective interest rate on the Term Loan B as a result of lower notional amounts of fixed rate swap agreements that contained higher rates. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2010 was 4.68% as compared to 4.86% in 2009. However, interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2010 was negatively affected by the refinancing of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities that occurred on October 20, 2010, as the interest rates under our new Senior Secured Credit Facilities are substantially higher than the interest rates under the previous facility. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in the fourth quarter of 2010 was 4.86%. Equity investment income. Equity investment income was approximately $9.0 million in 2011 as compared to $9.0 million in 2010 and $2.4 million in 2009. Equity investment income in 2011 as compared to 2010 was flat but was impacted by an increase in the profitability of certain of our nonconsolidated joint ventures, offset by a decrease in the operating performance of certain other joint ventures. The increase in equity investment income in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the profitability of our nonconsolidated joint ventures. Other income. Other income was approximately $3 million, $3 million, and $4 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, and consisted principally of interest income. Other income in 2011 was slightly down from 2010, primarily as a result of lower average interest rates and lower average cash balances. The decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily the result of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash balances. Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for 2011 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 35.4%, compared with 35.0% and 36.7% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2011 was higher primarily due to non deductible transaction costs associated with the DSI acquisition. 55 Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, and our investments in ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that an impairment review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. These types of adjustments are charged directly to the corresponding operating segment that incurred the charge. Except for the HCP goodwill charge in 2011, there were no other significant impairments or valuation adjustments recognized during the periods presented. Noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $95 million, $79 million and $57 million, respectively. The increases in noncontrolling interests in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to increases in the number of new joint ventures and increases in the profitability of our dialysis related joint ventures. The percentage of dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues generated from dialysis related joint ventures was approximately 18% in both 2011 and 2010. Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2011 and 2010 represented approximately 61 days of revenue for both periods, net of bad debt allowance. Our days outstanding in 2011, represent solid improved cash collections that enabled us to keep pace with our growth in revenue. However, our cash collections in early 2012 could be negatively impacted as Medicare upgrades its systems to meet their new billing requirements. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, approximately $188 million and $153 million in unreserved accounts receivable, respectively, representing approximately 16% and 15% of our total accounts receivable balance, respectively, were more than six months old. During 2011, we experienced improved cash collections from certain government payors and certain commercial payors. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than 1% of our revenues are classified as patient pay. Substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $57 million in 2011 and $46 million in 2010, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Currently, a significant portion of our Medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. However, the payment received from Medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. Such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements, except for potentially limiting the collectability of these Medicare bad debt claims. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2011, our cash balance was $394 million and we had undrawn credit under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $350 million, of which approximately $52 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2011 amounted to $1,180 million, compared with $840 million for 2010. The increase in our operating cash flows in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to improved cash earnings, a reduction in income tax payments and the timing of other working capital items, partially offset by an 56 increase in our accounts receivable balances from growth in revenue. Cash flow from operations in 2011 included cash interest payments of approximately $236 million and cash tax payments of $146 million. Cash flow from operations in 2010 included cash interest payments of approximately $191 million and cash tax payments of $207 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2011 included $436 million for capital asset expenditures, including $176 million for new center developments and relocations, and $260 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $1,077 million for acquisitions. During 2011, we also received $49 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, the majority of these proceeds was either used to repurchase other investments or was used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, during 2011, we received $32 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $101 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $21 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 3.8 million shares of our common stock for approximately $323 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2010 included $279 million for capital asset expenditures, including $120 million for new center developments and relocations, and $159 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $189 million for acquisitions. During 2010, we also received $61 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, during 2010, we received $60 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $84 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $10 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 8.9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $619 million. During 2011, we acquired a total of 178 dialysis centers, eight of which were located outside of the United States, opened 65 new dialysis centers, sold two centers, merged seven centers, and divested a total of 30 dialysis centers in connection with the acquisition of DSI. We also added three dialysis centers under management and administrative service agreements that are located outside of the United States and added one center in which we own a minority equity interest. During 2010, we acquired a total of 41 dialysis centers, opened 65 new dialysis centers, sold six centers, closed 18 centers, and made minority equity investments in three centers that were previously under management and administrative service agreements. Acquisition On September 2, 2011, we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of CDSI I Holding Company, Inc., the parent company of dialysis provider DSI Renal Inc. (DSI), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger for approximately $723 million in net cash, plus the assumption of certain liabilities totaling approximately $6.5 million, subject to certain post closing adjustments. DSI had 113 outpatient dialysis centers that provided services to approximately 8,000 patients in 23 states. We also incurred approximately $22 million in transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2011 associated with this acquisition that are included in general and administrative expenses. Pursuant to a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission on September 2, 2011, we agreed to divest a total of 30 outpatient dialysis centers and several home based dialysis programs in order to complete the acquisition of DSI. In conjunction with the consent order, on September 30, 2011, we completed the sale of 28 outpatient dialysis centers to Dialysis Newco, Inc., or Dialysis Newco, a portfolio company of Frazier Healthcare VI, L.P. and New Enterprise Associates 13, Limited Partnership pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated August 26, 2011. Effective October 31, 2011, we also completed the sale of two additional outpatient dialysis centers to Dialysis Newco that were previously pending state regulatory approval. We anticipate receiving total net cash consideration of approximately $82.0 million for all of the outpatient dialysis centers that were divested. 57 2011 capital structure changes and other items On August 26, 2011, we entered into an Increase Joinder Agreement under our existing Senior Secured Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Increase Joinder Agreement, we increased the revolving credit facility by $100 million, to a total of $350 million, and entered into an additional $200 million Term Loan A 2. The new Term Loan A 2 required a principal payment of $0.5 million on December 31, 2011 and thereafter requires annual principal payments of $2.0 million with the balance of $191.5 million due in 2016, and bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.00%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.50% subject to a rating based step down to 3.25%. During the year ended December 31, 2011 we made mandatory principal payments under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $50 million on the Term Loan A, $0.5 million on Term Loan A 2 and $17.5 million on the Term Loan B. Interest rate swaps and caps In January 2011, we entered into nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1.0 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011, as a means of hedging our exposure to and volatility from variable based interest rate changes as part of our overall risk management strategy. As of December 31, 2011, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $950 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan A to fixed rates ranging from 1.59% to 1.64%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 4.11%, including the Term Loan A margin of 2.50%. The swap agreements expire by September 30, 2014 and require monthly interest payments. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we accrued net charges of $12.6 million from these swaps which are included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2011, the total fair value of these swap agreements was a liability of $23.1 million. We estimate that approximately $10.9 million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2011 will be reclassified into income over the next year. In addition, in January 2011, we also entered into five interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling $1.25 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 4.00% on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan B debt. The cap agreements expire on September 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2011, the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of $1.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded $5.2 million, net of tax, as a decrease to other comprehensive income due to unrealized valuation changes in the cap agreements, net of the amortization of the interest rate cap premiums that were reclassified into net income. As a result of the swap and cap agreements, our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 4.61%, based upon the current margins in effect of 2.50% for the Term Loan A, 3.50% for the Term Loan A 2 and 3.00% for the Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, interest rates on our Term Loan A 2 and Term Loan B are set at their LIBOR floors plus their interest rate margins. Interest rates on our senior notes and Term Loan A are fixed and economically fixed, respectively, with rates on the $1.25 billion of our Term Loan B subject to interest rate caps. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2011 was 5.28% and as of December 31, 2011 was 5.27%. Stock repurchases During 2011, we repurchased a total of 3,794,686 shares of our common stock for $323.3 million, or an average price of $85.21 per share, pursuant to a previously announced authorization by the Board of Directors on 58 November 3, 2010, that authorized an additional $800 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions, the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2011 was $358.2 million. We have not repurchased any additional shares of our common stock from January 1, 2012 through February 24, 2012. This stock repurchase program has no expiration date. Stock based compensation Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the straight line amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in all prior periods. During 2011, we granted 2,707,500 stock settled stock appreciation rights with a grant date fair value of $59.4 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 4.2 years, and also granted 150,246 stock units with a grant date fair value of $12.8 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 3.1 years. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recognized $48.7 million and $45.6 million, respectively, in stock based compensation expense for stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock options, stock units and discounted employee stock plan purchases, which is primarily included in general and administrative expenses. The estimated tax benefits recorded for this stock based compensation in 2011 and 2010 were $18.4 million and $17.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, there was $91.3 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock settled compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we received $5.4 million and $48.7 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $38.2 million and $26.7 million, respectively, in total actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. Other items On July 22, 2010, we entered into a First National Service Provider Agreement, or the Agreement, with NxStage Medical Inc., or NxStage. Under the terms of the Agreement we have the ability to continue to purchase NxStage System One hemodialysis machines and related supplies at discount prices. In addition, we may, in lieu of cash rebate, vest in warrants to purchase NxStage common stock based upon achieving certain System One home patient growth targets by June 30, 2011, 2012 and 2013. The warrants are exercisable for up to a cumulative total of 5.5 million shares of common stock over the three years at an initial exercise price of $14.22 per share. From the period July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011, we earned warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of NxStage common stock. In October 2011 we exercised our right to purchase 250,000 shares of NxStage common stock at $14.22 per share, for a total of approximately $3.6 million and in February 2012, we sold all 250,000 shares for approximately $5.2 million. In July 2010, we announced that we will construct a new corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado. In July 2010, we acquired the land and existing improvements for approximately $12 million. Effective December 18, 2010, we entered into a construction agreement for the construction of the new building. We currently estimate the total construction costs and other project costs of the building will be approximately $95 million. Construction began in early 2011, and is still estimated to be complete in the second half of 2012. Through December 31, 2011, we have paid construction costs and architecture and other design fees totaling approximately $49 million. 2010 capital structure changes On October 20, 2010, we entered into a $3,000 million Senior Secured Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), consisting of a five year $250 million revolving line of credit, a five year $1,000 million Term Loan 59 A and a six year $1,750 million Term Loan B. We also have the right to request an increase to the borrowing capacity to a total aggregate principal amount of not more than $4,000 million subject to bank participation. The revolving line of credit and the Term Loan A initially bore interest at LIBOR plus an interest rate margin of 2.75% until June 30, 2011, when the interest rate margin was reduced to 2.50%. The interest rate margin is still subject to adjustment depending upon our leverage ratio and can range from 2.25% to 2.75%. The Term Loan A requires annual principal payments of $50 million in 2011, $50 million in 2012, $100 million in 2013, and $150 million in 2014, with the balance of $650 million due in 2015. The Term Loan B bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.50%) plus 3.00% subject to a ratings based step down to 2.75%. The Term Loan B requires annual principal payments of $17.5 million in each year from 2011 through 2015 with the balance of $1,663 million due in 2016. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of DaVitas and its guarantors assets. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants such as various restrictions on investments, acquisitions, the payment of dividends, redemptions and acquisitions of capital stock, capital expenditures and other indebtedness, as well as limitations on the amount of tangible net assets in non guarantor subsidiaries. However, many of these restrictions will not apply as long as our leverage ratio is below 3.50:1.00. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires compliance with financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio and a leverage ratio that determines the interest rate margins as described above. On October 20, 2010, we also issued $775 million aggregate principal amount of 6  3/8% senior notes due 2018 and $775 million aggregate principal amount of 6  5/8% senior notes due 2020 (the New Senior Notes). The New Senior Notes will pay interest on May 1 and November 1, of each year beginning May 1, 2011. The New Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally to other unsecured senior indebtedness. The New Senior Notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. We may redeem some or all of the 6  3/8% senior notes at any time on or after November 1, 2013 at certain redemption prices and may redeem some or all of the 6 5/8% senior notes at any time on or after November 1, 2014 at certain redemption prices. We received total proceeds of $4,300 million from these transactions, $2,750 million from the borrowings on Term Loan A and Term Loan B and an additional $1,550 million from the issuance of the New Senior Notes. We used a portion of the proceeds to pay off the outstanding principal balances of our existing senior secured credit facilities plus accrued interest totaling $1,795 million and to purchase pursuant to a cash tender offer $558 million of the outstanding principal balances of our $700 million 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $731 million of the outstanding balances of our $850 million 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015 (the Existing Notes), plus accrued interest totaling $1,297 million. The total amount paid for the Existing Notes was $1,019.06 per $1,000 principal amount of the 6  5/8% senior notes and $1,038.75 per $1,000 principal amount of the 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes. This resulted in us paying a cash tender premium of $39 million in order to extinguish this portion of the Existing Notes. On November 19, 2010, we redeemed the remaining outstanding balance of the existing 6  5/8% senior notes of $142 million at 101.656% per $1,000 and the remaining outstanding balance of the existing 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes of $119 million at 103.625% per $1,000 plus accrued interest totaling $265 million. In addition, we paid a call premium totaling $7 million. We also paid an additional $74 million in fees, discounts and other expenses. As a result of the above transactions, we received approximately $823 million in excess cash which we have been using for general purposes and other opportunities, including share repurchases, acquisitions and other growth investments. In connection with these transactions, we expensed debt refinancing and redemption charges totaling $70.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, which includes the write off of certain existing deferred financing costs and other new financing costs, the cash tender and call premiums, as described above and other expenses. On June 7, 2010, we redeemed $200 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6  5/8% senior notes due 2013, at a price of 101.656% plus accrued interest. As a result of this transaction, we expensed debt redemption charges of $4.1 million, which includes the call premium and the net write off of other finance costs. 60 Senior Secured Credit Facilities and senior and senior subordinated notes During 2010, we made mandatory principal payments totaling $65.6 million on our prior outstanding Term Loan A. We did not make any principal payments on Term Loan B during 2010, nor were we required to. All of the outstanding balances under the prior Term Loan A, Term Loan B and the senior and senior subordinated notes were extinguished as part of our debt refinancing transactions that occurred on October 20, 2010, as described above. Stock repurchases During 2010, we repurchased a total of 8,918,760 shares of our common stock for $618.5 million, or an average price of $69.35 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. Interest rate swaps Our previous interest rate swap agreements expired on September 30, 2010. The agreements that were effective during 2010 had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 4.05% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.84% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the Term Loan B margin of 1.50%. During 2010 and 2009, we accrued net cash obligations of approximately $9.1 million and $17.3 million, respectively, from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 4.05%, based upon the current margins in effect of 2.75% for the Term Loan A and 3.00% for the Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, interest rates on our Term Loan B are set at its LIBOR floors plus its interest rate margin and interest rates on our senior notes are fixed. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2010 was 4.68% and as of December 31, 2010 was 4.94%. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases and letters of credit as well as potential obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated businesses and to dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several joint ventures and for some of our non wholly owned subsidiaries in the form of put provisions. If these put provisions were exercised, we would be required to purchase the third party owners noncontrolling interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the noncontrolling interests put to us, which is intended to approximate fair value. For additional information see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several other dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties or centers in which we own an equity investment, as well as to physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under management and administrative services agreements. 61 The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011 (in millions): Less Than1 year 2 3years 4 5years After5 years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 85 $ 297 $ 2,531 $ 1,557 $ 4,470 Interest payments on the senior notes 100 202 202 279 783 Interest payments on the Term Loan B(1) 79 155 137 371 Interest payments on the Term Loan A 2(2) 9 18 16 43 Capital lease obligations 2 5 4 32 43 Operating leases 258 444 370 636 1,708 Construction of the new corporate headquarters 46 46 $ 579 $ 1,121 $ 3,260 $ 2,504 $ 7,464 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 52 $ $ $ $ 52 Noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions 260 98 76 44 478 Pay fixed swaps potential obligations 11 12 23 Operating capital advances 4 4 $ 327 $ 110 $ 76 $ 44 $ 557 (1) Assuming no changes to LIBOR based interest rates as the Term Loan B currently bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.50%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.00%. (2) Assuming no changes to LIBOR based interest rates as the Term Loan A 2 currently bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.00%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.50% The pay fixed swap obligations represent the estimated fair market values of our interest rate swap agreements as reported by various broker dealers that are based upon relevant observable market inputs as well as other current market conditions that existed as of December 31, 2011, and represent the estimated potential obligation that we would be required to pay based upon the estimated future settlement of each specific tranche over the term of the swap agreements, assuming no future changes in the forward yield curve. The actual amount of our obligation associated with these swaps in the future will depend upon changes in the LIBOR based interest rates that can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions, and other relevant factors that can affect the fair market value of these swap agreements. In addition to the above commitments, we are obligated to purchase a certain amount of our hemodialysis products and supplies at fixed prices through 2015 from Gambro Renal Products, Inc. in connection with the Product Supply Agreement. Our total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs in each year. In January 2010, we entered into an agreement with Fresenius which committed us to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies from them through 2013. Our total expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2011 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs. The actual amount of purchases in future years from Gambro Renal Products and Fresenius will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, and in the case of the Product Supply Agreement, Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. In November 2011, we entered into a seven year Sourcing and Supply Agreement with Amgen USA Inc. that expires on December 31, 2018. Under the terms of the agreement we will purchase EPO in amounts 62 necessary to meet no less than 90% of our requirements for erythropoiesis stimulating agents. The actual amount of EPO that we will purchase from Amgen will depend upon the amount of EPO administered during dialysis as prescribed by physicians and the overall number of patients that we serve. Settlements of approximately $12 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made. Contingencies The information in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements of this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, contingencies and temporary equity. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly and annual variable compensation accruals, purchase accounting valuation estimates, fair value estimates and stock based compensation are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Effective January 1, 2011, our reimbursements from Medicare became subject to certain variations under Medicares new single bundled payment rate system whereby our reimbursements can be adjusted for certain patient characteristics and certain other factors. Our revenue recognition depends upon our ability to effectively capture, document and bill for Medicares base payment rate and these other factors. In addition, as a result of the potential range of variations that can occur in our reimbursements from Medicare under the new single bundled payment rate system, our revenue recognition is now subject to a greater degree of estimating risk. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans 63 with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, slow down in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 142,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as 6% of consolidated operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairments of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers or other operations. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year, and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. We are required to assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and to also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain and future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. 64 Purchase accounting valuation estimates. We make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and contractual as well as non contractual contingencies associated with our acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Fair value estimates. We have recorded certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests (temporary equity) subject to put provisions at fair value. The FASB defines fair value which is measured based upon certain valuation techniques that include inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. We have measured the fair values of our applicable assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions based upon certain market inputs and assumptions that are either observable or unobservable in determining fair values and have also classified these assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels. The fair value of our investments available for sale are based upon quoted market prices from active markets and the fair value of our swap and cap agreements were based upon valuation models utilizing the income approach and commonly accepted valuation techniques that use inputs from closing prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as well as other relevant observable market inputs at quoted intervals such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, implied volatility and credit default swap pricing. For our noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions we have estimated the fair values of these based upon either the higher of a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. During the second quarter of 2010, we refined the methodology used to estimate the fair value of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions by eliminating an annual inflation factor that was previously applied to the put provisions until they became exercisable. We believe that eliminating an annual inflation factor will result in a better representation of the estimated actual fair value of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. The estimate of the fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners noncontrolling interests. Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the straight line amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk free interest rates. Significant new accounting standards On January 1, 2012, we adopted FASBs Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. This standard amends the current two step goodwill impairment test required under the existing accounting guidance. This amendment allows entities the option to first assess certain qualitative factors to ascertain whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount to determine if the two step impairment test is necessary. If an entity concludes that certain events or circumstances prove that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then an entity is required to proceed to step one of the two step goodwill impairment test. This standard is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 65 On January 1, 2012, we adopted FASBs ASU No. 2011 07, Health Care Entities Presentation and Disclosure of Patient Service Revenue, Provision for Bad Debts, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This standard amends the current presentation and disclosure requirements for Health Care Entities that recognize significant amounts of patient service revenue at the time the services are rendered without assessing the patients ability to pay. This standard requires health care entities to reclassify the provision for bad debts from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenues. In addition, this standard requires more disclosure on the policies for recognizing revenue, assessing bad debts, as well as quantitative and qualitative information regarding changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts. This standard is applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented and is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard will require us to change the presentation in our financial statements. On January 1, 2012, we adopted FASBs ASU No. 2011 05, Comprehensive Income Presentation of Comprehensive Income. This standard amends the current presentation requirements for comprehensive income by eliminating the presentation of the components of other comprehensive income within the statement of equity. This standard allows two options on how to present the various components of comprehensive income. These options are either to report the components of comprehensive income separately on the income statement or to present total other comprehensive income and the components of other comprehensive income in a separate statement. This standard does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item must be reclassified into net income. This standard is applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard will require us to change the presentation in our financial statements. On January 1, 2012, we adopted FASBs ASU No. 2011 04, Fair Value Measurement. This standard amends the current fair value measurement and disclosure requirements to improve comparability between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The intent of this standard is to update the disclosures that describe several of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and to enhance disclosures about fair value measurements which will improve consistency between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. This standard does not change the application of the requirements on fair value measurements and disclosures. This standard is applied prospectively and is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2011. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average LIBOR rates in effect for all debt tranches plus interest rate margins in effect at December 31, 2011. The Term Loan A margin currently in effect is 2.50% and along with the revolving line of credit is subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio. The Term Loan A 2 currently bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.00%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.50% subject to a ratings based step down to 3.25%. The Term Loan B currently bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.50%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.00% subject to a ratings based step down to 2.75%. Expected maturity date Total FairValue Averageinterestrate 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 35 $ 24 $ 24 $ 24 $ 1,858 $ 1,585 $ 3,550 $ 3,543 5.59 % Variable rate $ 52 $ 101 $ 153 $ 652 $ 1 $ 4 $ 963 $ 951 2.81 % 66 Notionalamount Contract maturity date Pay fixed Receive variable Fairvalue 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 (dollars in millions) Swaps: Pay fixed rate $ 950 $ 50 $ 100 $ 800 $ $ 1.59% to 1.64% LIBOR $ (23.1 ) Cap agreements $ 1,250 $ $ $ 1,250 $ $ LIBOR above 4.00% $ 1.4 Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which include the Term Loan A, the Term Loan A 2 and the Term Loan B, consist of various individual tranches of debt that can range in maturity from one month to twelve months (currently, all tranches are one month in duration). For the Term Loan A, each tranche bears interest at a LIBOR rate that is determined by the duration of such tranche plus an interest rate margin. The LIBOR variable component of the interest rate for each tranche is reset as such tranche matures and a new tranche is established. LIBOR can fluctuate significantly depending upon conditions in the credit and capital markets. The Term Loan A 2 and Term Loan B are subject to LIBOR floors of 1.00% and 1.50%, respectively. Because LIBOR, as of December 31, 2011, was lower than either of these floors, the interest rates on the Term Loan A 2 and the Term Loan B are treated as fixed for purposes of the table above. We have included both of these Term Loans in the fixed rate totals in the table above until such time as the LIBOR based component of our interest rate exceeds 1.00% on the Term Loan A 2 and 1.50% on the Term Loan B. At such time, we will then be subject to LIBOR based interest rate volatility on the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on all of the Term Loan A 2, as well as for the Term Loan B, but limited to a maximum rate of 4.00% on $1.25 billion of outstanding principal debt on the Term Loan B. The remaining $483 million outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan B is subject to LIBOR based interest rate volatility above a floor of 1.50%. In January 2011, we entered into nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1.0 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011, as a means of hedging our exposure to and volatility from variable based interest rate changes as part of our overall risk management strategy. As of December 31, 2011, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $950 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan A to fixed rates ranging from 1.59% to 1.64%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 4.11%, including the Term Loan A margin of 2.50%. The swap agreements expire by September 30, 2014 and require monthly interest payments. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we accrued net charges of $12.6 million from these swaps which are included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2011, the total fair value of these swap agreements was a liability of $23.1 million. We estimate that approximately $10.9 million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2011 will be reclassified into income over the next year. In addition, in January 2011, we also entered into five interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling $1.25 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 4.00% on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan B debt. The cap agreements expire on September 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2011, the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of $1.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded $5.2 million, net of tax, as a decrease to other comprehensive income due to unrealized valuation changes in the cap agreements, net of the amortization of the interest rate cap premiums that were reclassified into net income. As a result of the swap and cap agreements, our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 4.61%, based upon the current margins in effect of 2.50% for the Term Loan A, 3.50% for the Term Loan A 2 and 3.00% for the Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2011. 67 As of December 31, 2011, interest rates on our Term Loan A 2 and Term Loan B are set at their LIBOR floors plus their interest rate margins. Interest rates on our senior notes and Term Loan A are fixed and economically fixed, respectively, with rates on the $1.25 billion of our Term Loan B subject to interest rate caps. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2011 was 5.28% and as of December 31, 2011 was 5.27%. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $0.6 million, $11.1 million, and $8.5 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Exchange rate sensitivity We are currently not exposed to any significant foreign currency exchange rate risk.

We base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Item 1. Business. Overview We are a leading provider of kidney dialysis services, primarily in the United States, through a network of approximately 1,809 outpatient dialysis centers and approximately 900 hospitals, located in the United States throughout 43 states and District of Columbia, serving a total of approximately 142,000 patients. We estimate that we have approximately a 32% market share in the United States based upon the number of patients that we serve. In 2011, our overall network of dialysis centers increased by 208 centers primarily as a result of acquisitions and from opening new centers. In September 2011 we acquired DSI, a medium sized dialysis provider, for approximately $723 million in net cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. DSI contributed a net 83 dialysis centers, after which we agreed to divest a total of 30 dialysis centers in order to complete the acquisition of DSI. In addition, the overall number of patients that we serve in the U.S. increased by approximately 13.0% as compared to 2010. In addition, as of December 31, 2011, we provided dialysis and administrative services to a total of 11 outpatient dialysis centers located in three countries outside of the United States. Our international dialysis operations are currently in a start up phase in which we primarily commenced operations during the fourth quarter of 2011. The total net operating revenues generated from our international operations were not material 43 during 2011 and are included as a component of our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. Therefore, all references in this document to dialysis and related lab services continue to refer only to our U.S. dialysis and related lab services business for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our national scale and size, among other things, allows us to provide industry leading quality care with superior clinical outcomes that attracts patients and referring physicians, as well as qualified medical directors, provides our patient base with convenient locations and access to a full range of services and provides us the ability to effectively control certain costs while maintaining strong compliance programs. Our stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. We believe our attention to these three stakeholders our patients, our business partners, and our teammates represents the major driver of our long term performance, although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns. Accordingly, two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita Quality Index, or DQI. Our clinical outcomes as measured by DQI have improved over each of the past three years which we believe directly decreases patient mortalities. Although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the United States and generally exceed the dialysis outcome quality indicators of the National Kidney Foundation. In addition, over the past several years our teammate turnover has remained relatively constant, which we believe was a major contributor to our continued clinical performance improvements and also a major driver of our ability to maintain or improve clinical hours per treatment. We will continue to focus on these stakeholders and our clinical outcomes as we believe these are fundamental long term value drivers. Our overall financial performance was strong for 2011 and was characterized by strong treatment volume growth, primarily from acquisitions and non acquired growth rates and by decreased operating costs from a decline in the utilization of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals due to continued evolution of clinical practices and physicians responding to the new FDA label for EPO. Our major financial operating performance indicators in 2011 as compared to 2010 were as follows: consolidated revenue growth of approximately 8.5%; an increase of approximately 9.1% in the overall number of treatments that we provided; normalized non acquired treatment growth of 4.6%; consolidated operating income growth of approximately 13.4%, which includes the impact of a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 2.4%; effective operating cost control initiatives; and strong operating cash flows of $1,180 million. However, we believe that 2012 will continue to be challenging as we implement some additional Medicare billing requirements and as we implement system and process upgrades to enhance our ability to capture certain patient characteristics that can impact our overall reimbursements from Medicare. In addition, there remains significant scrutiny and uncertainty around the utilization of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, which along with pharmaceutical cost increases and changes in certain government policies, can have a significant impact on our operating results. We are also committed to our international expansion plans that will continue to require a significant investment in 2012. In addition, if the percentage of our patients with commercial payors continues to deteriorate this would also impact our operating results. Approximately 93% of our 2011 consolidated net operating revenues were derived directly from our dialysis and related lab services business. Approximately 81% of our 2011 dialysis and related lab services revenues were derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in the 1,776 U.S. centers that we consolidate. Other dialysis 44 services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home based hemodialysis, hospital inpatient hemodialysis services and management and administrative services. These services collectively accounted for the balance of our 2011 dialysis and related lab services revenues. Our other business operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. These consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs, physician services and our international dialysis operations. These services generated approximately $514 million of net operating revenues in 2011, representing approximately 7% of our consolidated net operating revenues. We currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives including our continued expansion into certain international markets as we work to develop successful new business operations in the United States as well as outside the United States. However, any significant change in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives. Any unfavorable changes in these strategic initiatives could result in a write off or an impairment of some or all of our investments, including goodwill, which occurred in 2011 when we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge relating to our infusion therapy business, and could also result in significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are: the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week, as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services; and average dialysis revenue per treatment. The total patient base is a relatively stable factor, which we believe is influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, our relationships with referring physicians, together with the quality of our clinical care which can lead to reduced patient mortalities, and our ability to open and acquire new dialysis centers. In 2011, we were able to increase our overall network of patients that we serviced in the U.S. by approximately 13% as compared to 2010. Our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in 2011 was primarily driven by our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, commercial and government payment rates, our billing and collecting operations performance, and the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are separately billable. Beginning in 2011, with the implementation of Medicares new single bundled payment rate system, the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals had a lesser impact on our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment since payment for these pharmaceuticals is included in a single bundled payment. In addition, some of our commercial contracts covering certain patients also pay us under a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided. On average, payment rates from commercial payors are significantly higher than Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis revenue per treatment. The percentage of commercial patients covered under contracted plans as compared to commercial patients with out of network providers can also significantly affect our average dialysis revenue per treatment. In 2011, the growth of our government based patients continued to outpace the growth of our commercial patients, which has been a trend that we have experienced for the past several years. We believe the growth in our government based patients is driven primarily by improved mortality and the current economic environment, which impacts the number of individuals that are covered under commercial insurance plans. This trend has negatively impacted our average dialysis revenue per treatment as a result of receiving a larger proportion of our revenue from government based payors, such as Medicare, that reimburse us at lower payment rates. 45 The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011: Revenues Medicare and Medicare assigned plans 58 % Medicaid and Medicaid assigned plans 5 % Other government based programs 3 % Total government based programs 66 % Commercial (including hospital dialysis services) 34 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Government payment rates in the United States are principally determined by federal Medicare and state Medicaid policy. These payment rates have historically had limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reduction as federal and state governments face increasing budget pressures. On January 1, 2011 we implemented Medicares new payment system in which all ESRD payments are made under a single bundled payment rate that, beginning in 2012, will provide for an annual inflation adjustment based upon a market basket index, less a productivity adjustment. Also beginning in 2012, the rule provides for up to a 2% annual payment withhold that can be earned back by the facilities that meet certain defined clinical performance standards. The new payment system reimburses providers based upon a single bundled or average payment for each Medicare treatment provided. This new bundled payment amount is designed to cover all dialysis services which were historically included in the composite rate and all separately billable ESRD services such as pharmaceuticals and laboratory costs. In the past the amount of services that were separately billable accounted for approximately 30% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues. The new bundled payment rate is adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a geographic wage index and certain other factors. The initial 2011 bundled payment rate included reductions of 2.0% from the prior reimbursement and further reduced overall rates by 5.94% tied to an expanded list of case mix adjustors which can be earned back based upon the presence of certain patient characteristics and co modalities at the time of treatment. There are also other provisions which may impact payment including an outlier pool and a low volume facility adjustment with regard to the expanded list of case mix adjusters. These are difficult and, in some cases, have not been possible for our dialysis centers to document and track, which has resulted in lower reimbursement amounts than we would otherwise have received. On April 1, 2011, CMS released an interim final rule correcting the 3.1% transition adjustment factor to properly update the number of ESRD facilities that elected to opt fully into the new Prospective Payment System (PPS). This new rule is prospective and as a result, effective April 1, 2011 we began recognizing revenues in accordance with the new rule, which resulted in an increase in Medicare revenue per treatment of approximately 3.1% in comparison to our levels recorded in the first quarter of 2011. This reduced our transition adjustment to zero for the balance of 2011 and to an aggregate of approximately 0.75% for 2011. On November 1, 2011, CMS issued the final ESRD Prospective Payment System (PPS) rule for 2012. The base rate will increase by 2.1%, representing a market basket increase of 3.0% less a productivity adjustment of 0.9%. The increase in the final base rate for 2012 (2.1%) is slightly greater than the increase of 1.8% stated in the proposed 2012 ESRD PPS rule published in July 2011, and higher than the 1.0% increase recommended by MedPAC. In 2012 and beyond, the ESRD PPS system includes additional quality measures that could result in decreased payments if a dialysis facility fails to meet the standards. Also, beginning January 1, 2014, certain oral only ESRD drugs (currently paid separately to pharmacies under Medicare Part D) will be included in the ESRD bundled payment to dialysis facilities. It is currently unclear how CMS will price the oral only drugs for inclusion in the ESRD bundle in 2014. We believe the new payment system presents additional operating clinical and financial risks that our dialysis centers or billing and other systems may not accurately document and track the appropriate patient specific characteristics, resulting in a reduction or overpayment in the amounts of the payments that we would otherwise be entitled to receive. 46 Dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Our commercial payment rates also include payments for out of network patients that on average are higher than our in network contract rates. In 2011, we were successful in increasing some of our commercial payment rates which contributed to an increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment, which helped offset some of the overall decline in our average dialysis revenue per treatment. In 2011, we also entered into some commercial contracts covering certain patients that will primarily pay us a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided to these patients. We are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors, and payors are aggressive in their negotiations. If our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, this would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, if there are sustained or increased job losses in the United States as a result of current economic conditions, or depending upon changes to the healthcare regulatory system, we could experience a decrease in the number of patients under commercial plans. Approximately 4% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, were from physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are separately billable, with EPO accounting for approximately 3% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. The impact of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals on our overall revenues that are separately billable in 2011 has significantly decreased from prior years primarily as a result of implementing Medicares new single bundled payment system as well as some additional commercial contracts that pay us a single bundled payment rate. Therefore, in 2010 and prior, changes in physician practice patterns, pharmaceutical protocols, pharmaceutical intensities and changes in commercial and governmental payment rates for EPO had a greater significant influence on our revenues. Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment we actually realize. Over the past several years we have invested heavily in upgrades to our systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems and processes. In 2011, we continued to upgrade our information technology systems and implemented process changes and will continue to do so in 2012 to improve our ability to capture the necessary patient characteristics and certain other factors under Medicares new bundled payment system. We believe this will help us capture additional reimbursement amounts from Medicare and enhance our overall billing and collection performance. However, as we continue to make upgrades to our systems and processes, or as payors change their systems and requirements, our collection performance as well as our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment could be negatively impacted. Our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectability of our billings as of the reporting date based upon our actual historical collection experience. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Our annual average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was approximately $330, $337 and $340 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2011, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment decreased by approximately $7 per treatment primarily due to a decline in our Medicare reimbursements as a result of operating in the new single bundled payment system, a decline in the commercial payor mix, and a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. In 2010, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment decreased by approximately $3 per treatment primarily due to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, and a decline in the commercial payor mix, partially offset by an increase of 1.0% in the Medicare composite rate and an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. Commercial payment rates, changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are billed separately, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals 47 under the new Medicare bundled payment rate system including our ability to capture all patient characteristics, and changes in the mix of government and commercial patients may materially impact our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in the future. The principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals, business infrastructure, including the operating costs of our dialysis centers, and compliance costs. However, other cost categories can also represent significant cost variability, such as employee benefit costs and insurance costs. Our average clinical hours per treatment in 2011 were relatively flat or increased slightly compared to 2010, which continues to be impacted by our ability to maintain or reduce clinical teammate turnover and improve training and processes. We are always striving for improved productivity levels, however, changes in federal and state policies or regulatory billing requirements can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. In addition, improvements in the U.S. economy could stimulate additional competition for skilled clinical personnel and result in higher teammate turnover which would adversely affect productivity levels. In 2011 and 2010, we experienced an increase in our clinical labor rates of approximately 2.0% in both years, as clinical labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. However, in 2011, we continued to implement certain cost control initiatives to minimize increases in our clinical labor rates. In addition, in 2011, we experienced an approximately 5.0% increase in our EPO costs. Our new agreement with Amgen requires us to purchase EPO in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of our requirements for erythropoiesis stimulation agents and provides for discounted pricing and rebates, which are subject to various conditions including future pricing levels of EPO and data submission, which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to continue to qualify for discount pricing and rebates. In the initial years of the agreement the total rebate opportunity is less than what was provided for in the agreement that expired at the end of 2011, however, the opportunity for us to earn discounts and rebates increases over the term of the agreement. In 2011, we also experienced increases in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new centers opened, and general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. General and administrative expenses represented 9.9% of our net operating revenues in 2011 as compared to 9.0% in 2010. This represents a fairly significant increase in the dollar amount of our general and administrative expenses primarily related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal and compliance matters, professional fees associated with information technology matters and international growth initiatives, transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of DSI and supporting the growth in some of our ancillary services and strategic initiatives. We expect that these levels of expenditures on general and administrative expenses in 2012 will continue and could possibly increase as we seek out new business opportunities within the dialysis industry or to other healthcare services outside of dialysis, making additional investments in our existing long term initiatives, such as our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, and the expansion of our international operations, as well as investments in improving our information technology infrastructure and the level of support required for our regulatory compliance and legal matters. Outlook for 2012. Our operating income for 2012 is expected to be in the range of $1,200 million to $1,300 million. We also expect our operating cash flows for 2012 to be in the range of $950 million to $1,050 million. These projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections. These risks and uncertainties, among others, include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from commercial payor plans, continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates from commercial payors, which may result in the loss of revenue or patients, a reduction in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates under the Medicare ESRD program or other government based programs, the impact of healthcare legislation that was enacted in the United States in March 2010, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex 48 government regulations, current or potential investigations by various government entities and related government or private party proceedings, continued increased competition from large and medium sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us, our ability to complete any acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, or integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire, and expansion of our operations and services to markets outside of the United States, or to businesses outside of dialysis. You should read Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the cautionary language contained in the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page 43 for more information about these and other potential risks. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise. Results of operations We operate principally as a dialysis and related lab services business in the United States but also operate other ancillary services and strategic initiatives. These ancillary services and strategic initiatives consist primarily of pharmacy services, infusion therapy services, disease management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research programs, physician services and our international dialysis operations. The U.S. dialysis and related lab services business qualifies as a separately reportable segment and all of the other ancillary services and strategic initiatives have been combined and disclosed in the other segments category. Following is a summary of consolidated operating results for reference in the discussion that follows. The operating results of DSI are included in our operating results effective September 1, 2011. Year ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Net operating revenues: Current period services $ 6,982 100 % $ 6,438 100 % $ 6,101 100 % Operating expenses and charges: Patient care costs 4,681 67 % 4,467 69 % 4,242 70 % General and administrative 691 10 % 579 9 % 532 9 % Depreciation and amortization 267 4 % 234 4 % 228 4 % Provision for uncollectible accounts 198 3 % 171 3 % 161 3 % Goodwill impairment charge 24 Equity investment income (9 ) (9 ) (2 ) Total operating expenses and charges 5,851 84 % 5,441 84 % 5,161 85 % Operating income $ 1,131 16 % $ 997 16 % $ 940 15 % The following table summarizes consolidated net operating revenues: Year ended 2011 2010 2009 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 6,485 $ 6,063 $ 5,784 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives 514 384 334 Total segment revenues 6,999 6,447 6,118 Elimination of intersegment revenues (17 ) (9 ) (17 ) Consolidated net operating revenues $ 6,982 $ 6,438 $ 6,101 49 The following table summarizes consolidated operating income: Year ended 2011(1) 2010 2009 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Dialysis and related lab services $ 1,225 $ 1,039 $ 994 Other ancillary services and strategic initiatives loss (54 ) (6 ) (12 ) Total segment operating income 1,171 1,034 982 Reconciling items: Stock based compensation (49 ) (46 ) (44 ) Equity investment income 9 9 2 Consolidated operating income 1,131 997 940 Reconciliation of non GAAP measure: Add: Goodwill impairment charge 24 Non GAAP consolidated operating income $ 1,155 $ 997 $ 940 (1) For the year ended December 31, 2011 we have excluded a non cash goodwill impairment charge from operating expenses and operating income because management believes that this presentation enhances a users understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding a non cash goodwill impairment charge that resulted from a decrease in the implied fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount associated with HomeChoice Partners (HCP), which provides infusion therapy services, during the second quarter of 2011 and is therefore more meaningful and comparable to our prior period results and more indicative of our normal consolidated operating income. Consolidated net operating revenues Consolidated net operating revenues for 2011 increased by approximately $544 million or approximately 8.5% from 2010. This increase was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $422 million, principally due to strong volume growth from additional treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions including the acquisition of DSI, partially offset by a decline of $7 in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, primarily from a decrease in our Medicare revenues as a result of operating in the new single bundled payment system, as described above. Consolidated net operating revenues also increased as a result of an increase of approximately $130 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services and from our disease management services. Consolidated net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $337 million or approximately 5.5% from 2009. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $279 million, principally due to an increase in the number of treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decline of $3 in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, as described above, and an increase of approximately $50 million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services and from our infusion therapy services. Consolidated operating income Consolidated operating income of $1,131 million for 2011 increased by approximately $134 million, or 13.4%, from 2010 which includes the $24 million HCP goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this item, consolidated operating income would have increased by $158 million, or 15.8%, primarily due to an increase in the dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues as a result of strong volume growth in revenue from additional treatments as a result of non acquired growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decline in our 50 average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $7, as described below. Consolidated operating income also increased as a result of overall lower pharmaceutical costs mainly from a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, additional operating income from the acquisition of DSI and from cost control initiatives. However, consolidated operating income was negatively impacted by higher labor and benefit costs, an increase in our professional fees for compliance and legal initiatives, and for information technology matters, transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of DSI, an increase in EPO pharmaceutical costs and an increase in expenses associated with our international expansion. Consolidated operating income of $997 million for 2010 increased by approximately $57 million, or 6.1%, from 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue as a result of additional treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions in dialysis and related lab services, partially offset by a decline in our average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3, as described below. Operating income also increased as a result of continued cost control initiatives, improved productivity, overall lower pharmaceutical costs and lower operating losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, partially offset by the negative impact on our operating margin from a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, higher labor costs and increases in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Operating segments Dialysis and Related Lab Services Year ended 2011 2010 2009 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million, exceptper treatment data) Revenues $ 6,485 $ 6,063 $ 5,784 Segment operating income $ 1,225 $ 1,039 $ 994 Dialysis treatments 19,599,472 17,963,862 16,984,959 Average dialysis treatments per treatment day 62,618 57,392 54,352 Average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment $ 330 $ 337 $ 340 Net operating revenues Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2011 increased by approximately $422 million or approximately 7.0% from 2010. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to strong volume growth from additional treatments of approximately 9.1% due to an increase in non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions, which includes additional treatments associated with the acquisition of DSI. However, this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $7, or 2.1%. The decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2011, as compared to 2010, was primarily due to a decline in our Medicare reimbursements as a result of operating in the new single bundled payment system, continued decline in the commercial payor mix and a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, partially offset by an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. Dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $279 million or approximately 4.8% from 2009. The increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of treatments of approximately 5.8% due to an increase in non acquired treatment growth at existing and new centers and growth through acquisitions. However, this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3, or 0.9%. The decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2010, as compared to 2009, was primarily due to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals and a decline in the commercial payor mix, partially offset by a 1% increase in the Medicare composite rate and an increase in some of our commercial payment rates. 51 The following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues by modality for the year ended December 31, 2011: Revenuepercentages Outpatient hemodialysis centers 81 % Peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis 14 % Hospital inpatient hemodialysis 5 % Total dialysis and related lab services revenues 100 % Approximately 66% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 were from government based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare assigned plans, representing approximately 89% of our total patients. Over the last several years, we have been experiencing growth in our government based patients that has been outpacing the growth in our commercial patients which has negatively impacted our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment. Our overall percentage of patients and revenues associated with commercial payors continued to decline in 2011. Less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are due directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for more than 6% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. On average we are paid significantly more for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans in the United States than we are for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other government plans such as Medicare assigned plans. Patients covered by commercial health plans transition to Medicare coverage after a maximum of 33 months. As a patient transitions from commercial coverage to Medicare or Medicaid coverage, the payment rates normally decline substantially. Medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis treatments, and therefore we lose money on each Medicare treatment. Nearly all of our net earnings from our dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at established contract rates and others which pay negotiated payment rates based on our usual and customary fee schedule for our out of network patients. If we experience a net overall reduction in our contracted and non contracted commercial rates as a result of these negotiations or restrictions, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors, including our commercial payment rates, government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals under the new Medicare bundled payment rate system, including our ability to capture all patient characteristics, changes in the mix of government and commercial patients, and changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are billed separately. Operating expenses and charges Patient care costs. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and operating costs of the dialysis centers. The dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $217 and $232 for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The $15 decrease in the per treatment costs in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, continued cost control initiatives, partially offset by higher labor and benefit costs, and higher EPO costs. Dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $232 and $235 for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The $3 decrease in the per treatment costs in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, a decrease in our overall pharmaceutical costs and continued improvements in productivity, partially offset by higher labor rates. 52 General and administrative expenses. Dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses for the years ended 2011, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $551 million, $471 million and $428 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $80 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to increases in labor and benefit costs, an increase in our professional expenses for legal and compliance initiatives and for information technology matters as well as transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of DSI. The increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $43 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to increases in labor and benefit costs, partially offset by the timing of certain other expenditures. Depreciation and amortization. Dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $260 million, $227 million and $221 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $33 million in depreciation and amortization for dialysis and related lab services in 2011 and $6 million in 2010 were primarily due to growth through new center developments and acquisitions. Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for dialysis and related lab services was 2.9% for 2011, 2.7% for 2010, and 2.7% for 2009. The increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts during 2011 was primarily the result of a slowdown in our historical collection experience from some of our non government payors. The current provision level of 3.0% at the end of 2011 may increase if we encounter problems with our billing and collection process as a result of sustained weakness in the U.S. economy. Segment operating income Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2011 increased by approximately $186 million as compared to 2010. The increase in the operating income for 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to strong treatment growth as a result of additional dialysis treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $7 as described above. The dialysis and related lab services operating income also increased as a result of a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, and additional operating income from the acquisition of DSI. However, the dialysis and related lab services operating income was negatively impacted by higher labor and benefit costs, an increase in the cost of EPO, an increase in our professional fees in conjunction with compliance and legal initiatives and for information technology matters as well as transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of DSI. Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2010 increased by approximately $45 million as compared to 2009. The increase in the operating income for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to growth in the number of dialysis treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $3 as described above. The dialysis and related lab services operating income also increased as a result of certain cost control initiatives, improved productivity, and overall lower pharmaceutical costs. However, the dialysis and related lab services operating income was negatively impacted by an operating margin decrease due to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals, higher labor costs and an increase in other operating costs of our dialysis centers. Other Ancillary services and strategic initiatives Year ended 2011 2010 2009 (dollar amounts rounded to nearest million) Revenues $ 514 $ 384 $ 334 Segment operating loss $ (54 ) $ (6 ) $ (12 ) 53 Net operating revenues The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2011 increased by approximately $130 million or 33.9% as compared to 2010, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, and from our disease management services. The ancillary services and strategic initiatives net operating revenues for 2010 increased by approximately $50 million or 15.0% as compared to 2009, primarily from growth in pharmacy services, and from our infusion therapy services, partially offset by a decline in our net operating revenues in our disease management services as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. Operating expenses Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2011 increased by approximately $179 million from 2010, which includes the $24 million HCP goodwill impairment charged as described below. Excluding this item, ancillary services and strategic initiatives adjusted operating expenses would have increased by $155 million. This increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business, an increase in expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion and an increase in labor and benefit costs. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2010 increased by approximately $43 million from 2009, primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business and an increase in labor costs, partially offset by lower operating costs of our disease management services as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. Goodwill In the second quarter of 2011, we determined that circumstances indicated it was more likely than not that the fair value of one of our ancillary businesses, HCP, which provides infusion therapy services, was less than its carrying amount. The primary factor informing our conclusion was the recent decline in the operating performance of HCP caused mainly by rapid expansion. This led management to revise its view of HCPs organizational growth capability and scale back significantly its current plans for HCPs future growth initiatives and to update HCPs forecasts and current operating budgets accordingly. These revisions reflected the current and expected future cash flows that we believed market participants would use in determining the fair value or the HCP business. As a result, in the second quarter of 2011, we estimated that the carrying amount of goodwill related to HCP exceeded its implied fair value by $24 million, resulting in a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of that amount. As of December 31, 2011, after giving effect to this impairment charge, we have approximately $32 million of HCP goodwill remaining. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we finalized our calculation of this impairment charge, which did not change the goodwill impairment charge previously recorded. Segment operating loss Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2011 increased by approximately $48 million from 2010, which includes the $24 million HCP goodwill impairment charge, as described above. Excluding this item, ancillary services and strategic initiatives adjusted operating losses would have increased by $24 million. This increase in operating losses was primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion and a deterioration in the operating performance of our infusion therapy services, partially offset by an increase in the operating performance of our pharmacy business, and in our vascular access services. Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2010 decreased by approximately $6 million from 2009. The decrease in operating losses was primarily due to volume growth in revenues associated with our pharmacy business, and a decrease in operating losses in our disease management business as a result of discontinuing the full service health care plans at the end of 2009. 54 Corporate level charges Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation of approximately $49 million for 2011 increased by approximately $3 million from 2010. Stock based compensation of approximately $46 million for 2010 increased by approximately $2 million from 2009. The increase in 2011 resulted from an increase in the overall grant date fair value for the grant years that contributed expense to 2011, driven by both an increase in the grant date fair value of 2011 grants over that for recent years and an increase in the number of awards granted in 2011 over 2010. The increase in 2010 resulted principally from an increase in the overall grant date fair value for the grant years that contributed expense to 2010, driven in part by a substantial increase in the grant date fair value of 2010 grants over that for recent years offset by a significant reduction in the number of awards granted in 2010. Debt expense. Debt expense for 2011, 2010, and 2009 consisted of interest expense of approximately $231 million, $172 million, and $176 million, respectively, including the amortization and accretion of debt discounts and premiums and the amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $10 million in 2011, $9 million in 2010 and $10 million in 2009. The increase in interest expense in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily related to additional borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities that were issued in the fourth quarter of 2010 and additional borrowings associated with the new Term Loan A 2 that contain significantly higher interest rates than our previous facility. In addition, debt expense in 2011 was also impacted by the amount of interest rate swaps that resulted in a higher overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Term Loan A and from the amortization of an interest rate cap premium associated with our Term Loan B. However, debt expense in 2011 benefited from lower rates and lower outstanding balances associated with our new senior notes that were issued in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2011 was 5.28% as compared to 4.68% in 2010. The decrease in interest expense in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily related to lower average outstanding principal balances on our previously outstanding Term Loan A, lower average outstanding principal balances on our previously outstanding senior notes, lower interest rates associated with the issuance of our New Senior Notes and a decrease in our weighted average effective interest rate on the Term Loan B as a result of lower notional amounts of fixed rate swap agreements that contained higher rates. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2010 was 4.68% as compared to 4.86% in 2009. However, interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2010 was negatively affected by the refinancing of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities that occurred on October 20, 2010, as the interest rates under our new Senior Secured Credit Facilities are substantially higher than the interest rates under the previous facility. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in the fourth quarter of 2010 was 4.86%. Equity investment income. Equity investment income was approximately $9.0 million in 2011 as compared to $9.0 million in 2010 and $2.4 million in 2009. Equity investment income in 2011 as compared to 2010 was flat but was impacted by an increase in the profitability of certain of our nonconsolidated joint ventures, offset by a decrease in the operating performance of certain other joint ventures. The increase in equity investment income in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the profitability of our nonconsolidated joint ventures. Other income. Other income was approximately $3 million, $3 million, and $4 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, and consisted principally of interest income. Other income in 2011 was slightly down from 2010, primarily as a result of lower average interest rates and lower average cash balances. The decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily the result of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash balances. Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for 2011 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 35.4%, compared with 35.0% and 36.7% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2011 was higher primarily due to non deductible transaction costs associated with the DSI acquisition. 55 Impairments and valuation adjustments. We perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, and our investments in ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that an impairment review is warranted. Such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans, the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance. Goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies. These types of adjustments are charged directly to the corresponding operating segment that incurred the charge. Except for the HCP goodwill charge in 2011, there were no other significant impairments or valuation adjustments recognized during the periods presented. Noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $95 million, $79 million and $57 million, respectively. The increases in noncontrolling interests in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to increases in the number of new joint ventures and increases in the profitability of our dialysis related joint ventures. The percentage of dialysis and related lab services net operating revenues generated from dialysis related joint ventures was approximately 18% in both 2011 and 2010. Accounts receivable Our accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2011 and 2010 represented approximately 61 days of revenue for both periods, net of bad debt allowance. Our days outstanding in 2011, represent solid improved cash collections that enabled us to keep pace with our growth in revenue. However, our cash collections in early 2012 could be negatively impacted as Medicare upgrades its systems to meet their new billing requirements. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, approximately $188 million and $153 million in unreserved accounts receivable, respectively, representing approximately 16% and 15% of our total accounts receivable balance, respectively, were more than six months old. During 2011, we experienced improved cash collections from certain government payors and certain commercial payors. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Less than 1% of our revenues are classified as patient pay. Substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. Amounts pending approval from third party payors as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $57 million in 2011 and $46 million in 2010, associated with Medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. Currently, a significant portion of our Medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. However, the payment received from Medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. Such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. As a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements, except for potentially limiting the collectability of these Medicare bad debt claims. Liquidity and capital resources Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2011, our cash balance was $394 million and we had undrawn credit under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $350 million, of which approximately $52 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings. Cash flow from operations during 2011 amounted to $1,180 million, compared with $840 million for 2010. The increase in our operating cash flows in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to improved cash earnings, a reduction in income tax payments and the timing of other working capital items, partially offset by an 56 increase in our accounts receivable balances from growth in revenue. Cash flow from operations in 2011 included cash interest payments of approximately $236 million and cash tax payments of $146 million. Cash flow from operations in 2010 included cash interest payments of approximately $191 million and cash tax payments of $207 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2011 included $436 million for capital asset expenditures, including $176 million for new center developments and relocations, and $260 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $1,077 million for acquisitions. During 2011, we also received $49 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, the majority of these proceeds was either used to repurchase other investments or was used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, during 2011, we received $32 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $101 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $21 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 3.8 million shares of our common stock for approximately $323 million. Non operating cash outflows in 2010 included $279 million for capital asset expenditures, including $120 million for new center developments and relocations, and $159 million for maintenance and information technology. We also spent an additional $189 million for acquisitions. During 2010, we also received $61 million from the maturity and sale of investments. However, these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition, during 2010, we received $60 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $84 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $10 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. We also repurchased 8.9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $619 million. During 2011, we acquired a total of 178 dialysis centers, eight of which were located outside of the United States, opened 65 new dialysis centers, sold two centers, merged seven centers, and divested a total of 30 dialysis centers in connection with the acquisition of DSI. We also added three dialysis centers under management and administrative service agreements that are located outside of the United States and added one center in which we own a minority equity interest. During 2010, we acquired a total of 41 dialysis centers, opened 65 new dialysis centers, sold six centers, closed 18 centers, and made minority equity investments in three centers that were previously under management and administrative service agreements. Acquisition On September 2, 2011, we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of CDSI I Holding Company, Inc., the parent company of dialysis provider DSI Renal Inc. (DSI), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger for approximately $723 million in net cash, plus the assumption of certain liabilities totaling approximately $6.5 million, subject to certain post closing adjustments. DSI had 113 outpatient dialysis centers that provided services to approximately 8,000 patients in 23 states. We also incurred approximately $22 million in transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2011 associated with this acquisition that are included in general and administrative expenses. Pursuant to a consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission on September 2, 2011, we agreed to divest a total of 30 outpatient dialysis centers and several home based dialysis programs in order to complete the acquisition of DSI. In conjunction with the consent order, on September 30, 2011, we completed the sale of 28 outpatient dialysis centers to Dialysis Newco, Inc., or Dialysis Newco, a portfolio company of Frazier Healthcare VI, L.P. and New Enterprise Associates 13, Limited Partnership pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated August 26, 2011. Effective October 31, 2011, we also completed the sale of two additional outpatient dialysis centers to Dialysis Newco that were previously pending state regulatory approval. We anticipate receiving total net cash consideration of approximately $82.0 million for all of the outpatient dialysis centers that were divested. 57 2011 capital structure changes and other items On August 26, 2011, we entered into an Increase Joinder Agreement under our existing Senior Secured Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Increase Joinder Agreement, we increased the revolving credit facility by $100 million, to a total of $350 million, and entered into an additional $200 million Term Loan A 2. The new Term Loan A 2 required a principal payment of $0.5 million on December 31, 2011 and thereafter requires annual principal payments of $2.0 million with the balance of $191.5 million due in 2016, and bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.00%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.50% subject to a rating based step down to 3.25%. During the year ended December 31, 2011 we made mandatory principal payments under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities totaling $50 million on the Term Loan A, $0.5 million on Term Loan A 2 and $17.5 million on the Term Loan B. Interest rate swaps and caps In January 2011, we entered into nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1.0 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011, as a means of hedging our exposure to and volatility from variable based interest rate changes as part of our overall risk management strategy. As of December 31, 2011, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $950 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan A to fixed rates ranging from 1.59% to 1.64%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 4.11%, including the Term Loan A margin of 2.50%. The swap agreements expire by September 30, 2014 and require monthly interest payments. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we accrued net charges of $12.6 million from these swaps which are included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2011, the total fair value of these swap agreements was a liability of $23.1 million. We estimate that approximately $10.9 million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2011 will be reclassified into income over the next year. In addition, in January 2011, we also entered into five interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling $1.25 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 4.00% on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan B debt. The cap agreements expire on September 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2011, the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of $1.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded $5.2 million, net of tax, as a decrease to other comprehensive income due to unrealized valuation changes in the cap agreements, net of the amortization of the interest rate cap premiums that were reclassified into net income. As a result of the swap and cap agreements, our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 4.61%, based upon the current margins in effect of 2.50% for the Term Loan A, 3.50% for the Term Loan A 2 and 3.00% for the Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, interest rates on our Term Loan A 2 and Term Loan B are set at their LIBOR floors plus their interest rate margins. Interest rates on our senior notes and Term Loan A are fixed and economically fixed, respectively, with rates on the $1.25 billion of our Term Loan B subject to interest rate caps. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2011 was 5.28% and as of December 31, 2011 was 5.27%. Stock repurchases During 2011, we repurchased a total of 3,794,686 shares of our common stock for $323.3 million, or an average price of $85.21 per share, pursuant to a previously announced authorization by the Board of Directors on 58 November 3, 2010, that authorized an additional $800 million of share repurchases of our common stock. As a result of these transactions, the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2011 was $358.2 million. We have not repurchased any additional shares of our common stock from January 1, 2012 through February 24, 2012. This stock repurchase program has no expiration date. Stock based compensation Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the straight line amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards are generally issued from shares in treasury. We have utilized the Black Scholes Merton valuation model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights granted in all prior periods. During 2011, we granted 2,707,500 stock settled stock appreciation rights with a grant date fair value of $59.4 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 4.2 years, and also granted 150,246 stock units with a grant date fair value of $12.8 million and a weighted average expected life of approximately 3.1 years. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recognized $48.7 million and $45.6 million, respectively, in stock based compensation expense for stock settled stock appreciation rights, stock options, stock units and discounted employee stock plan purchases, which is primarily included in general and administrative expenses. The estimated tax benefits recorded for this stock based compensation in 2011 and 2010 were $18.4 million and $17.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, there was $91.3 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock settled compensation arrangements under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we received $5.4 million and $48.7 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and $38.2 million and $26.7 million, respectively, in total actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. Other items On July 22, 2010, we entered into a First National Service Provider Agreement, or the Agreement, with NxStage Medical Inc., or NxStage. Under the terms of the Agreement we have the ability to continue to purchase NxStage System One hemodialysis machines and related supplies at discount prices. In addition, we may, in lieu of cash rebate, vest in warrants to purchase NxStage common stock based upon achieving certain System One home patient growth targets by June 30, 2011, 2012 and 2013. The warrants are exercisable for up to a cumulative total of 5.5 million shares of common stock over the three years at an initial exercise price of $14.22 per share. From the period July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011, we earned warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of NxStage common stock. In October 2011 we exercised our right to purchase 250,000 shares of NxStage common stock at $14.22 per share, for a total of approximately $3.6 million and in February 2012, we sold all 250,000 shares for approximately $5.2 million. In July 2010, we announced that we will construct a new corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado. In July 2010, we acquired the land and existing improvements for approximately $12 million. Effective December 18, 2010, we entered into a construction agreement for the construction of the new building. We currently estimate the total construction costs and other project costs of the building will be approximately $95 million. Construction began in early 2011, and is still estimated to be complete in the second half of 2012. Through December 31, 2011, we have paid construction costs and architecture and other design fees totaling approximately $49 million. 2010 capital structure changes On October 20, 2010, we entered into a $3,000 million Senior Secured Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), consisting of a five year $250 million revolving line of credit, a five year $1,000 million Term Loan 59 A and a six year $1,750 million Term Loan B. We also have the right to request an increase to the borrowing capacity to a total aggregate principal amount of not more than $4,000 million subject to bank participation. The revolving line of credit and the Term Loan A initially bore interest at LIBOR plus an interest rate margin of 2.75% until June 30, 2011, when the interest rate margin was reduced to 2.50%. The interest rate margin is still subject to adjustment depending upon our leverage ratio and can range from 2.25% to 2.75%. The Term Loan A requires annual principal payments of $50 million in 2011, $50 million in 2012, $100 million in 2013, and $150 million in 2014, with the balance of $650 million due in 2015. The Term Loan B bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.50%) plus 3.00% subject to a ratings based step down to 2.75%. The Term Loan B requires annual principal payments of $17.5 million in each year from 2011 through 2015 with the balance of $1,663 million due in 2016. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of DaVitas and its guarantors assets. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants such as various restrictions on investments, acquisitions, the payment of dividends, redemptions and acquisitions of capital stock, capital expenditures and other indebtedness, as well as limitations on the amount of tangible net assets in non guarantor subsidiaries. However, many of these restrictions will not apply as long as our leverage ratio is below 3.50:1.00. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires compliance with financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio and a leverage ratio that determines the interest rate margins as described above. On October 20, 2010, we also issued $775 million aggregate principal amount of 6  3/8% senior notes due 2018 and $775 million aggregate principal amount of 6  5/8% senior notes due 2020 (the New Senior Notes). The New Senior Notes will pay interest on May 1 and November 1, of each year beginning May 1, 2011. The New Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally to other unsecured senior indebtedness. The New Senior Notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. We may redeem some or all of the 6  3/8% senior notes at any time on or after November 1, 2013 at certain redemption prices and may redeem some or all of the 6 5/8% senior notes at any time on or after November 1, 2014 at certain redemption prices. We received total proceeds of $4,300 million from these transactions, $2,750 million from the borrowings on Term Loan A and Term Loan B and an additional $1,550 million from the issuance of the New Senior Notes. We used a portion of the proceeds to pay off the outstanding principal balances of our existing senior secured credit facilities plus accrued interest totaling $1,795 million and to purchase pursuant to a cash tender offer $558 million of the outstanding principal balances of our $700 million 6 5/8% senior notes due 2013 and $731 million of the outstanding balances of our $850 million 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015 (the Existing Notes), plus accrued interest totaling $1,297 million. The total amount paid for the Existing Notes was $1,019.06 per $1,000 principal amount of the 6  5/8% senior notes and $1,038.75 per $1,000 principal amount of the 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes. This resulted in us paying a cash tender premium of $39 million in order to extinguish this portion of the Existing Notes. On November 19, 2010, we redeemed the remaining outstanding balance of the existing 6  5/8% senior notes of $142 million at 101.656% per $1,000 and the remaining outstanding balance of the existing 7 1/4% senior subordinated notes of $119 million at 103.625% per $1,000 plus accrued interest totaling $265 million. In addition, we paid a call premium totaling $7 million. We also paid an additional $74 million in fees, discounts and other expenses. As a result of the above transactions, we received approximately $823 million in excess cash which we have been using for general purposes and other opportunities, including share repurchases, acquisitions and other growth investments. In connection with these transactions, we expensed debt refinancing and redemption charges totaling $70.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, which includes the write off of certain existing deferred financing costs and other new financing costs, the cash tender and call premiums, as described above and other expenses. On June 7, 2010, we redeemed $200 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6  5/8% senior notes due 2013, at a price of 101.656% plus accrued interest. As a result of this transaction, we expensed debt redemption charges of $4.1 million, which includes the call premium and the net write off of other finance costs. 60 Senior Secured Credit Facilities and senior and senior subordinated notes During 2010, we made mandatory principal payments totaling $65.6 million on our prior outstanding Term Loan A. We did not make any principal payments on Term Loan B during 2010, nor were we required to. All of the outstanding balances under the prior Term Loan A, Term Loan B and the senior and senior subordinated notes were extinguished as part of our debt refinancing transactions that occurred on October 20, 2010, as described above. Stock repurchases During 2010, we repurchased a total of 8,918,760 shares of our common stock for $618.5 million, or an average price of $69.35 per share, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of Directors. Interest rate swaps Our previous interest rate swap agreements expired on September 30, 2010. The agreements that were effective during 2010 had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our debt to fixed rates ranging from 4.05% to 4.70%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 5.84% on the hedged portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the Term Loan B margin of 1.50%. During 2010 and 2009, we accrued net cash obligations of approximately $9.1 million and $17.3 million, respectively, from these swaps, which are included in debt expense. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 4.05%, based upon the current margins in effect of 2.75% for the Term Loan A and 3.00% for the Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, interest rates on our Term Loan B are set at its LIBOR floors plus its interest rate margin and interest rates on our senior notes are fixed. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2010 was 4.68% and as of December 31, 2010 was 4.94%. Off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases and letters of credit as well as potential obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated businesses and to dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties. Substantially all of our facilities are leased. We have potential acquisition obligations for several joint ventures and for some of our non wholly owned subsidiaries in the form of put provisions. If these put provisions were exercised, we would be required to purchase the third party owners noncontrolling interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the noncontrolling interests put to us, which is intended to approximate fair value. For additional information see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements. We also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several other dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties or centers in which we own an equity investment, as well as to physicianowned vascular access clinics that we operate under management and administrative services agreements. 61 The following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011 (in millions): Less Than1 year 2 3years 4 5years After5 years Total Scheduled payments under contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 85 $ 297 $ 2,531 $ 1,557 $ 4,470 Interest payments on the senior notes 100 202 202 279 783 Interest payments on the Term Loan B(1) 79 155 137 371 Interest payments on the Term Loan A 2(2) 9 18 16 43 Capital lease obligations 2 5 4 32 43 Operating leases 258 444 370 636 1,708 Construction of the new corporate headquarters 46 46 $ 579 $ 1,121 $ 3,260 $ 2,504 $ 7,464 Potential cash requirements under existing commitments: Letters of credit $ 52 $ $ $ $ 52 Noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions 260 98 76 44 478 Pay fixed swaps potential obligations 11 12 23 Operating capital advances 4 4 $ 327 $ 110 $ 76 $ 44 $ 557 (1) Assuming no changes to LIBOR based interest rates as the Term Loan B currently bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.50%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.00%. (2) Assuming no changes to LIBOR based interest rates as the Term Loan A 2 currently bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 1.00%) plus an interest rate margin of 3.50% The pay fixed swap obligations represent the estimated fair market values of our interest rate swap agreements as reported by various broker dealers that are based upon relevant observable market inputs as well as other current market conditions that existed as of December 31, 2011, and represent the estimated potential obligation that we would be required to pay based upon the estimated future settlement of each specific tranche over the term of the swap agreements, assuming no future changes in the forward yield curve. The actual amount of our obligation associated with these swaps in the future will depend upon changes in the LIBOR based interest rates that can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions, and other relevant factors that can affect the fair market value of these swap agreements. In addition to the above commitments, we are obligated to purchase a certain amount of our hemodialysis products and supplies at fixed prices through 2015 from Gambro Renal Products, Inc. in connection with the Product Supply Agreement. Our total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs in each year. In January 2010, we entered into an agreement with Fresenius which committed us to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies from them through 2013. Our total expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2011 on such products were approximately 2% of our total operating costs. The actual amount of purchases in future years from Gambro Renal Products and Fresenius will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, growth of our existing centers, and in the case of the Product Supply Agreement, Gambro Renal Products ability to meet our needs. In November 2011, we entered into a seven year Sourcing and Supply Agreement with Amgen USA Inc. that expires on December 31, 2018. Under the terms of the agreement we will purchase EPO in amounts 62 necessary to meet no less than 90% of our requirements for erythropoiesis stimulating agents. The actual amount of EPO that we will purchase from Amgen will depend upon the amount of EPO administered during dialysis as prescribed by physicians and the overall number of patients that we serve. Settlements of approximately $12 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made. Contingencies The information in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements of this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, contingencies and temporary equity. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of long lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly and annual variable compensation accruals, purchase accounting valuation estimates, fair value estimates and stock based compensation are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. Revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patients commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. Effective January 1, 2011, our reimbursements from Medicare became subject to certain variations under Medicares new single bundled payment rate system whereby our reimbursements can be adjusted for certain patient characteristics and certain other factors. Our revenue recognition depends upon our ability to effectively capture, document and bill for Medicares base payment rate and these other factors. In addition, as a result of the potential range of variations that can occur in our reimbursements from Medicare under the new single bundled payment rate system, our revenue recognition is now subject to a greater degree of estimating risk. Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans 63 with which we have formal agreements, non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, slow down in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than 142,000 patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource intensive processes. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as 6% of consolidated operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant. Lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received. Impairments of long lived assets. We account for impairments of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, equity investments in non consolidated businesses, amortizable intangible assets with finite useful lives and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. Impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers or other operations. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year, and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized. We are required to assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and to also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. These calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain and future events unpredictable. Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses, and other awards, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. Actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our Board of Directors. 64 Purchase accounting valuation estimates. We make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and contractual as well as non contractual contingencies associated with our acquisitions. These assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future. Fair value estimates. We have recorded certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests (temporary equity) subject to put provisions at fair value. The FASB defines fair value which is measured based upon certain valuation techniques that include inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. We have measured the fair values of our applicable assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions based upon certain market inputs and assumptions that are either observable or unobservable in determining fair values and have also classified these assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels. The fair value of our investments available for sale are based upon quoted market prices from active markets and the fair value of our swap and cap agreements were based upon valuation models utilizing the income approach and commonly accepted valuation techniques that use inputs from closing prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as well as other relevant observable market inputs at quoted intervals such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, implied volatility and credit default swap pricing. For our noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions we have estimated the fair values of these based upon either the higher of a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators, as well as other factors. During the second quarter of 2010, we refined the methodology used to estimate the fair value of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions by eliminating an annual inflation factor that was previously applied to the put provisions until they became exercisable. We believe that eliminating an annual inflation factor will result in a better representation of the estimated actual fair value of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. The estimate of the fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners noncontrolling interests. Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation recognized in a period represents the straight line amortization during that period of the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards over their vesting terms, adjusted for expected forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk free interest rates. Significant new accounting standards On January 1, 2012, we adopted FASBs Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. This standard amends the current two step goodwill impairment test required under the existing accounting guidance. This amendment allows entities the option to first assess certain qualitative factors to ascertain whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount to determine if the two step impairment test is necessary. If an entity concludes that certain events or circumstances prove that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then an entity is required to proceed to step one of the two step goodwill impairment test. This standard is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 65 On January 1, 2012, we adopted FASBs ASU No. 2011 07, Health Care Entities Presentation and Disclosure of Patient Service Revenue, Provision for Bad Debts, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This standard amends the current presentation and disclosure requirements for Health Care Entities that recognize significant amounts of patient service revenue at the time the services are rendered without assessing the patients ability to pay. This standard requires health care entities to reclassify the provision for bad debts from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenues. In addition, this standard requires more disclosure on the policies for recognizing revenue, assessing bad debts, as well as quantitative and qualitative information regarding changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts. This standard is applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented and is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard will require us to change the presentation in our financial statements. On January 1, 2012, we adopted FASBs ASU No. 2011 05, Comprehensive Income Presentation of Comprehensive Income. This standard amends the current presentation requirements for comprehensive income by eliminating the presentation of the components of other comprehensive income within the statement of equity. This standard allows two options on how to present the various components of comprehensive income. These options are either to report the components of comprehensive income separately on the income statement or to present total other comprehensive income and the components of other comprehensive income in a separate statement. This standard does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item must be reclassified into net income. This standard is applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard will require us to change the presentation in our financial statements. On January 1, 2012, we adopted FASBs ASU No. 2011 04, Fair Value Measurement. This standard amends the current fair value measurement and disclosure requirements to improve comparability between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The intent of this standard is to update the disclosures that describe several of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and to enhance disclosures about fair value measurements which will improve consistency between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. This standard does not change the application of the requirements on fair value measurements and disclosures. This standard is applied prospectively and is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Interest rate sensitivity The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2011. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average LIBOR rates in effect for all debt tranches plus interest rate margins in effect at December 31, 2011. The Term Loan A margin currently in effect is 2.50% and along with the revolving line of credit is subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio.

For the Term Loan A, each tranche bears interest at a LIBOR rate that is determined by the duration of such tranche plus an interest rate margin. The LIBOR variable component of the interest rate for each tranche is reset as such tranche matures and a new tranche is established. LIBOR can fluctuate significantly depending upon conditions in the credit and capital markets. The Term Loan A 2 and Term Loan B are subject to LIBOR floors of 1.00% and 1.50%, respectively. Because LIBOR, as of December 31, 2011, was lower than either of these floors, the interest rates on the Term Loan A 2 and the Term Loan B are treated as fixed for purposes of the table above. We have included both of these Term Loans in the fixed rate totals in the table above until such time as the LIBOR based component of our interest rate exceeds 1.00% on the Term Loan A 2 and 1.50% on the Term Loan B. At such time, we will then be subject to LIBOR based interest rate volatility on the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on all of the Term Loan A 2, as well as for the Term Loan B, but limited to a maximum rate of 4.00% on $1.25 billion of outstanding principal debt on the Term Loan B. The remaining $483 million outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan B is subject to LIBOR based interest rate volatility above a floor of 1.50%. In January 2011, we entered into nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $1.0 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011, as a means of hedging our exposure to and volatility from variable based interest rate changes as part of our overall risk management strategy. As of December 31, 2011, we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling $950 million. These agreements had the economic effect of modifying the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan A to fixed rates ranging from 1.59% to 1.64%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 4.11%, including the Term Loan A margin of 2.50%. The swap agreements expire by September 30, 2014 and require monthly interest payments. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we accrued net charges of $12.6 million from these swaps which are included in debt expense. As of December 31, 2011, the total fair value of these swap agreements was a liability of $23.1 million. We estimate that approximately $10.9 million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2011 will be reclassified into income over the next year. In addition, in January 2011, we also entered into five interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling $1.25 billion that went effective on January 31, 2011. These agreements have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 4.00% on an equivalent amount of our Term Loan B debt. The cap agreements expire on September 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2011, the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of $1.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded $5.2 million, net of tax, as a decrease to other comprehensive income due to unrealized valuation changes in the cap agreements, net of the amortization of the interest rate cap premiums that were reclassified into net income. As a result of the swap and cap agreements, our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 4.61%, based upon the current margins in effect of 2.50% for the Term Loan A, 3.50% for the Term Loan A 2 and 3.00% for the Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2011. 67 As of December 31, 2011, interest rates on our Term Loan A 2 and Term Loan B are set at their LIBOR floors plus their interest rate margins. Interest rates on our senior notes and Term Loan A are fixed and economically fixed, respectively, with rates on the $1.25 billion of our Term Loan B subject to interest rate caps. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2011 was 5.28% and as of December 31, 2011 was 5.27%. One means of assessing exposure to debt related interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model, with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately $0.6 million, $11.1 million, and $8.5 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
