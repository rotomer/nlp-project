BUSINESS GENERAL Devon Energy Corporation, including its subsidiaries, ("Devon" or the "Company") is an independent energy company engaged primarily in oil and gas exploration, development and production, acquisition of producing properties, transportation of oil and gas and processing of natural gas. Through its predecessors, Devon began operations in 1971 as a privately held company. In 1988, the Companys common stock began trading publicly on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol DVN. In addition, commencing on December 15, 1998, a new class of Devon exchangeable shares began trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol NSX. These shares are essentially equivalent to Devon common stock. However, because they are issued by Devons wholly owned subsidiary, Northstar Energy Corporation ("Northstar"), they qualify as a domestic Canadian investment for Canadian institutional shareholders. They are exchangeable at any time, on a one for one basis, for common shares of Devon. The principal and administrative offices of Devon are located at 20 North Broadway, Oklahoma City, OK 73102 8260 (telephone 405/235 3611). Devon currently owns oil and gas properties concentrated in five operating divisions: the Permian/Mid Continent, Rocky Mountain and Gulf divisions include onshore properties in the continental United States and offshore properties primarily in the Gulf of Mexico; Canada, which includes properties in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta and British Columbia; and the International Division, which includes properties in Argentina, Azerbaijan, China, Indonesia and West Africa. In addition, Devon created a sixth operating division to incorporate its U.S. midstream activities with its marketing activities. The responsibilities of the Marketing and Midstream Division include marketing natural gas, crude oil and NGLs. The division is also responsible for the construction and operation of pipelines, storage and treating facilities and gas processing plants. These services are performed for Devon as well as for unrelated third parties. (A detailed description of the significant properties can be found under "Item 2. Properties Significant Properties" beginning on page 16 hereof). At December 31, 2001, Devons estimated proved reserves were 1,620 MMBoe, of which 56% were natural gas reserves and 44% were oil and NGLs reserves. The present value of pre tax future net revenues discounted at 10% per annum assuming essentially constant prices ("10% Present Value") of such reserves was $7.2 billion. After taxes, the present value was $5.3 billion. Devon is one of the top five public independent oil and gas companies based in the United States, as measured by oil and gas reserves. STRATEGY Devons primary objectives are to build reserves, production, cash flow and earnings per share by (a) acquiring oil and gas properties, (b) exploring for new oil and gas reserves and (c) optimizing production and value from existing oil and gas properties. Devons management seeks 4 to achieve these objectives by (a) concentrating its properties in core areas to achieve economies of scale, (b) acquiring and developing high profit margin properties, (c) continually disposing of marginal and non strategic properties, (d) balancing reserves between oil and gas, (e) maintaining a high degree of financial flexibility, and (f) enhancing the value of Devons production through marketing and midstream activities. During 1988, Devon expanded its capital base with its first issuance of common stock to the public. This transaction began a substantial expansion program that has continued through the subsequent years. Devon has used a two pronged strategy of acquiring producing properties and engaging in drilling activities to achieve this expansion. Total proved reserves increased from 8.1 MMBoe at year end 1987 (without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 mergers accounted for as poolings of interests) to 1,620 MMBoe at year end 2001. Devons objective, however, is to increase value per share, not simply to increase total assets. Reserves have grown from 1.31 Boe per share at year end 1987 (without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 poolings) to 12.84 Boe per share at year end 2001. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 17.7%. Another measure of value per share is oil and gas production per share. Production increased from 0.18 Boe per share in 1987 (without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 poolings) to 1.07 Boe per share in 2001, a compound annual growth rate of 13.6%. DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS In August and September 2001, Devon announced two major acquisitions that eventually would almost double its total proved reserves to over two billion Boe. On August 13, 2001, Devon announced an agreement to merge with Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. ("Mitchell"). The terms of this merger called for Devon to issue approximately 30 million shares of Devon common stock and to pay $1.6 billion in cash to the Mitchell stockholders. Although the merger agreement was signed in August 2001, the transaction did not close until January 24, 2002. Therefore, this merger did not affect Devons 2001 reported results. Following the Mitchell merger announcement, Devon announced on September 4, 2001, that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Anderson Exploration Ltd. ("Anderson") for approximately $3.5 billion in cash. This acquisition closed on October 15, 2001, and therefore had an impact on Devons results for the last two and one half months of the year. To fund the cash portions of these two acquisitions, as well as to pay related transaction costs and retire certain long term debt assumed from Mitchell and Anderson, Devon entered into long term debt agreements in October 2001 that totaled $6 billion. As part of this $6 billion total, Devon issued $3 billion of notes and debentures on October 3, 2001. Of this total, $1.25 billion bear interest at 7.875% and mature in September 2031. The remaining $1.75 billion bear interest at 6.875% and mature in September 2011. The remaining $3 billion of the $6 billion of long term debt is in the form of a credit facility that bears interest at floating rates. At December 31, 2001, $1 billion of this facility was borrowed. Following the close of the Mitchell transaction, the $3 billion facility was fully borrowed. Principal payments due on this debt are $0.2 billion in October 2004, $1.2 billion in 5 2005 and $1.6 billion in 2006. The 2005 and 2006 payments are split equally in payments due in April and October of those years. The interest rate on this debt at December 31, 2001 was 2.9%. FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in (Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data) of this report contains information on Devons segments and geographical areas. DRILLING ACTIVITIES Devon is engaged in numerous drilling activities on properties presently owned and intends to drill or develop other properties acquired in the future. Devons 2002 drilling activities will be focused in the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Mid Continent, Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast areas in the U.S., the Western Sedimentary areas of Canada and in China and West Africa outside North America. 6 The following tables set forth the results of Devons drilling activity for the past five years.

(2) Net wells are the sum of Devons working interests in gross wells. 7 As of December 31, 2001, Devon was participating in the drilling of 45 gross (27.58 net) wells in the U.S., 35 gross (23.31 net) wells in Canada and 18 gross (7.96 net) wells internationally. Of these wells, through February 15, 2002, 22 gross (14.24 net) wells in the U.S., 26 gross (18.00 net) wells in Canada and 6 gross (1.15 net) wells internationally had been completed as productive. An additional 2 gross (2.00 net) wells in the U.S., 2 gross (2.00 net) wells in Canada and 1 gross (0.50 net) well internationally were dry holes. The remaining wells were still in process. CUSTOMERS Devon sells its gas production to a variety of customers including pipelines, utilities, gas marketing firms, industrial users and local distribution companies. Existing gathering systems and interstate and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas sales and deliveries. The principal customers for Devons crude oil production are refiners, remarketers and other companies, some of which have pipeline facilities near the producing properties. In the event pipeline facilities are not conveniently available, crude oil is trucked or barged to storage, refining or pipeline facilities. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, one significant purchaser, Enron Capital and Trade Resource Corporation ("Enron"), accounted for 16% and 20%, respectively, of Devons combined oil, gas and NGLs sales. No purchaser accounted for over 10% of such revenues in 1999. Devon does not consider itself dependent upon this purchaser, since other purchasers are willing to purchase this same production at competitive prices. On December 2, 2001, Enron Corp. and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Prior to this date, Devon had terminated substantially all of its agreements to sell oil or gas to Enron related entities. Devon incurred $3 million of losses for sales to Enron related subsidiaries which were not collected prior to the bankruptcy filing. OIL AND NATURAL GAS MARKETING Oil Marketing. Devons oil production is sold under both long term and short term agreements at prices negotiated with third parties. Devon periodically enters into financial commodity hedging activities with a portion of its oil production which are intended to support its oil price at targeted levels and to manage the Companys exposure to oil price fluctuations. (See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.") Natural Gas Marketing. Devons gas production is also sold under both long term and short term agreements at prices negotiated with third parties. Devon periodically enters into financial commodity hedging activities with a portion of its gas production which are intended to support its gas price at targeted levels and to manage the Companys exposure to gas price fluctuations. Although exact percentages vary daily, as of February 2002 approximately 65% of Devons natural gas production was sold under short term contracts at variable or market sensitive prices. These market sensitive sales are referred to as "spot market" sales. Another 26% were committed under various long term contracts (one year or more) which dedicate the natural gas to a purchaser for an 8 extended period of time, but still at market sensitive prices. Devons remaining gas production was sold under fixed price contracts: 8% under short term agreements and 1% under long term contracts. Under both long term and short term contracts, typically either the entire contract (in the case of short term contracts) or the price provisions of the contract (in the case of long term contracts) are re negotiated from daily intervals up to one year intervals. The spot market has become progressively more competitive in recent years. As a result, prices on the spot market have been volatile. The spot market is subject to volatility as supply and demand factors in various regions of North America fluctuate. In addition to fixed price contracts, Devon periodically enters into hedging arrangements or firm delivery commitments with a portion of its gas production. These activities are intended to support targeted gas price levels and to manage the Companys exposure to gas price fluctuations. (See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.") COMPETITION The oil and gas business is highly competitive. Devon encounters competition by major integrated and independent oil and gas companies in acquiring drilling prospects and properties, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Intense competition occurs with respect to marketing, particularly of natural gas. Certain competitors have resources that substantially exceed those of Devon. SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, pipelines, utilities, local distribution companies and industrial users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. GOVERNMENT REGULATION Devons operations are subject to various levels of government controls and regulations in the United States, Canada and internationally. 9 UNITED STATES REGULATION In the United States, legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation, numerous federal, state and local departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas drilling, gas processing plants and production activities, increase the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability. Inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, Devon is unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations. The Company considers the cost of environmental protection a necessary and manageable part of its business. The Company has been able to plan for and comply with new environmental initiatives without materially altering its operating strategies. Exploration and Production. Devons United States operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells; implementing spill prevention plans; submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities, surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production. Devons operations are also subject to various conservation matters, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases, which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally limit the venting or flaring of gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and gas Devon can produce from its wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which Devon can drill. Certain of Devons oil and gas leases, including its offshore Gulf of Mexico leases, most of its leases in the San Juan Basin and many of the Companys leases in southeast New Mexico and Wyoming, are granted by the federal government and administered by various federal agencies, including the Minerals Management Service of the Department of the Interior ("MMS"). Such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders which regulate, among other matters, drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases, and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government. The MMS has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and, in some cases, promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") also has jurisdiction over certain offshore activities pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. 10 Environmental and Occupational Regulations. Various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of contaminants or otherwise relating to the protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment, affect Devons exploration, development, processing, and production operations and the costs attendant thereto. These laws and regulations increase Devons overall operating expenses. Devon maintains levels of insurance customary in the industry to limit its financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and accidental discharges of oil, salt water or other substances. However, 100% coverage is not maintained concerning any environmental claim, and no coverage is maintained with respect to any penalty or fine required to be paid by Devon because of its violation of any federal, state or local law. Devon is committed to meeting its responsibilities to protect the environment wherever it operates and anticipates making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment. Devons unreimbursed expenditures in 2001 concerning such matters were immaterial, but Devon cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its future exposure concerning such matters. The Company considers the cost of environmental protection a necessary and manageable part of its business. The Company has been able to plan for and comply with new environmental initiatives without materially altering its operating strategies. Devon is also subject to laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health. Due to the continued changes in these laws and regulations, and the judicial construction of same, Devon is unable to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its future costs of complying with these laws and regulations. The Company considers the cost of environmental protection a necessary and manageable part of its business. The Company has been able to plan for and comply with new environmental initiatives without materially altering its operating strategies. Devon has historically maintained its own internal Environmental, Health and Safety Department. This department is responsible for instituting and maintaining an environmental and safety compliance program for Devon. The program includes field inspections of properties and internal assessments of Devons compliance procedures. Devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation activities associated with past operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and similar state statutes. In response to potential liabilities associated with these activities, accruals have been established when reasonable estimates are possible. Such accruals primarily include estimated costs associated with remediation. Devon has not used discounting in determining its accrued liabilities for environmental remediation, and no claims for possible recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to environmental costs have been recognized in Devons consolidated financial statements. Devon adjusts the accruals when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become estimable, or when current remediation estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information. Certain of Devons historical operations acquired in historical and recent mergers are involved in matters in which it has been alleged that such subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") under CERCLA or similar state legislation with respect to various waste disposal areas owned or operated by third parties. As of December 31, 2001, Devons consolidated balance sheet 11 included $8 million of accrued liabilities, reflected in "Other liabilities," for environmental remediation. Devon does not currently believe there is a reasonable possibility of incurring additional material costs in excess of the current accruals recognized for such environmental remediation activities. With respect to the sites in which Devon subsidiaries are PRPs, Devons conclusion is based in large part on (i) the availability of defenses to liability, including the availability of the "petroleum exclusion" under CERCLA and similar state laws, and or (ii) Devons current belief that its share of wastes at a particular site is or will be viewed by the Environmental Protection Agency or other PRPs as being de minimis. As a result, Devons monetary exposure is not expected to be material. CANADIAN REGULATIONS The oil and gas industry in Canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government. It is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect Devons Canadian operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size. The following are the most important areas of control and regulation. The North American Free Trade Agreement. The North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA") which became effective on January 1, 1994 carries forward most of the material energy terms contained in the Canada U.S. Free Trade Agreement. In the context of energy resources, Canada continues to remain free to determine whether exports to the United States or Mexico will be allowed, provided that any export restrictions do not (i) reduce the proportion of energy exported relative to the supply of the energy resource; (ii) impose an export price higher than the domestic price; or (iii) disrupt normal channels of supply. All parties to NAFTA are also prohibited from imposing minimum export or import price requirements. Royalties and Incentives. Each province and the federal government of Canada have legislation and regulations governing land tenure, royalties, production rates and taxes, environmental protection and other matters under their respective jurisdictions. The royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production. Royalties payable on production from lands other than Crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties. Crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices, well productivity, geographical location, field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced. From time to time, the governments of Canada, Alberta and British Columbia have also established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions, royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects. These incentives generally have the effect of increasing the cash flow to the producer. Pricing and Marketing. The price of oil and natural gas sold is determined by negotiation between buyers and sellers. An order from the National Energy Board ("NEB") is required for oil exports from Canada. Any oil export to be made pursuant to an export contract of longer than one year, in the case of light crude, and two years, in the case of heavy crude, duration (up to 25 years) requires an exporter to obtain an export license from the NEB. The issue of such a license requires the approval of the Governor in Council. Natural gas exported from Canada is also subject to similar regulation by the NEB. Exporters are free to negotiate prices and other terms with purchasers, provided that the export contracts in excess of two years must continue to meet certain criteria 12 prescribed by the NEB. The governments of Alberta and British Columbia also regulate the volume of natural gas which may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve availability, transportation arrangements and market considerations. Environmental Regulation. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. Environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with certain oil and gas industry operations. In addition, legislation requires that well and facility sites be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities. A breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties. Devon is committed to meeting its responsibilities to protect the environment wherever it operates and anticipates making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment. Devons unreimbursed expenditures in 2001 concerning such matters were immaterial, but Devon cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its future exposure concerning such matters. Investment Canada Act. The Investment Canada Act requires Government of Canada approval, in certain cases, of the acquisition of control of a Canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by Canadians. In certain circumstances, the acquisition of natural resource properties may be considered to be a transaction requiring such approval. INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS The oil and gas industry is subject to various types of regulation throughout the world. Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation, government agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas drilling and production activities, increase the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability. Inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, Devon is unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations. The following are significant areas of regulation. Exploration and Production. Devons oil and gas concessions and permits are granted by host governments and administered by various foreign government agencies. Such foreign governments require compliance with detailed regulations and orders which regulate, among other matters, drilling and operations on areas covered by concessions and permits and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments, taxes and minimum investments to the government. Regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells; implementing spill prevention plans; submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in 13 connection with drilling and production activities, surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production. Devons operations are also subject to regulations which may limit the number of wells or the locations at which Devon can drill. Environmental Regulations. Various government laws and regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of contaminants or otherwise relating to the protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment, affect Devons exploration, development, processing and production operations and the costs attendant thereto. In general, this consists of preparing Environmental Impact Assessments in order to receive required environmental permits to conduct drilling or construction activities. Such regulations also typically include requirements to develop emergency response plans, waste management plans, and spill contingency plans. In some countries, the application of worldwide standards, such as ISO 14000 governing Environmental Management Systems, are required to be implemented for international oil and gas operations. Brazil has stringent environmental laws. The basic federal law governing the environment is Law No. 9.605 of February 12, 1998, which set up areas of conservation that receive federal protection. The governmental environmental agency is IBAMA, which has significant enforcement powers. Environmental Impact Studies are required to determine the impact of activities on the environment and provide ways to avoid or diminish negative effects of the project on the environment. CONAMA Resolution 23 of December 7, 1994 established licensing criteria for activities related to drilling and production. Prior to commencement of exploration activities, IBAMA or a state environmental agency inspects the equipment to be used and must grant a license; the inspection and grant of the license may cause delays in start up of operations. In addition to federal regulations, state and local agencies may have additional jurisdiction. Damage to the environment results in strict liability to the holder of the Concession. Sanctions for violations can be civil, criminal and administrative in nature. GOVERNMENT TAKES AND TAXATION Foreign governments have been evaluating in recent years in and, in some cases, promulgating new rules and regulations regarding royalty payment obligations and taxes. In Brazil there are numerous taxes imposed by federal, state and municipal governments on services and equipment, which require extensive record keeping and withholdings. Among the most significant are the following: Law No. 9.779 of 1999 extended the tax for income legal entities earn with the rendering of services, technical assistance and administrative services to 25%. There is a Value Added Sales Tax (ICMS) ranging between 7% and 25% and a municipal service tax (ISS), typically paid in the place of performance, of about 5%. Excise tax (IPI) is paid on all goods manufactured or imported into Brazil that average about 10% (see exception for imports of equipment for petroleum activities above). There are "social contribution" taxes for funding Brazils extensive social welfare programs. COFINS, a social contribution tax charged on gross receipts, including financial and currency transactions and investments is 3%, and PIS, to fund the unemployment insurance program, is 14 financed by the employer at 0.65% of its gross monthly receipts. Additionally, there is a severance fund contribution (FGTS). A banking tax ("CPMF") on the debit of funds from an account is charges at 0.30%. In Argentina Competitiveness Law No. 25,413 amended by Law 25,453 created a new tax applicable on bank credits and debits. The tax is applicable on (1) credits and debits on current accounts in financial entities subject to the Financial Entities Law; (2) the operations carried out by financial entities subject to the Financial Entities Law where the person/entity ordering the financial operation or the beneficiaries do not use the current accounts mentioned above, and (3) the movement or handing over of funds (whether owned or belonging to third parties), by any person or entity. The General Tax Rate (subject to certain tax credits) is 0.6% in the case of debits and credits. In the cases described in points 2 and 3 above, it will be deemed that said financial operations replace the corresponding debits and credits and the tax rate will be doubled. GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATIONS AND FILINGS. Host country law and regulations in certain cases requires prior approval by the national government of any acquisition of concession and permits granting hydrocarbon rights and allowing petroleum operations to be conducted. In Argentina, Section 72 of Hydrocarbons Law 17,319 provides that permits and concessions granted under this law may be assigned with the prior authorization of the Government to assignees who meet the conditions required to be a concession holder. Such prior approval of the Government would be required if the permits and concessions held by Devon were transferred directly to a purchaser as assets. However, according to the past practice of the Secretariat of Energy, indirect transfers of permits and concessions by sale of the stock have not been subject to the prior approval of the Government. Subject to certain exemptions, Section 8 of Antitrust Law 25,156 as amended by Section 2 of National Executive Branch Decree No. 396/01, provides that the purchase of the property or any other right to shares or capital participations must be notified to the Comision Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia before execution or within a week after the transaction is closed, where the total volume of business of the participating companies exceeds US $200,000,000 in Argentina. EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2001, Devons staff consisted of 2,826 full time employees. The Company also engages independent consulting petroleum engineers, environmental professionals, geologists, geophysicists, landmen and attorneys on a fee basis. The Company believes that it has good labor relations with its employees. 15 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Substantially all of Devons properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage located in the Companys core operating areas. These interests entitle Devon to drill for and produce oil, natural gas and NGLs from specific areas. Devons interests are mostly in the form of working interests and volumetric production payments, and, to a lesser extent, overriding royalty, foreign government concessions, mineral and net profits interests and other forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties. PROVED RESERVES AND ESTIMATED FUTURE NET REVENUE "Proved reserves" are those quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs, which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. All reserve estimates were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with SEC definitions and guidelines (as described in the following notes). The following table sets forth Devons estimated proved reserves, the estimated future net revenues therefrom and the 10% Present Value thereof as of December 31, 2001. Approximately 67% of Devons U.S. proved reserves were estimated by LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. and Ryder Scott Company Petroleum Consultants, independent petroleum consultants. Devons internal staff of engineers estimated the remainder of the U.S. reserves. Approximately 43% of the year end 2001 Canadian proved reserves were calculated by the independent petroleum consultants of Paddock Lindstrom & Associates and Gilbert Laustsen Jung Associates, Ltd. The remaining percentage of Canadian reserves are based on Devons own estimates. The international proved reserves, other than Canada, were calculated by the independent petroleum consultants of Ryder Scott Company Petroleum Consultants. These estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the "Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Operations" in Note 16 to Devons Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, except that federal income taxes attributable to such future net revenues have been disregarded in the presentation below. 16 TOTAL PROVED PROVED PROVED DEVELOPED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES RESERVES (1) RESERVES (2) TOTAL RESERVES Oil (MMBbls)................................................ 586 324 262 Gas (Bcf)................................................... 5,477 3,948 1,529 NGL (MMBbls)................................................ 121 88 33 MMBoe (3)................................................... 1,620 1,070 550 Pre tax Future Net Revenue ($ millions)(4).................. 13,138 8,707 4,431 Pre tax 10% Present Value ($ millions)(4)................... 7,174 5,800 1,374 Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows ($ millions)(5)................................ 5,314 U.S. RESERVES Oil (MMBbls)................................................ 191 167 24 Gas (Bcf)................................................... 2,399 1,988 411 NGL (MMBbls)................................................ 52 48 4 MMBoe (3)................................................... 642 545 97 Pre tax Future Net Revenue ($ millions)(4).................. 5,294 4,663 631 Pre tax 10% Present Value ($ millions)(4)................... 3,270 2,952 318 Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows ($ millions)(5)................................ 2,801 CANADIAN RESERVES Oil (MMBbls)................................................ 166 124 42 Gas (Bcf)................................................... 2,625 1,923 702 NGL (MMBbls)................................................ 56 40 16 MMBoe (3)................................................... 659 485 174 Pre tax Future Net Revenue ($ millions)(4).................. 4,797 3,732 1,065 Pre tax 10% Present Value ($ millions)(4)................... 2,744 2,614 130 Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows ($ millions)(5)................................ 1,596 INTERNATIONAL RESERVES Oil (MMBbls)................................................ 229 33 196 Gas (Bcf)................................................... 453 37 416 NGL (MMBbls)................................................ 13 13 MMBoe (3)................................................... 319 40 279 Pre tax Future Net Revenue ($ millions)(4).................. 3,047 312 2,735 Pre tax 10% Present Value ($ millions)(4)................... 1,160 234 926 Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows ($ millions)(5)................................ 917 (1) Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. (2) Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompleting or deepening a well or for new fluid injection facilities. (3) Gas reserves are converted to MMBoe at the rate of six Mcf per Bbl of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of natural gas to oil, which rate is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of gas to oil prices. The respective prices of gas and oil are affected by market conditions and other factors in addition to relative energy content. 17 (4) Estimated future net revenue represents estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and development costs. The amounts shown do not give effect to non property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and future income tax expense or to depreciation, depletion and amortization. These amounts were calculated using prices and costs in effect as of December 31, 2001. These prices were not changed except where different prices were fixed and determinable from applicable contracts. These assumptions yield average prices over the life of Devons properties of $16.54 per Bbl of oil, $2.28 per Mcf of natural gas and $13.21 per Bbl of NGLs. These prices compare to December 31, 2001, New York Mercantile Exchange prices of $19.84 per Bbl for crude oil and of $2.65 per MMBtu for natural gas. (5) See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. No estimates of Devons proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of the last fiscal year except (i) in filings with the SEC and (ii) in filings with the Department of Energy ("DOE"). Reserve estimates filed by Devon with the SEC correspond with the estimates of Devon reserves contained herein. Reserve estimates filed with the DOE are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of Devons reserves included herein. However, the DOE requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that Devon operates and to exclude all interests in wells that Devon does not operate. The prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil, gas and NGL production subsequent to December 31, 2001. There can be no assurance that all of the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods indicated, that the assumed prices will be realized or that existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced. The process of estimating oil, gas and NGLs reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of, among other things, additional development activity, production history and viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur in the future. PRODUCTION, REVENUE AND PRICE HISTORY Certain information concerning oil and natural gas production, prices, revenues (net of all royalties, overriding royalties and other third party interests) and operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2001, is set forth in "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 18 WELL STATISTICS The following table sets forth Devons producing wells as of December 31, 2001: Oil Wells Gas Wells Total Wells Gross (1) Net (2) Gross (1) Net (2) Gross (1) Net (2) U.S. 8,610 4,054 9,224 4,591 17,834 8,645 Canada 6,999 3,205 6,998 4,038 13,997 7,243 International 1,393 397 75 25 1,468 422 Total 17,002 7,656 16,297 8,654 33,299 16,310 (1) Gross wells are the total number of wells in which Devon owns a working interest.

The operator supervises production, maintains production records, employs field personnel and performs other functions. The charges under operating agreements customarily vary with the depth and location of the well being operated. Devon is the operator of 16,478 of its wells. As operator, Devon receives reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of its duties as well as monthly per well producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area to or by unaffiliated third parties. In presenting its financial data, Devon records the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense, which is a common industry practice. ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE Devons properties are distributed geographically in five separate divisions. Operations in the United States are focused in the Permian/Mid Continent, the Rocky Mountain and Gulf divisions. Canadian operations are focused in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta and British Columbia. All operations outside North America make up Devons International division. Maintaining a tight geographic focus in selected core areas is a key element of Devons operating strategy. This concentration has allowed Devon to improve operating and capital efficiency. UNITED STATES PROPERTIES PERMIAN/MID CONTINENT DIVISION Devons Permian/Mid Continent Division includes portions of New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Mississippi and Louisiana. This area encompasses a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths. The Permian/Mid Continent produces more oil than any other division in the company and a significant portion of Devons natural gas. Devons Permian/Mid Continent production has historically come from conventional oil and gas properties. However, Devon recently established dominant positions in two non conventional gas plays in the Permian/Mid Continent: the Barnett Shale and the Cherokee coalbed methane project. The most significant asset brought to Devon in its January 24, 2002 acquisition of Mitchell Energy is the interest in the Barnett Shale of north Texas. The Barnett Shale is known as a "tight gas" formation. This means that in its natural state, the formation is resistant to the production of natural gas. Mitchell spent decades understanding how to efficiently develop and produce this gas. The resulting technology yielded a low risk and highly profitable natural gas play. Devon holds 525,000 net acres and over 800 producing wells in the Barnett Shale. Devons average working interest is approximately 95%. The Barnett Shale is a unique, unconventional gas resource that offers immediate low risk production growth and the potential for significant reserve additions. 20 The key to unlocking the gas trapped within the tight shale is a completion technique called light sand fracturing. Light sand fracturing yields much better results than earlier techniques and costs less. Not only are new wells fractured when completed, but older wells can be refractured with excellent results. Refractured wells often exceed their original flow rates, even after years of production. In spite of recent improvements in fracture technology Devon anticipates recovering less than 10% of the gas in place. Further technological improvements could unlock additional potential. In 2002, Devon plans to drill 300 new Barnett Shale wells and refracture 144 wells. The Company also plans to drill eight exploratory wells outside the core development area with the hope of expanding the productive area. The Barnett Shale is expected to be an important growth area for Devon for many years to come. The other important new asset in the Permian/Mid Continent Division is the Cherokee coalbed methane project. Coalbed methane is natural gas produced from underground coal deposits. Unlike conventional natural gas wells, coalbed methane wells initially produce water along with small quantities of gas. Over time, the water is removed from the reservoir releasing the gas trapped within the coal and gas production increases. During the first half of 2001, Devon acquired over 400,000 net acres within the Cherokee area of southeast Kansas and northeast Oklahoma. Devon began drilling in the second half of 2001 and had drilled 131 wells by the end of the year. Plans for 2002 are to drill 200 new wells and further refine completion techniques. Aggregate gas production should begin to reach significant levels in the second half of 2002 as drilling and de watering progress. If the wells in this project perform as Devon believes they will, the Company expects to ultimately drill more than 1,000 wells in the play. ROCKY MOUNTAIN DIVISION The Rocky Mountain Division includes Devons properties in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and northern New Mexico. While Devons assets in the Rocky Mountains include significant conventional oil and gas properties, 2002 activity is focused primarily on coalbed methane projects. The Rocky Mountain Division manages three of Devons four significant coalbed methane projects. The most active of these is in Wyomings Powder River Basin. Devon began drilling coalbed methane wells in the Powder River Basin in 1998. To date, Devon has drilled almost 1,400 wells. Devon exited 2001 with net Powder River coalbed methane sales at about 90 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. This rate is expected to continue to rise as more wells are drilled and de watered. Plans call for drilling more than 200 Powder River wells in 2002. This will include 21 roughly 170 wells in existing producing areas and 90 wells in new project areas. Current production is primarily from the Wyodak coal formation. In addition, the Company has several new projects developing the deeper Big George coals. Success in the Big George would significantly expand the potential of Devons 250,000 net acres in this area. GULF DIVISION The Gulf Division manages Devons properties in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in south Texas and south Louisiana. The division contributes roughly 17% of current company wide gas production, mostly from the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The shallow water Gulf, or "shelf," is a mature producing area with relatively high field decline rates. These characteristics present challenges to Gulf operators. Devon has responded to those challenges by continually utilizing technological advances in the search for new reserves. Devon is applying four component seismic technology to identify prospects on large tracts of its shelf acreage. Traditional seismic techniques have not been useful in imaging reservoirs lying below shallow gas reservoirs and salt deposits. Four component seismic, or 4C, is now allowing Devons geoscientists to more accurately picture these unexplored formations. Devon has conducted two large 4C seismic surveys offshore Louisiana. In early 2002, Devon began drilling and has achieved early success on prospects resulting from a 300 square mile 4C survey in the West Cameron area. Devon is currently interpreting the results of its second 4C survey. This one covers 360 square miles in the Eugene Island South Marsh Island area. Another response to declining shelf production has been the move into deeper water. The deepwater Gulf is believed to contain some of the largest remaining undiscovered oil and gas reserves in North America. Because deepwater exploration is capital intensive, Devons strategy is to move cautiously. Devons main focus is on prospects in water depths for which infrastructure and production technology are well established. Devon limits its exploration exposure in the deepwater to participation in a few wells each year. Furthermore, Devon generally shares the risk of deepwater exploration wells with industry partners. One of the deepwater exploration wells Devon plans to drill in 2002 will assess one of the largest untested structures in the Gulf. The Cortes Prospect lies in 3,300 of water and covers most of four 5,000 acre blocks in the Port Isabel area. Devon has a 25% working interest in Cortes. Another of Devons deepwater projects is expected to begin producing in 2002. Devon has a 48% working interest in the Manatee Field which is located on Green Canyon block 155 in about 1,900 of water. Production will be from two wells in a sub sea system. These wells will produce into the nearby Angus Field and then flow to the Bullwinkle platform in 1,350 of water. A further source of oil and gas reserves and production growth lies in the Gulf Coast region onshore South Texas. Devons activities in this area have focused on exploration in the Edwards, Wilcox and Frio/Vicksberg trends. In 2001 Devon drilled five successful exploration 22 wells and 32 development wells. As a result, over the course of the year Devons share of production doubled to more than 60 million cubic feet per day. The Mitchell acquisition, completed in early 2002, adds additional production and undeveloped acreage in the South Texas area. With a large, high quality inventory of additional drilling locations, we expect South Texas to be a source of continued growth. CANADA Devons acquisition of Anderson Exploration in late 2001 dramatically increased the significance of Canada to Devons overall property portfolio and enhanced our growth potential. Devon sought to expand its presence in Canada because it believes that many of its oil and gas prone areas are underdeveloped or underexplored. Devons properties in Canada offer a balance of drilling opportunities spanning the entire risk reward spectrum. The Anderson acquisition strengthened Devons holdings in almost all of the important producing basins in Canada. One such area is the Deep Basin located in western Alberta, along the border with British Columbia. Devon had sought for years to obtain a significant acreage position in the Deep Basin. However, other operators, including Anderson, already controlled most of the acreage. As a result of the acquisition, Devon now holds over 800,000 net acres in the Deep Basin. Furthermore, the profitability of Devons operations is enhanced by ownership in nine major gas processing plants in the area. During 2002, Devon plans to drill about 85 wells in the Deep Basin. These reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids, producing up to 100 barrels with each million cubic feet of gas. Due to the multizone nature of this area, drilling success rates are quite high, in the 70% to 90% range. Another focus area for Devons 2002 drilling program will be the Slave Point region of northwestern Alberta and northeastern British Columbia. This area includes the Hamburg/Ladyfern area where some of Canadas largest recent gas discoveries have occurred. Devon plans to drill eight Slave Point wells in 2002, including five at Ladyfern. Near the end of 2002, Devon plans to bring several previous deep gas discoveries on stream in the Grizzly Valley area of the Foothills of northeastern British Columbia. Since its initial discovery here in 1998, Devon has drilled 11 successful wells. Devon expects to commence initial production at a combined rate of about 50 million cubic feet of gas per day to Devon. The Anderson acquisition significantly increased Devons holdings in the Foothills. Devon has interests ranging from 49% to 55% in over 1.2 million gross acres in the area. While Devon had focused on exploring for deep gas reservoirs in this area, Anderson had achieved considerable success in drilling for shallower formations. The Anderson acquisition affords the Company the opportunity to extend Andersons shallow gas development onto Devons acreage and to apply Devons deep gas exploration expertise to the Anderson acreage. One of the highest potential exploration assets Devon acquired from Anderson was its 1.5 23 million net acres in Canadas most prospective exploratory region, the far north. Devons position includes a working interest in nearly half of all the lands held by the industry in the Mackenzie Delta and shallow water Beaufort Sea. Devon plans to continue the long term exploration program begun by Anderson. These plans include active 2D and 3D seismic programs both onshore and offshore. Beginning in 2002, Devon plans to drill up to four wells annually in the Mackenzie Delta. While it will be years before construction of a pipeline will allow production to begin, this area could hold significant long term potential for Devon. INTERNATIONAL Devons assets outside North America were acquired in the PennzEnergy and Santa Fe transactions. Since acquiring these properties, Devon has critically evaluated each one and has disposed of many. Devon has identified our assets in Argentina and Indonesia for sale in 2002 as part of our non core asset dispositions. From interests in 13 countries, Devon now is focusing on just three international areas. In Azerbaijan, Devon holds a 5.6% carried interest in a world class oil development project, the Azeri Chirag Gunashli Field. Significant production from this multi billion barrel oilfield is still several years away pending completion of an additional export pipeline. In China, Devon is the largest acreage holder in the Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South China Sea. Development of our Panyu Project is underway and Devon expects first oil production from two offshore platforms in late 2003. Devon expects its share of production to approximate 15,000 barrels per day. Devons international exploration efforts are focused primarily on the deepwater off West Africa. Devon holds over two million net acres in these waters where several important discoveries have been made by the industry in recent years. In 2002, Devon plans to drill a test well on our Rita Prospect located offshore Congo.

Devon believes that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business. As is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties, little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition (other than a preliminary review of local records). Investigations, generally including a title opinion of outside counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Royalty Matters Numerous gas producers and related parties, including Devon, have been named in various lawsuits filed by private litigants alleging violation of the federal False Claims Act. The suits allege 25 that the producers and related parties used below market prices, improper deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and sold from federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. The various suits have been consolidated by the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for pre trial proceedings in the matter of In re Natural Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litigation, MDL 1293, United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. Devon believes that it has acted reasonably, has legitimate and strong defenses to all allegations in the suits, and has paid royalties in good faith. Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with these lawsuits and no liability has been recorded in connection therewith. Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings incidental to its business. However, to Devons knowledge as of the date of this report, there were no other material pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which any of its property is subject. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2001. 26 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS MARKET PRICE Devons common stock has been traded on the American Stock Exchange (the "AMEX") since September 29, 1988. Prior to September 29, 1988, Devons common stock was privately held. Commencing on December 15, 1998, a new class of Devon exchangeable shares began trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSE") under the symbol NSX. These shares are essentially equivalent to Devon common stock. However, because they are issued by Devons wholly owned subsidiary, Northstar, they qualify as a domestic Canadian investment for Canadian institutional shareholders. They are exchangeable at any time, on a one for one basis, for common shares of Devon at the holders option. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for Devon common stock and exchangeable shares as reported by the AMEX and TSE for the periods indicated.

Effective December 31, 1996, Devon increased its quarterly dividend payment to $0.05 per share. Devon anticipates continuing to pay regular quarterly dividends in the foreseeable future. Dividends are also paid on the exchangeable shares at the same rate and on the same dates as dividends paid on the common stock. On March 14, 2002, there were 30,431 holders of record of Devon common stock and 298 holders of record for the exchangeable shares. 27 ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The following selected financial information (not covered by the independent auditors reports) should be read in conjunction with "Item 7.

The dividends per share are also based on the number of shares outstanding in each year assuming the Santa Fe Snyder merger and the Northstar combination had been consummated as of the beginning of the earliest year presented. Santa Fe Snyder did not pay any dividends in any of the years presented. Northstar did not pay any dividends in 1997, or in 1998 prior to the closing of the Northstar combination. Because of these facts, the cash dividends per share presented for 1997 through 2000 are not representative of the actual amounts paid by Devon on an historical basis. For the years 1997 through 2000, Devons historical cash dividends per share were $0.20 in each year. (2) For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends, (i) earnings consist of earnings before income taxes, plus fixed charges; (ii) fixed charges consist of interest expense, distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trust, amortization of costs relating to indebtedness and the preferred securities of subsidiary trust, and one third of rental expense estimated to be attributable to interest; and (iii) preferred stock dividends consist of the amount of pre tax earnings required to pay dividends on the outstanding preferred stock. For the years 1999, 1998 and 1997, earnings were insufficient to cover combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends by $205 million, $362 million and $346 million, respectively. (3) Modified EBITDA represents earnings before interest (including effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, change in fair value of financial instruments, and distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trust), taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization and reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties. (4) "Cash margin" equals total revenues less cash expenses. Cash expenses are all expenses other than the non cash expenses of depreciation, depletion and amortization, effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, change in fair value of financial instruments, reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties and 29 deferred income tax expense (benefit). Cash margin measures the net cash which is generated by a companys operations during a given period, without regard to the period such cash is actually physically received or spent by the company. This margin ignores the non operational effect on a companys "net cash provided by operating activities", as measured by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, from a companys activities as an operator of oil and gas wells. Such activities produce net increases or decreases in temporary cash funds held by the operator which have no effect on net earnings of the company. (5) Modified EBITDA is presented because it is commonly accepted in the oil and gas industry as a financial indicator of a companys ability to service or incur debt. Cash margin is presented because it is commonly accepted in the oil and gas industry as a financial indicator of a companys ability to fund capital expenditures or service debt. Modified EBITDA and cash margin are also presented because investors routinely request such information. Management interprets the trends of modified EBITDA and cash margin in a similar manner as trends in net earnings. Modified EBITDA and cash margin should be used as supplements to, and not as substitutes for, net earnings and net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as measures of Devons profitability or liquidity. There may be operational or financial demands and requirements that reduce managements discretion over the use of modified EBITDA and cash margin. See "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Modified EBITDA and cash margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. (6) Gas volumes are converted to Boe or MMBoe at the rate of six Mcf of gas per barrel of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of natural gas and oil, which rate is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of oil and gas prices. The respective prices of oil, gas and NGLs are affected by market and other factors in addition to relative energy content. 30 ITEM 7.

The operator supervises production, maintains production records, employs field personnel and performs other functions. The charges under operating agreements customarily vary with the depth and location of the well being operated. Devon is the operator of 16,478 of its wells. As operator, Devon receives reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of its duties as well as monthly per well producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area to or by unaffiliated third parties. In presenting its financial data, Devon records the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense, which is a common industry practice. ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE Devons properties are distributed geographically in five separate divisions. Operations in the United States are focused in the Permian/Mid Continent, the Rocky Mountain and Gulf divisions. Canadian operations are focused in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta and British Columbia. All operations outside North America make up Devons International division. Maintaining a tight geographic focus in selected core areas is a key element of Devons operating strategy. This concentration has allowed Devon to improve operating and capital efficiency. UNITED STATES PROPERTIES PERMIAN/MID CONTINENT DIVISION Devons Permian/Mid Continent Division includes portions of New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Mississippi and Louisiana. This area encompasses a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths. The Permian/Mid Continent produces more oil than any other division in the company and a significant portion of Devons natural gas. Devons Permian/Mid Continent production has historically come from conventional oil and gas properties. However, Devon recently established dominant positions in two non conventional gas plays in the Permian/Mid Continent: the Barnett Shale and the Cherokee coalbed methane project. The most significant asset brought to Devon in its January 24, 2002 acquisition of Mitchell Energy is the interest in the Barnett Shale of north Texas. The Barnett Shale is known as a "tight gas" formation. This means that in its natural state, the formation is resistant to the production of natural gas. Mitchell spent decades understanding how to efficiently develop and produce this gas. The resulting technology yielded a low risk and highly profitable natural gas play. Devon holds 525,000 net acres and over 800 producing wells in the Barnett Shale. Devons average working interest is approximately 95%. The Barnett Shale is a unique, unconventional gas resource that offers immediate low risk production growth and the potential for significant reserve additions. 20 The key to unlocking the gas trapped within the tight shale is a completion technique called light sand fracturing. Light sand fracturing yields much better results than earlier techniques and costs less. Not only are new wells fractured when completed, but older wells can be refractured with excellent results. Refractured wells often exceed their original flow rates, even after years of production. In spite of recent improvements in fracture technology Devon anticipates recovering less than 10% of the gas in place. Further technological improvements could unlock additional potential. In 2002, Devon plans to drill 300 new Barnett Shale wells and refracture 144 wells. The Company also plans to drill eight exploratory wells outside the core development area with the hope of expanding the productive area. The Barnett Shale is expected to be an important growth area for Devon for many years to come. The other important new asset in the Permian/Mid Continent Division is the Cherokee coalbed methane project. Coalbed methane is natural gas produced from underground coal deposits. Unlike conventional natural gas wells, coalbed methane wells initially produce water along with small quantities of gas. Over time, the water is removed from the reservoir releasing the gas trapped within the coal and gas production increases. During the first half of 2001, Devon acquired over 400,000 net acres within the Cherokee area of southeast Kansas and northeast Oklahoma. Devon began drilling in the second half of 2001 and had drilled 131 wells by the end of the year. Plans for 2002 are to drill 200 new wells and further refine completion techniques. Aggregate gas production should begin to reach significant levels in the second half of 2002 as drilling and de watering progress. If the wells in this project perform as Devon believes they will, the Company expects to ultimately drill more than 1,000 wells in the play. ROCKY MOUNTAIN DIVISION The Rocky Mountain Division includes Devons properties in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and northern New Mexico. While Devons assets in the Rocky Mountains include significant conventional oil and gas properties, 2002 activity is focused primarily on coalbed methane projects. The Rocky Mountain Division manages three of Devons four significant coalbed methane projects. The most active of these is in Wyomings Powder River Basin. Devon began drilling coalbed methane wells in the Powder River Basin in 1998. To date, Devon has drilled almost 1,400 wells. Devon exited 2001 with net Powder River coalbed methane sales at about 90 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. This rate is expected to continue to rise as more wells are drilled and de watered. Plans call for drilling more than 200 Powder River wells in 2002. This will include 21 roughly 170 wells in existing producing areas and 90 wells in new project areas. Current production is primarily from the Wyodak coal formation. In addition, the Company has several new projects developing the deeper Big George coals. Success in the Big George would significantly expand the potential of Devons 250,000 net acres in this area. GULF DIVISION The Gulf Division manages Devons properties in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in south Texas and south Louisiana. The division contributes roughly 17% of current company wide gas production, mostly from the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The shallow water Gulf, or "shelf," is a mature producing area with relatively high field decline rates. These characteristics present challenges to Gulf operators. Devon has responded to those challenges by continually utilizing technological advances in the search for new reserves. Devon is applying four component seismic technology to identify prospects on large tracts of its shelf acreage. Traditional seismic techniques have not been useful in imaging reservoirs lying below shallow gas reservoirs and salt deposits. Four component seismic, or 4C, is now allowing Devons geoscientists to more accurately picture these unexplored formations. Devon has conducted two large 4C seismic surveys offshore Louisiana. In early 2002, Devon began drilling and has achieved early success on prospects resulting from a 300 square mile 4C survey in the West Cameron area. Devon is currently interpreting the results of its second 4C survey. This one covers 360 square miles in the Eugene Island South Marsh Island area. Another response to declining shelf production has been the move into deeper water. The deepwater Gulf is believed to contain some of the largest remaining undiscovered oil and gas reserves in North America. Because deepwater exploration is capital intensive, Devons strategy is to move cautiously. Devons main focus is on prospects in water depths for which infrastructure and production technology are well established. Devon limits its exploration exposure in the deepwater to participation in a few wells each year. Furthermore, Devon generally shares the risk of deepwater exploration wells with industry partners. One of the deepwater exploration wells Devon plans to drill in 2002 will assess one of the largest untested structures in the Gulf. The Cortes Prospect lies in 3,300 of water and covers most of four 5,000 acre blocks in the Port Isabel area. Devon has a 25% working interest in Cortes. Another of Devons deepwater projects is expected to begin producing in 2002. Devon has a 48% working interest in the Manatee Field which is located on Green Canyon block 155 in about 1,900 of water. Production will be from two wells in a sub sea system. These wells will produce into the nearby Angus Field and then flow to the Bullwinkle platform in 1,350 of water. A further source of oil and gas reserves and production growth lies in the Gulf Coast region onshore South Texas. Devons activities in this area have focused on exploration in the Edwards, Wilcox and Frio/Vicksberg trends. In 2001 Devon drilled five successful exploration 22 wells and 32 development wells. As a result, over the course of the year Devons share of production doubled to more than 60 million cubic feet per day. The Mitchell acquisition, completed in early 2002, adds additional production and undeveloped acreage in the South Texas area. With a large, high quality inventory of additional drilling locations, we expect South Texas to be a source of continued growth. CANADA Devons acquisition of Anderson Exploration in late 2001 dramatically increased the significance of Canada to Devons overall property portfolio and enhanced our growth potential. Devon sought to expand its presence in Canada because it believes that many of its oil and gas prone areas are underdeveloped or underexplored. Devons properties in Canada offer a balance of drilling opportunities spanning the entire risk reward spectrum. The Anderson acquisition strengthened Devons holdings in almost all of the important producing basins in Canada. One such area is the Deep Basin located in western Alberta, along the border with British Columbia. Devon had sought for years to obtain a significant acreage position in the Deep Basin. However, other operators, including Anderson, already controlled most of the acreage. As a result of the acquisition, Devon now holds over 800,000 net acres in the Deep Basin. Furthermore, the profitability of Devons operations is enhanced by ownership in nine major gas processing plants in the area. During 2002, Devon plans to drill about 85 wells in the Deep Basin. These reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids, producing up to 100 barrels with each million cubic feet of gas. Due to the multizone nature of this area, drilling success rates are quite high, in the 70% to 90% range. Another focus area for Devons 2002 drilling program will be the Slave Point region of northwestern Alberta and northeastern British Columbia. This area includes the Hamburg/Ladyfern area where some of Canadas largest recent gas discoveries have occurred. Devon plans to drill eight Slave Point wells in 2002, including five at Ladyfern. Near the end of 2002, Devon plans to bring several previous deep gas discoveries on stream in the Grizzly Valley area of the Foothills of northeastern British Columbia. Since its initial discovery here in 1998, Devon has drilled 11 successful wells. Devon expects to commence initial production at a combined rate of about 50 million cubic feet of gas per day to Devon. The Anderson acquisition significantly increased Devons holdings in the Foothills. Devon has interests ranging from 49% to 55% in over 1.2 million gross acres in the area. While Devon had focused on exploring for deep gas reservoirs in this area, Anderson had achieved considerable success in drilling for shallower formations. The Anderson acquisition affords the Company the opportunity to extend Andersons shallow gas development onto Devons acreage and to apply Devons deep gas exploration expertise to the Anderson acreage. One of the highest potential exploration assets Devon acquired from Anderson was its 1.5 23 million net acres in Canadas most prospective exploratory region, the far north. Devons position includes a working interest in nearly half of all the lands held by the industry in the Mackenzie Delta and shallow water Beaufort Sea. Devon plans to continue the long term exploration program begun by Anderson. These plans include active 2D and 3D seismic programs both onshore and offshore. Beginning in 2002, Devon plans to drill up to four wells annually in the Mackenzie Delta. While it will be years before construction of a pipeline will allow production to begin, this area could hold significant long term potential for Devon. INTERNATIONAL Devons assets outside North America were acquired in the PennzEnergy and Santa Fe transactions. Since acquiring these properties, Devon has critically evaluated each one and has disposed of many. Devon has identified our assets in Argentina and Indonesia for sale in 2002 as part of our non core asset dispositions. From interests in 13 countries, Devon now is focusing on just three international areas. In Azerbaijan, Devon holds a 5.6% carried interest in a world class oil development project, the Azeri Chirag Gunashli Field. Significant production from this multi billion barrel oilfield is still several years away pending completion of an additional export pipeline. In China, Devon is the largest acreage holder in the Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South China Sea. Development of our Panyu Project is underway and Devon expects first oil production from two offshore platforms in late 2003. Devon expects its share of production to approximate 15,000 barrels per day. Devons international exploration efforts are focused primarily on the deepwater off West Africa. Devon holds over two million net acres in these waters where several important discoveries have been made by the industry in recent years. In 2002, Devon plans to drill a test well on our Rita Prospect located offshore Congo.

Devon believes that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business. As is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties, little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition (other than a preliminary review of local records). Investigations, generally including a title opinion of outside counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Royalty Matters Numerous gas producers and related parties, including Devon, have been named in various lawsuits filed by private litigants alleging violation of the federal False Claims Act. The suits allege 25 that the producers and related parties used below market prices, improper deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and sold from federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. The various suits have been consolidated by the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for pre trial proceedings in the matter of In re Natural Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litigation, MDL 1293, United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. Devon believes that it has acted reasonably, has legitimate and strong defenses to all allegations in the suits, and has paid royalties in good faith. Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with these lawsuits and no liability has been recorded in connection therewith. Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings incidental to its business. However, to Devons knowledge as of the date of this report, there were no other material pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which any of its property is subject. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2001. 26 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS MARKET PRICE Devons common stock has been traded on the American Stock Exchange (the "AMEX") since September 29, 1988. Prior to September 29, 1988, Devons common stock was privately held. Commencing on December 15, 1998, a new class of Devon exchangeable shares began trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSE") under the symbol NSX. These shares are essentially equivalent to Devon common stock. However, because they are issued by Devons wholly owned subsidiary, Northstar, they qualify as a domestic Canadian investment for Canadian institutional shareholders.

The dividends per share are also based on the number of shares outstanding in each year assuming the Santa Fe Snyder merger and the Northstar combination had been consummated as of the beginning of the earliest year presented. Santa Fe Snyder did not pay any dividends in any of the years presented. Northstar did not pay any dividends in 1997, or in 1998 prior to the closing of the Northstar combination. Because of these facts, the cash dividends per share presented for 1997 through 2000 are not representative of the actual amounts paid by Devon on an historical basis. For the years 1997 through 2000, Devons historical cash dividends per share were $0.20 in each year. (2) For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends, (i) earnings consist of earnings before income taxes, plus fixed charges; (ii) fixed charges consist of interest expense, distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trust, amortization of costs relating to indebtedness and the preferred securities of subsidiary trust, and one third of rental expense estimated to be attributable to interest; and (iii) preferred stock dividends consist of the amount of pre tax earnings required to pay dividends on the outstanding preferred stock. For the years 1999, 1998 and 1997, earnings were insufficient to cover combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends by $205 million, $362 million and $346 million, respectively. (3) Modified EBITDA represents earnings before interest (including effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, change in fair value of financial instruments, and distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trust), taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization and reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties. (4) "Cash margin" equals total revenues less cash expenses. Cash expenses are all expenses other than the non cash expenses of depreciation, depletion and amortization, effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, change in fair value of financial instruments, reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties and 29 deferred income tax expense (benefit). Cash margin measures the net cash which is generated by a companys operations during a given period, without regard to the period such cash is actually physically received or spent by the company. This margin ignores the non operational effect on a companys "net cash provided by operating activities", as measured by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, from a companys activities as an operator of oil and gas wells. Such activities produce net increases or decreases in temporary cash funds held by the operator which have no effect on net earnings of the company. (5) Modified EBITDA is presented because it is commonly accepted in the oil and gas industry as a financial indicator of a companys ability to service or incur debt. Cash margin is presented because it is commonly accepted in the oil and gas industry as a financial indicator of a companys ability to fund capital expenditures or service debt. Modified EBITDA and cash margin are also presented because investors routinely request such information. Management interprets the trends of modified EBITDA and cash margin in a similar manner as trends in net earnings. Modified EBITDA and cash margin should be used as supplements to, and not as substitutes for, net earnings and net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as measures of Devons profitability or liquidity. There may be operational or financial demands and requirements that reduce managements discretion over the use of modified EBITDA and cash margin. See "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Modified EBITDA and cash margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. (6) Gas volumes are converted to Boe or MMBoe at the rate of six Mcf of gas per barrel of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of natural gas and oil, which rate is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of oil and gas prices. The respective prices of oil, gas and NGLs are affected by market and other factors in addition to relative energy content. 30 ITEM 7.
