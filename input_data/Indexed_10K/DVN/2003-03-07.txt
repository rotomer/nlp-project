BUSINESS GENERAL Devon Energy Corporation, including its subsidiaries, ("Devon" or the "Company") is an independent energy company engaged primarily in oil and gas exploration, development and production, the acquisition of producing properties, the transportation of oil, gas, and NGLs and the processing of natural gas. Through its predecessors, Devon began operations in 1971 as a privately held company. In 1988, the Companys common stock began trading publicly on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol "DVN". In addition, commencing on December 15, 1998, a new class of Devon exchangeable shares began trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol "NSX". These shares are essentially equivalent to Devon common stock. However, because they are issued by Devons wholly owned subsidiary, Northstar Energy Corporation ("Northstar"), they qualify as a domestic Canadian investment for Canadian shareholders. They are exchangeable at any time, on a one for one basis, for common shares of Devon. The principal and administrative offices of Devon are located at 20 North Broadway, Oklahoma City, OK 73102 8260 (telephone 405/235 3611). Devon operates oil and gas properties in the United States, Canada and internationally. Devons North American properties are concentrated within five geographic areas. Operations in the United States are focused in the Permian Basin, the Mid Continent, the Rocky Mountains and onshore and offshore Gulf Coast. Canadian operations are focused in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta and British Columbia. Operations outside North America currently include Azerbaijan, Brazil, China and West Africa. In addition to its oil and gas operations, Devon has a large marketing and midstream business. This includes marketing natural gas, crude oil and NGLs. Marketing and midstream also includes the construction and operation of pipelines, storage and treating facilities and gas processing plants. (A detailed description of Devons significant properties and associated 2002 developments can be found under "Item 2. Properties beginning on page 13 hereof). At December 31, 2002, Devons estimated proved reserves were 1,609 MMBoe, of which 60% were natural gas reserves and 40% were oil and NGLs reserves. The present value of pre tax future net revenues discounted at 10% per annum assuming essentially constant prices ("10% Present Value") of such reserves was $15.3 billion. After taxes, the present value was $10.4 billion. Devon is one of the top five public independent oil and gas companies based in the United States, as measured by oil and gas reserves. AVAILABILITY OF REPORTS Devon makes available free of charge on its internet website, www.dvn.com, its Annual Report on Form 10 K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q, Current Reports on Form 8 K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files or furnishes them to the Securities Exchange Commission. STRATEGY Devons primary objectives are to build reserves, production, cash flow and earnings per share by (a) acquiring oil and gas properties, (b) exploring for new oil and gas reserves and (c) optimizing production and value from existing oil and gas properties. Devons management seeks to achieve these objectives by (a) concentrating its properties in core areas to achieve economies of scale, (b) acquiring and developing high profit margin properties, (c) continually disposing of marginal and non strategic properties, (d) balancing reserves between oil and gas, (e) maintaining a high degree of financial flexibility, and (f) enhancing the value of Devons production through marketing and midstream activities. 5 During 1988, Devon expanded its capital base with its first issuance of common stock to the public. This transaction began a substantial expansion program that has continued through the subsequent years. Devon has used a two pronged strategy of acquiring producing properties and engaging in drilling activities to achieve this expansion. Total proved reserves increased from 8 MMBoe at year end 1987 (without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 mergers accounted for as poolings of interests) to 1,609 MMBoe at year end 2002. Devons objective, however, is to increase value per share, not simply to increase total assets. Proved reserves have grown from 1.31 Boe per share at year end 1987 (without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 poolings) to 10.03 Boe per share at year end 2002. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 14.5%. Another measure of value per share is oil and gas production per share. Production increased from 0.18 Boe per share in 1987 (without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 poolings) to 1.17 Boe per share in 2002, a compound annual growth rate of 13.3%. DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS On February 24, 2003, Devon and Ocean Energy Inc. ("Ocean") announced their intention to merge. In the transaction, Devon will issue 0.414 of a share of its common stock for each outstanding share of Ocean common stock. Also, Devon will assume approximately $1.8 billion of debt from Ocean. The transaction is subject to approval by the stockholders of both companies, as well as certain regulatory approvals. If approved, the transaction is expected to be consummated shortly after the stockholder meetings. On January 24, 2002, Devon completed its acquisition of Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. ("Mitchell"). Under the terms of this merger, Devon issued approximately 30 million shares of Devon common stock and paid $1.6 billion in cash to the Mitchell stockholders. The cash portion of the acquisition was funded from borrowings under a $3.0 billion senior unsecured term loan credit facility. The Mitchell merger added approximately 404 million Boe to Devons proved reserves. Following the Mitchell merger announcement in August 2001, Devon announced on September 4, 2001, that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Anderson Exploration Ltd. ("Anderson") for approximately $3.5 billion in cash. This acquisition closed on October 15, 2001, and therefore had an impact on Devons results for the last two and one half months of 2001. The Anderson acquisition added approximately 534 million Boe to Devons proved reserves. To fund the cash portions of these two acquisitions, as well as to pay related transaction costs and retire certain long term debt assumed from Mitchell and Anderson, Devon entered into long term debt agreements in October 2001 that totaled $6 billion. Half of this total consisted of $3 billion of notes and debentures issued on October 3, 2001. Of this total, $1.25 billion bears interest at 7.875% and matures in September 2031. The remaining $1.75 billion bears interest at 6.875% and matures in September 2011. The remaining $3 billion of the $6 billion of long term debt is in the form of a credit facility that bears interest at floating rates. As of December 31, 2002, $1.9 billion of the original $3 billion balance had been retired. The primary sources of the repayments were the 2002 issuance of $1 billion of debt securities, of which $0.8 billion was used to pay down debt, and $1.4 billion from the sale of certain oil and gas properties, of which $1.1 billion was used to pay down debt. As of December 31, 2002, the balance outstanding under the term loan credit facility was $1.1 billion at an average rate of 2.5%. Principal payments due on this debt are $0.3 billion in April 2006 and $0.8 billion in October 2006. During 2002, Devon disposed of approximately $1.4 billion of properties. Also in 2002, Devon spent $1.5 billion in its exploration and drilling efforts. See further discussion of Devons 2002 exploration and drilling efforts in "Item 2. Properties." FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report contains information on Devons segments and geographical areas. 6 DRILLING ACTIVITIES Devon is engaged in numerous drilling activities on properties presently owned and intends to drill or develop other properties acquired in the future. Devons 2003 drilling activities will be focused in the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Mid Continent, Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast areas in the U.S., the Western Sedimentary basin of Canada and in China and West Africa outside North America. The following tables set forth the results of Devons drilling activity for the past five years.

(2) Net wells are the sum of Devons working interests in gross wells. As of December 31, 2002, Devon was participating in the drilling of 76 gross (60.71 net) wells in the U.S., 49 gross (28.93 net) wells in Canada and 8 gross (0.89 net) wells internationally. Of these wells, through February 15, 2003, 51 gross (40.91 net) wells in the U.S. and 42 gross (25.07 net) wells in Canada had been completed as productive. An additional 1 gross (.30 net) well in the U.S., 1 gross (.50 net) well in Canada and 1 gross (0.50 net) well internationally were dry holes. The remaining wells were still in process. CUSTOMERS Devon sells its gas production to a variety of customers including pipelines, utilities, gas marketing firms, industrial users and local distribution companies. Existing gathering systems and interstate and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas sales and deliveries. The principal customers for Devons crude oil production are refiners, remarketers and other companies, some of which have pipeline facilities near the producing properties. In the event pipeline facilities are not conveniently available, crude oil is trucked or barged to storage, refining or pipeline facilities. No purchaser accounted for over 10% of Devons revenues in 2002. OIL AND NATURAL GAS MARKETING Oil Marketing. Devons oil production is sold under both long term (one year or more) and short term (less than one year) agreements at prices negotiated with third parties Natural Gas Marketing. Devons gas production is also sold under both long term and short term agreements at prices negotiated with third parties. Although exact percentages vary daily, as of February 2003 approximately 75% of Devons natural gas production was sold under short term contracts at variable or market sensitive prices. These market sensitive sales are referred to as "spot market" sales. Another 22% were committed under various long term contracts (one year or more) which dedicate the natural gas to a purchaser for an extended period of time, but still at market sensitive prices. Devons remaining gas production was sold under fixed price contracts: 2% under short term agreements and 1% under long term contracts. Under both long term and short term contracts, typically either the entire contract (in the case of short term contracts) or the price provisions of the contract (in the case of long term contracts) are re negotiated from daily intervals up to one year intervals. The spot market has become progressively more competitive in recent years. As a result, prices on the spot market have been volatile. The spot market is subject to volatility as supply and demand factors in various regions of North America fluctuate. In addition to fixed price contracts, Devon periodically enters into hedging arrangements or firm delivery commitments with a portion of its gas production. These activities are intended to support targeted gas price levels and to manage the Companys exposure to gas price fluctuations. (See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.") COMPETITION The oil and gas business is highly competitive. Devon encounters competition by major integrated and independent oil and gas companies in acquiring drilling prospects and properties, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Intense competition occurs with respect to marketing, particularly of natural gas. Certain competitors have resources that substantially exceed those of Devon. 8 SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, pipelines, utilities, local distribution companies and industrial users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. GOVERNMENT REGULATION Devons operations are subject to various levels of government controls and regulations in the United States, Canada and internationally. UNITED STATES REGULATION In the United States, legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation, numerous federal, state and local departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas drilling, gas processing plants and production activities, increase the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability. Inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, Devon is unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations. Devon considers the cost of environmental protection a necessary and manageable part of its business. Devon has been able to plan for and comply with new environmental initiatives without materially altering its operating strategies. Exploration and Production. Devons United States operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells; implementing spill prevention plans; submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities, surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production. Devons operations are also subject to various conservation matters, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases, which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally limit the venting or flaring of gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and gas Devon can produce from its wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which Devon can drill. Certain of Devons oil and gas leases, including its offshore Gulf of Mexico leases, most of its leases in the San Juan Basin and many of Devons leases in southeast New Mexico and Wyoming, are granted by the federal government and administered by various federal agencies, including the Minerals Management Service of the Department of the Interior ("MMS"). Such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders which regulate, among other matters, drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases, and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government. The MMS has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and, in some cases, promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") also has jurisdiction over certain offshore activities pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. 9 Environmental and Occupational Regulations. Various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of contaminants or otherwise relating to the protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment, affect Devons exploration, development, processing, and production operations and the costs attendant thereto. These laws and regulations increase Devons overall operating expenses. Devon maintains levels of insurance customary in the industry to limit its financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and accidental discharges of oil, salt water or other substances. However, 100% coverage is not maintained concerning any environmental claim, and no coverage is maintained with respect to any penalty or fine required to be paid by Devon because of its violation of any federal, state or local law. Devon is committed to meeting its responsibilities to protect the environment wherever it operates and anticipates making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment. Devons unreimbursed expenditures in 2002 concerning such matters were immaterial, but Devon cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its future exposure concerning such matters. Devon is also subject to laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health. Due to the continued changes in these laws and regulations, and the judicial construction of same, Devon is unable to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its future costs of complying with these laws and regulations. Devon considers the cost of safety and health compliance a necessary and manageable part of its business. Devon has been able to plan for and comply with new initiatives without materially altering its operating strategies. Devon maintains its own internal Environmental, Health and Safety Department. This department is responsible for instituting and maintaining an environmental and safety compliance program for Devon. The program includes field inspections of properties and internal assessments of Devons compliance procedures. Devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation activities associated with past operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and similar state statutes. In response to liabilities associated with these activities, accruals have been established when reasonable estimates are possible. Such accruals primarily include estimated costs associated with remediation. Devon has not used discounting in determining its accrued liabilities for environmental remediation, and no material claims for possible recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to environmental costs have been recognized in Devons consolidated financial statements. Devon adjusts the accruals when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become estimable, or when current remediation estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information. Certain of Devons subsidiaries acquired in past mergers are involved in matters in which it has been alleged that such subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") under CERCLA or similar state legislation with respect to various waste disposal areas owned or operated by third parties. As of December 31, 2002, Devons consolidated balance sheet included $8 million of non current accrued liabilities, reflected in "Other liabilities," related to these and other environmental remediation liabilities. Devon does not currently believe there is a reasonable possibility of incurring additional material costs in excess of the current accruals recognized for such environmental remediation activities. With respect to the sites in which Devon subsidiaries are PRPs, Devons conclusion is based in large part on (i) Devons participation in consent decrees with both other PRPs and the Environmental Protection Agency, which provide for performing the scope of work required for remediation and contain covenants not to sue as protection to the PRPs, (ii) participation in groups as a de minimis PRP, and (iii) the availability of other defenses to liability. As a result, Devons monetary exposure is not expected to be material. 10 CANADIAN REGULATIONS The oil and gas industry in Canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government. It is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect Devons Canadian operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size. The following are the most important areas of control and regulation. The North American Free Trade Agreement. The North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA") which became effective on January 1, 1994 carries forward most of the material energy terms contained in the Canada U.S. Free Trade Agreement. In the context of energy resources, Canada continues to remain free to determine whether exports to the United States or Mexico will be allowed, provided that any export restrictions do not (i) reduce the proportion of energy exported relative to the supply of the energy resource; (ii) impose an export price higher than the domestic price; or (iii) disrupt normal channels of supply. All parties to NAFTA are also prohibited from imposing minimum export or import price requirements. Royalties and Incentives. Each province and the federal government of Canada have legislation and regulations governing land tenure, royalties, production rates and taxes, environmental protection and other matters under their respective jurisdictions. The royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production. Royalties payable on production from lands other than Crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties. Crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices, well productivity, geographical location, field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced. From time to time, the governments of Canada, Alberta and British Columbia have also established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions, royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects. These incentives generally have the effect of increasing the cash flow to the producer. Pricing and Marketing. The price of oil and natural gas sold is determined by negotiation between buyers and sellers. An order from the National Energy Board ("NEB") is required for oil exports from Canada. Any oil export to be made pursuant to an export contract of longer than one year, in the case of light crude, and two years, in the case of heavy crude, duration (up to 25 years) requires an exporter to obtain an export license from the NEB. The issue of such a license requires the approval of the Government of Canada. Natural gas exported from Canada is also subject to similar regulation by the NEB. Exporters are free to negotiate prices and other terms with purchasers, provided that the export contracts in excess of two years must continue to meet certain criteria prescribed by the NEB. The governments of Alberta and British Columbia also regulate the volume of natural gas which may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve availability, transportation arrangements and market considerations. Environmental Regulation. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. Environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with certain oil and gas industry operations. In addition, legislation requires that well and facility sites be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities. A breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties. Devon is committed to meeting its responsibilities to protect the environment wherever it operates and anticipates making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment. Devons unreimbursed expenditures in 2002 concerning such matters were immaterial, but Devon cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its future exposure concerning such matters. Kyoto Protocol. In December 2002 the Government of Canada ratified the Kyoto Protocol. This protocol calls for Canada to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 6 percent below 1990 levels during the period between 2008 and 2012. The protocol will only become legally binding when it is ratified by at least 55 countries, covering at least 55 percent of the emissions addressed by the protocol. If the protocol 11 becomes legally binding, it is expected to affect the operation of all industries in Canada, including the oil and gas industry. As details of the implementation of this protocol have yet to be announced, the effect on Devon cannot be determined at this time. Investment Canada Act. The Investment Canada Act requires Government of Canada approval, in certain cases, of the acquisition of control of a Canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by Canadians. In certain circumstances, the acquisition of natural resource properties may be considered to be a transaction requiring such approval. INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS The oil and gas industry is subject to various types of regulation throughout the world. Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation, government agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas drilling and production activities, increase the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability. Inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, Devon is unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations. The following are significant areas of regulation. Exploration and Production. Devons oil and gas concessions and permits are granted by host governments and administered by various foreign government agencies. Such foreign governments require compliance with detailed regulations and orders which regulate, among other matters, drilling and operations on areas covered by concessions and permits and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments, taxes and minimum investments to the government. Regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells; implementing spill prevention plans; submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities, surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production. Devons operations are also subject to regulations which may limit the number of wells or the locations at which Devon can drill. Production Sharing Contracts. Many of Devons international licenses are governed by Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) between the concessionaires and the granting government agency. PSCs are contracts that define and regulate the framework for investments, revenue sharing, and taxation of mineral interests in foreign countries. Unlike most domestic leases, PSCs have defined production terms and time limits of generally 30 years. Many PSCs allow for recovery of investments including carried government percentages. PSCs generally contain sliding scale revenue sharing provisions. For example, at either higher production rates or higher cumulative rates of return, PSCs allow governments to generally retain higher fractions of revenue. Environmental Regulations. Various government laws and regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of contaminants or otherwise relating to the protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment, affect Devons exploration, development, processing and production operations and the costs attendant thereto. In general, this consists of preparing Environmental Impact Assessments in order to receive required environmental permits to conduct drilling or construction activities. Such regulations also typically include requirements to develop emergency response plans, waste management plans, and spill contingency plans. In some countries, the application of worldwide standards, such as ISO 14000 governing Environmental Management Systems, are required to be implemented for international oil and gas operations. 12 EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2002, Devons staff consisted of 3,436 full time employees. Devon believes that it has good labor relations with its employees. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Substantially all of Devons properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage located in Devons core operating areas and mid stream assets. These interests entitle Devon to drill for and produce oil, natural gas and NGLs from specific areas. Devons interests are mostly in the form of working interests and, to a lesser extent, overriding royalty, volumetric production payments, foreign government concessions, mineral and net profits interests and other forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties. Devons most significant midstream asset is its 3,100 mile Bridgeport pipeline system and 650 MMcfd Bridgeport gas processing plant located in North Texas. PROVED RESERVES AND ESTIMATED FUTURE NET REVENUE Set forth below is a summary of the reserves which were evaluated by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000. 2002 2001 2000 ESTIMATED AUDITED ESTIMATED AUDITED ESTIMATED AUDITED Domestic...................... 12% 61% 67% 9% 80% 17% Canada........................ 31% % 43% % 100% % International................. 100% % 100% % 100% % Estimated reserves are those quantities of reserves which were estimated by an independent petroleum consultant. Audited reserves are those quantities of reserves which were estimated by Devon employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant.

NGL reserves are converted to Boe on a one to one basis with oil. The respective prices of gas and oil are affected by market conditions and other factors in addition to relative energy content. 14 (2) Estimated future net revenue represents estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and development costs. The amounts shown do not give effect to non property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses not related directly to oil and gas producing, debt service and future income tax expense or to depreciation, depletion and amortization. These amounts were calculated using prices and costs in effect as of December 31, 2002. These prices were not changed except where different prices were fixed and determinable from applicable contracts. These assumptions yield average prices over the life of Devons properties of $27.99 per Bbl of oil, $3.88 per Mcf of natural gas and $17.07 per Bbl of NGLs. These prices compare to December 31, 2002, New York Mercantile Exchange prices of $31.20 per Bbl for crude oil and of $4.74 per MMBtu for natural gas. (3) See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. No estimates of Devons proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of the last fiscal year except (i) in filings with the SEC and Canadian Securities Regulators and (ii) in filings with the Department of Energy ("DOE"). Reserve estimates filed by Devon with the SEC and Canadian Securities Regulators correspond with the estimates of Devon reserves contained herein. Reserve estimates filed with the DOE are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of Devons reserves included herein. However, the DOE requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that Devon operates and to exclude all interests in wells that Devon does not operate. The prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil, gas and NGL production subsequent to December 31, 2002. There can be no assurance that all of the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods indicated, that the assumed prices will be realized or that existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced. The process of estimating oil, gas and NGLs reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of, among other things, additional development activity, production history and viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur in the future. PRODUCTION, REVENUE AND PRICE HISTORY Certain information concerning oil and natural gas production, prices, revenues (net of all royalties, overriding royalties and other third party interests) and operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2002, is set forth in "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

OPERATION OF PROPERTIES The day to day operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements. The operator supervises production, maintains production records, employs field personnel and performs other functions. The charges under operating agreements customarily vary with the depth and location of the well being operated. Devon is the operator of 14,001 of its wells. As operator, Devon receives reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of its duties as well as monthly per well producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area to or by unaffiliated third parties. In presenting its financial data, Devon records the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense, which is a common industry practice. ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE Devons North American properties are concentrated within five geographic areas. Operations in the United States are focused in the Permian Basin, the Mid Continent, the Rocky Mountains and onshore and offshore Gulf Coast regions. Canadian operations are focused in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta and British Columbia. Operations outside North America currently include Azerbaijan, Brazil, China and West Africa. Maintaining a tight geographic focus in selected core areas has allowed Devon to improve operating and capital efficiency. 16 UNITED STATES PROPERTIES The Permian Basin The Permian Basin includes portions of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. These assets include conventional oil and gas properties from a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths. The Permian Basin represented 9% of Devons proved reserves at December 31, 2002. Devons leasehold position in Southeast New Mexico encompasses more than 102,000 acres of developed lands and 237,000 acres of undeveloped land and minerals. Historically, Devon has been a very active operator in this area developing gas from the high productivity Morrow formation and oil in the lower risk Delaware formation. In the West Texas area of the Permian Basin, Devon maintains a base of oil production with long life reserves. Many of these reserves are from both operated and non operated positions in large enhanced oil recovery units such as the Wasson ODC Unit, the Willard Unit, the Reeves Unit, the North Welch Unit and the Anton Irish (Clearfork) Unit. These oil producing units often exhibit long lives with low decline rates. Devon also owns a significant acreage position in West Texas with over 194,000 acres of developed lands and over 224,000 acres of undeveloped land and minerals at December 31, 2002. Mid Continent The Mid Continent region includes portions of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Mississippi and Louisiana. These areas encompass a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths and produce both oil and natural gas. Devons Mid Continent production has historically come from conventional oil and gas properties, but Devon has recently established two non conventional gas operations in the Mid Continent region: the Barnett Shale and the Cherokee coalbed methane project. The Mid Continent region represented 30% of Devons proved reserves at December 31, 2002. The most significant asset acquired by Devon in its 2002 acquisition of Mitchell was a substantial interest in the Barnett Shale of North Texas. The Barnett Shale is known as a tight gas formation. This means that, in its natural state, the formation is resistant to the production of natural gas. Mitchell spent decades understanding how to efficiently develop and produce this gas. The resulting technology yielded a low risk and highly profitable natural gas operation. Devon holds 525,000 net acres and over 1,100 producing wells in the Barnett Shale. Devons average working interest is approximately 95%. The Barnett Shale is a unique, unconventional natural gas resource that offers immediate low risk production growth and the potential for additional drilling locations. Devon has experienced success extracting gas from the Barnett Shale by using light sand fracturing. Light sand fracturing yields better results than earlier techniques and is less expensive and can be used to complete new wells and to refracture existing wells. Refractured wells often exceed their original flow rates. Devon is also investigating horizontal drilling and closer well spacing to further enhance the value of the Barnett Shale. Devons marketing and midstream business transports, treats and processes its Barnett Shale production along with Barnett Shale production from unrelated third parties. The transport system consists of approximately 3,100 miles of pipeline, a 650 MMcf per day gas processing plant, and a 15,000 Bbls per day NGL fractionator. In 2003, Devon plans to drill up to 450 new Barnett Shale wells and refracture 64 wells. Devon is also conducting exploratory pilot projects outside the core development area in an effort to expand the productive area. The Barnett Shale is expected to continue to be an important growth area for Devon for the foreseeable future. Current production from the Barnett Shale is approximately 345 MMcf and 21,700 Bbls of oil and NGLs per day net. The other non conventional asset Devon is developing in the Mid Continent region is the Cherokee coalbed methane project. Coalbed methane is natural gas produced from underground coal deposits. Devon 17 acquired over 400,000 net acres within the Cherokee area of Southeast Kansas and Northeast Oklahoma in 2001. Devons East Texas properties are a significant conventional asset. A large portion of this asset base was initially acquired in 1999. The Carthage and Bethany fields are two of the primary properties. These properties produce from the Cotton Valley sands, the Travis Peak sands and from shallower sands and carbonates. Devon operates over 500 producing wells in this area and utilizes a one to two rig drilling program to continue the low risk, infill development of this area. The 2002 acquisition of Mitchell added a complementary asset base to the East Texas area. These properties are located on the western side of the East Texas Basin and produce from the Bossier, Cotton Valley and Travis Peaks sands. Devon operates approximately 400 producing wells in this area and plans to continue the development drilling program with one to two rigs. Devons current net production in East Texas is approximately 123 MMcf and 3,800 Bbls of oil and NGLs per day. Rocky Mountain Region Devons operations in the Rocky Mountain region include properties in Wyoming, Utah, and Northern New Mexico. These assets include conventional oil and gas properties and coalbed methane projects. As of December 31, 2002, the Rocky Mountain region comprised 11% of Devons proved reserves. Devon began producing coalbed methane in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico in the mid 1980s and began drilling coalbed methane wells in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming in 1998. As of December 31, 2002, Devon has drilled over 1,500 coalbed methane wells in the Powder River Basin. Devons net coalbed methane gas production from the basin was approximately 80 MMcf per day as of December 31, 2002, and Devon plans to drill more than 100 wells in the Powder River Basin in 2003. Current production in the basin is primarily from the Wyodak coal formation. The deeper Big George formation is currently being tested by Devon and others with working interests in the area. Increased development in the Big George is subject to an Environmental Impact Statement, which has been completed and is expected to be approved within the next few months. Pending this approval and the success of current pilot projects, the Big George could significantly expand the coalbed methane play into the western portion of the Powder River Basin. Devons leasehold in this area would allow for the development of four projects in the Big George. Devon is also continuing to develop conventional gas operations at the Washakie field in Wyoming. Devon drilled 31 wells in 2002 and plans to drill another 30 wells in 2003. Devon has interests in over 200,000 acres. Devons current net production from Washakie is approximately 77 MMcf and 1,100 Bbls of oil and NGLs per day. GULF OF MEXICO AND GULF COAST Devon is active in the offshore Gulf of Mexico and onshore South Texas and South Louisiana. Devon operates 100 structures in the Gulf of Mexico predominantly in the outer shelf area offshore Louisiana. The Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast region represented 5% of Devons proved reserves at December 31, 2002. Devon is applying four component, or 4 C, seismic technology to identify prospects on large tracts of its shelf acreage. Traditional seismic techniques have not been successful in imaging reservoirs lying below shallow gas reservoirs and salt deposits, but 4 C seismic technology is allowing Devons geoscientists to more accurately picture these unexplored formations. Devon has conducted two large 4 C seismic surveys offshore Louisiana and, in 2002, Devon drilled four successful wells in the West Cameron area based on 4 C data. Devon is also reprocessing large seismic data volumes using pre stack depth migration to prospect for oil and gas in the outer shelf. In addition, Devon is utilizing new long cable 3 D seismic data to better image deep shelf prospects. Devon has developed a significant inventory of drilling opportunities for deeper gas near our infrastructure in offshore Louisiana and offshore Texas. 18 In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Devon participated in its first subsalt discovery in 1999 in the Enchilada Field located in Garden Banks 128. Since then Devon has operated several successful subsea completions ranging from Garden Banks to Viosca Knoll. Devon has experience with the successful installation and operation of subsea production equipment, which is an important component of any deepwater program. Devons Pecten discovery in Viosca Knoll Block 694, a subsea tieback completed in 2001, is currently producing approximately 17 MMcf of gas per day. Because deepwater exploration requires significant capital expenditures, Devons strategy is to share projects with experienced partners to mitigate risk. In 2002, Devon entered into a four well joint venture with ChevronTexaco that will earn Devon a 25% working interest in 71 deepwater blocks and 14 identified exploratory prospects. Devon also made a potentially significant discovery in 2002 in 8,200 feet of water at Cascade located in Walker Ridge Block 206 and plans to participate with other partners in four or five deepwater wells in 2003, including a confirmation well at Cascade. Devons operations in the Gulf Coast region include operations onshore in South Texas, where exploration for oil and gas is accelerating. Devons activities in this area have focused on exploration in the Edwards, Wilcox and Frio/Vicksburg formations. Devon also acquired additional production and undeveloped acreage in the South Texas area from its acquisition of Mitchell. CANADA Devons acquisition of Anderson in late 2001 significantly increased the relative importance of Devons Canadian operations. The Anderson acquisition strengthened Devons holdings in the Deep Basin located in Western Alberta and Eastern British Columbia, and the Foothills Region of Northeastern British Columbia. As of December 31, 2002, 36% of Devons proved reserves were in Canada. Devon had sought for years to obtain a significant acreage position in the Deep Basin, but other operators, including Anderson, already controlled most of the acreage. As a result of the Anderson acquisition, Devon now holds over 800,000 net acres in the Deep Basin. The profitability of Devons operations in the Deep Basin is enhanced by its ownership in nine gas processing plants in the area. Devon plans to drill about 100 wells in the Deep Basin in 2003. These reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids, producing up to 100 barrels of NGLs with each MMcf of gas. Late in 2002, Devon commenced production from the first of several wells it has drilled in the Grizzly Valley area of the Foothills Region of Northeastern British Columbia. Due to gas pipeline and processing limitations, initial production has been limited to 10 MMcf of gas per day. However, a pipeline extension slated for completion in the second quarter of 2003 should allow production to increase to about 35 MMcf per day. Devon acquired from Anderson approximately 1.5 million net acres in the MacKenzie Delta region and the shallow waters of the Beaufort Sea in Northern Canada. In 2002, a Devon well in the MacKenzie Delta encountered over 110 feet of natural gas pay in the Kamik sand. Two to three more exploratory wells are planned by Devon in the MacKenzie Delta in 2003. Devon has been active for over a decade in Northeastern British Columbia, an area in which Devon owns approximately 1.35 million net undeveloped acres of land. In 2002, Devon participated in the drilling of 67 gross wells and plans to participate in the drilling of approximately 93 wells in 2003. The Peace River Arch area is a more mature area with both light oil and natural gas potential. Most of Devons position in the Peace River Arch was acquired through the Anderson acquisition. Devon holds roughly 730,000 net undeveloped acres in the Peace River Arch, and the average production in 2002 was approximately 140 MMcf of natural gas and 7,500 Bbls of NGLs per day net. In 2003, Devon plans to participate in the drilling of 71 gross wells in the Peace River Arch. Devon has an interest in a production and processing infrastructure in the Peace River Arch, which enhances Devons operations in the area. 19 In the Northern Plains region of Northeastern Alberta, Devon has been active for many years. While the area is a highly developed area with winter only access, Devon is very active, drilling in excess of 100 gross wells per year. In 2002, average daily net production from the area was about 150 MMcf of natural gas and approximately 3,400 Bbls of NGLs net. Natural gas is encountered in multiple horizons at depths generally less than 1,300 feet. Devon holds approximately 2 million net undeveloped acres in this area. Devon has about 400,000 net undeveloped acres in the central and southern region of Alberta and the average production from this area in 2002 was approximately 80 MMcf of natural gas and 20,000 Bbls of NGLs per day net. Planned activity in 2003 includes drilling approximately 70 gross wells that vary from deep Devonian tests to shallow Cretaceous tests. Devon is also active in exploration for and production of "cold flow" heavy oil in the Lloydminster area of Alberta and Saskatchewan where oil is found in multiple horizons generally at depths of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. In 2003, Devon plans to drill 134 gross wells with primarily a development focus. Average daily production from the area in 2002 was approximately 37 MMcf of natural gas and 13,750 Bbls of crude oil net. Devon is also active in the evaluation of thermal heavy oil in Alberta through its 13% ownership interest in the Surmont project, operated by ConocoPhillips, and is actively evaluating the development of a 100% working interest heavy oil lease at Jackfish and an 83% working interest heavy oil project at Dover. Each of these heavy oil projects target bitumen (heavy tar like oil) through the use of Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage whereby a pair of horizontal wells are utilized. Steam is injected in one well and is used to heat the bitumen to allow it to gravity drain to the other horizontal production well. INTERNATIONAL Devons international activities are currently focused in development projects in Azerbaijan and China and deepwater exploration in the combined South Atlantic Margin of Brazil and West Africa. In 2002, Devon divested all remaining interests in Argentina, Indonesia and Egypt. As of December 31, 2002, 9% of Devons proved reserves were in countries outside North America. In Azerbaijan, Devon has a 5.6% carried working interest in the large Azeri Chirag Gunashli, or ACG, oil development project. Devon estimates that the ACG field contains over 4.6 billion barrels of gross proved oil reserves. The development project commenced in 2002. The Baku TBilisi Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline to export oil for this project has been approved by the governments of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. In China, Devon is an acreage holder in the Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South China Sea and has been successful in discovering two new fields. Devon is currently developing the Devon operated Panyu development project and expects oil production from two offshore platforms and into a floating production storage and offloading vessel to commence in late 2003. Gross capital expenditures for the project are $340 million, with Devon owning a 24.5% working interest. Peak production is expected to reach 58,000 Bbls of oil per day (15,000 Bbls of oil per day net to Devon) in 2004. Devons international exploration efforts are strategically focused in the combined South Atlantic deep water region of West Africa and Brazil. Devons presence in West Africa began in 1992 with exploration efforts resulting in the discoveries of the Tchatamba fields in the shallow waters offshore Gabon. In this region, Devon has five blocks and holds over 3.2 million net acres. Devon plans to drill deepwater exploratory wells in its West Africa portfolio in Ghana and Gabon in 2003. In Brazil, Devon will be acquiring a 3 D survey in a Devon operated deepwater block in early 2003 in order to identify future drilling opportunities. 20 SIGNIFICANT PROPERTIES The following table sets forth proved reserve information on the most significant geographic areas in which Devons properties are located as of December 31, 2002.

Devon believes that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business. As is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties, little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition (other than a preliminary review of local records). Investigations, generally including a title opinion of outside counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. 21 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ROYALTY MATTERS Numerous gas producers and related parties, including Devon, have been named in various lawsuits filed by private litigants alleging violation of the federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the producers and related parties used below market prices, improper deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and sold from federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. The various suits have been consolidated by the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for pre trial proceedings in the matter of In re Natural Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litigation, MDL 1293, United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. Devon believes that it has acted reasonably, has legitimate and strong defenses to all allegations in the suits, and has paid royalties in good faith. Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with these lawsuits, and no liability has been recorded in connection therewith. Also, pending in federal court in Texas is a similar suit alleging underpaid royalties to the United States in connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and sold from United States owned and or controlled lands. The claims were filed by private litigants against Devon and numerous other producers, under the federal False Claims Act. The United States served notice of its intent to intervene as to certain defendants, but not Devon. Devon and certain other defendants are challenging the constitutionality of whether a claim under the federal False Claims Act can be maintained absent government intervention. Devon believes that it has acted reasonably and paid royalties in good faith. Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this litigation. As a result, Devons monetary exposure in this suit is not expected to be material. Devon is a defendant in certain private royalty owner litigation filed in Wyoming regarding deductibility of certain post production costs from royalties payable by Devon. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits propose to expand them into county or state wide class actions relating specifically to transportation and related costs associated with Devons Wyoming gas production. A significant portion of such production is, or will be, transported through facilities owned by Thunder Creek Gas Services, L.L.C., of which Devon owns a 75% interest. Devon believes that it has acted reasonably and paid royalties in good faith and in accordance with its obligations under its oil and gas leases and applicable law, and Devon does not believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this litigation. OTHER MATTERS Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings incidental to its business. However, to Devons knowledge as of the date of this report, there were no other material pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which any of its property is subject. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2002. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS MARKET PRICE Devons common stock has been traded on the American Stock Exchange (the "AMEX") since September 29, 1988. Prior to September 29, 1988, Devons common stock was privately held. Commencing on December 15, 1998, a new class of Devon exchangeable shares began trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSE") under the symbol "NSX". These shares are essentially equivalent to Devon common stock. However, because they are issued by Devons wholly owned subsidiary, Northstar, 22 they qualify as a domestic Canadian investment for Canadian shareholders. They are exchangeable at any time, on a one for one basis, for common shares of Devon at the holders option. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for Devon common stock and exchangeable shares as reported by the AMEX and TSE for the periods indicated.

Effective December 31, 1996, Devon increased its quarterly dividend payment to $0.05 per share. Devon anticipates continuing to pay regular quarterly dividends in the foreseeable future. Dividends are also paid on the exchangeable shares at the same rate and on the same dates as dividends paid on the common stock. On February 25, 2003, there were 25,470 holders of record of Devon common stock and 295 holders of record for the exchangeable shares. 23 ITEM 6.

Therefore, the cash dividends per share presented for 1998 through 2000 are not representative of the actual amounts paid by Devon on an historical basis. For the years 1998 through 2000, Devons historical cash dividends per share were $0.20 in each year. (2) For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges and the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends, (i) earnings consist of earnings before income taxes, plus fixed charges; (ii) fixed charges consist of interest expense, distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trust, amortization of costs relating to indebtedness and the preferred securities of subsidiary trust, and one third of rental expense estimated to be attributable to interest; and (iii) preferred stock dividends consist of the amount of pre tax earnings required to pay dividends on the outstanding preferred stock. For the years 2002, 1999 and 1998, earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by $135 million, $264 million and $305 million, respectively. For the years 2002, 1999 and 1998, earnings were insufficient to cover combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends by $151 million, $270 million and $305 million, respectively. (3) The preceding production, price and other data exclude the amounts related to discontinued operations for all periods presented. (4) Gas volumes are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf of gas per barrel of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of natural gas and oil, which rate is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of oil and gas prices. NGL volumes are converted to Boe on a one to one basis with oil. The respective prices of oil, gas and NGLs are affected by market and other factors in addition to relative energy content. 26 ITEM 7.

(2) Net refers to gross acres multiplied by Devons fractional working interests therein. OPERATION OF PROPERTIES The day to day operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements. The operator supervises production, maintains production records, employs field personnel and performs other functions. The charges under operating agreements customarily vary with the depth and location of the well being operated. Devon is the operator of 14,001 of its wells. As operator, Devon receives reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of its duties as well as monthly per well producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area to or by unaffiliated third parties. In presenting its financial data, Devon records the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense, which is a common industry practice. ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE Devons North American properties are concentrated within five geographic areas. Operations in the United States are focused in the Permian Basin, the Mid Continent, the Rocky Mountains and onshore and offshore Gulf Coast regions. Canadian operations are focused in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta and British Columbia. Operations outside North America currently include Azerbaijan, Brazil, China and West Africa. Maintaining a tight geographic focus in selected core areas has allowed Devon to improve operating and capital efficiency. 16 UNITED STATES PROPERTIES The Permian Basin The Permian Basin includes portions of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. These assets include conventional oil and gas properties from a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths. The Permian Basin represented 9% of Devons proved reserves at December 31, 2002. Devons leasehold position in Southeast New Mexico encompasses more than 102,000 acres of developed lands and 237,000 acres of undeveloped land and minerals. Historically, Devon has been a very active operator in this area developing gas from the high productivity Morrow formation and oil in the lower risk Delaware formation. In the West Texas area of the Permian Basin, Devon maintains a base of oil production with long life reserves. Many of these reserves are from both operated and non operated positions in large enhanced oil recovery units such as the Wasson ODC Unit, the Willard Unit, the Reeves Unit, the North Welch Unit and the Anton Irish (Clearfork) Unit. These oil producing units often exhibit long lives with low decline rates. Devon also owns a significant acreage position in West Texas with over 194,000 acres of developed lands and over 224,000 acres of undeveloped land and minerals at December 31, 2002. Mid Continent The Mid Continent region includes portions of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Mississippi and Louisiana. These areas encompass a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths and produce both oil and natural gas. Devons Mid Continent production has historically come from conventional oil and gas properties, but Devon has recently established two non conventional gas operations in the Mid Continent region: the Barnett Shale and the Cherokee coalbed methane project. The Mid Continent region represented 30% of Devons proved reserves at December 31, 2002. The most significant asset acquired by Devon in its 2002 acquisition of Mitchell was a substantial interest in the Barnett Shale of North Texas. The Barnett Shale is known as a tight gas formation. This means that, in its natural state, the formation is resistant to the production of natural gas. Mitchell spent decades understanding how to efficiently develop and produce this gas. The resulting technology yielded a low risk and highly profitable natural gas operation. Devon holds 525,000 net acres and over 1,100 producing wells in the Barnett Shale. Devons average working interest is approximately 95%. The Barnett Shale is a unique, unconventional natural gas resource that offers immediate low risk production growth and the potential for additional drilling locations. Devon has experienced success extracting gas from the Barnett Shale by using light sand fracturing. Light sand fracturing yields better results than earlier techniques and is less expensive and can be used to complete new wells and to refracture existing wells. Refractured wells often exceed their original flow rates. Devon is also investigating horizontal drilling and closer well spacing to further enhance the value of the Barnett Shale. Devons marketing and midstream business transports, treats and processes its Barnett Shale production along with Barnett Shale production from unrelated third parties. The transport system consists of approximately 3,100 miles of pipeline, a 650 MMcf per day gas processing plant, and a 15,000 Bbls per day NGL fractionator. In 2003, Devon plans to drill up to 450 new Barnett Shale wells and refracture 64 wells. Devon is also conducting exploratory pilot projects outside the core development area in an effort to expand the productive area. The Barnett Shale is expected to continue to be an important growth area for Devon for the foreseeable future. Current production from the Barnett Shale is approximately 345 MMcf and 21,700 Bbls of oil and NGLs per day net. The other non conventional asset Devon is developing in the Mid Continent region is the Cherokee coalbed methane project. Coalbed methane is natural gas produced from underground coal deposits. Devon 17 acquired over 400,000 net acres within the Cherokee area of Southeast Kansas and Northeast Oklahoma in 2001. Devons East Texas properties are a significant conventional asset. A large portion of this asset base was initially acquired in 1999. The Carthage and Bethany fields are two of the primary properties. These properties produce from the Cotton Valley sands, the Travis Peak sands and from shallower sands and carbonates. Devon operates over 500 producing wells in this area and utilizes a one to two rig drilling program to continue the low risk, infill development of this area. The 2002 acquisition of Mitchell added a complementary asset base to the East Texas area. These properties are located on the western side of the East Texas Basin and produce from the Bossier, Cotton Valley and Travis Peaks sands. Devon operates approximately 400 producing wells in this area and plans to continue the development drilling program with one to two rigs. Devons current net production in East Texas is approximately 123 MMcf and 3,800 Bbls of oil and NGLs per day. Rocky Mountain Region Devons operations in the Rocky Mountain region include properties in Wyoming, Utah, and Northern New Mexico. These assets include conventional oil and gas properties and coalbed methane projects. As of December 31, 2002, the Rocky Mountain region comprised 11% of Devons proved reserves. Devon began producing coalbed methane in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico in the mid 1980s and began drilling coalbed methane wells in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming in 1998. As of December 31, 2002, Devon has drilled over 1,500 coalbed methane wells in the Powder River Basin. Devons net coalbed methane gas production from the basin was approximately 80 MMcf per day as of December 31, 2002, and Devon plans to drill more than 100 wells in the Powder River Basin in 2003. Current production in the basin is primarily from the Wyodak coal formation. The deeper Big George formation is currently being tested by Devon and others with working interests in the area. Increased development in the Big George is subject to an Environmental Impact Statement, which has been completed and is expected to be approved within the next few months. Pending this approval and the success of current pilot projects, the Big George could significantly expand the coalbed methane play into the western portion of the Powder River Basin. Devons leasehold in this area would allow for the development of four projects in the Big George. Devon is also continuing to develop conventional gas operations at the Washakie field in Wyoming. Devon drilled 31 wells in 2002 and plans to drill another 30 wells in 2003. Devon has interests in over 200,000 acres. Devons current net production from Washakie is approximately 77 MMcf and 1,100 Bbls of oil and NGLs per day. GULF OF MEXICO AND GULF COAST Devon is active in the offshore Gulf of Mexico and onshore South Texas and South Louisiana. Devon operates 100 structures in the Gulf of Mexico predominantly in the outer shelf area offshore Louisiana. The Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast region represented 5% of Devons proved reserves at December 31, 2002. Devon is applying four component, or 4 C, seismic technology to identify prospects on large tracts of its shelf acreage. Traditional seismic techniques have not been successful in imaging reservoirs lying below shallow gas reservoirs and salt deposits, but 4 C seismic technology is allowing Devons geoscientists to more accurately picture these unexplored formations. Devon has conducted two large 4 C seismic surveys offshore Louisiana and, in 2002, Devon drilled four successful wells in the West Cameron area based on 4 C data. Devon is also reprocessing large seismic data volumes using pre stack depth migration to prospect for oil and gas in the outer shelf. In addition, Devon is utilizing new long cable 3 D seismic data to better image deep shelf prospects. Devon has developed a significant inventory of drilling opportunities for deeper gas near our infrastructure in offshore Louisiana and offshore Texas. 18 In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Devon participated in its first subsalt discovery in 1999 in the Enchilada Field located in Garden Banks 128. Since then Devon has operated several successful subsea completions ranging from Garden Banks to Viosca Knoll. Devon has experience with the successful installation and operation of subsea production equipment, which is an important component of any deepwater program. Devons Pecten discovery in Viosca Knoll Block 694, a subsea tieback completed in 2001, is currently producing approximately 17 MMcf of gas per day. Because deepwater exploration requires significant capital expenditures, Devons strategy is to share projects with experienced partners to mitigate risk. In 2002, Devon entered into a four well joint venture with ChevronTexaco that will earn Devon a 25% working interest in 71 deepwater blocks and 14 identified exploratory prospects. Devon also made a potentially significant discovery in 2002 in 8,200 feet of water at Cascade located in Walker Ridge Block 206 and plans to participate with other partners in four or five deepwater wells in 2003, including a confirmation well at Cascade. Devons operations in the Gulf Coast region include operations onshore in South Texas, where exploration for oil and gas is accelerating. Devons activities in this area have focused on exploration in the Edwards, Wilcox and Frio/Vicksburg formations. Devon also acquired additional production and undeveloped acreage in the South Texas area from its acquisition of Mitchell. CANADA Devons acquisition of Anderson in late 2001 significantly increased the relative importance of Devons Canadian operations. The Anderson acquisition strengthened Devons holdings in the Deep Basin located in Western Alberta and Eastern British Columbia, and the Foothills Region of Northeastern British Columbia. As of December 31, 2002, 36% of Devons proved reserves were in Canada. Devon had sought for years to obtain a significant acreage position in the Deep Basin, but other operators, including Anderson, already controlled most of the acreage. As a result of the Anderson acquisition, Devon now holds over 800,000 net acres in the Deep Basin. The profitability of Devons operations in the Deep Basin is enhanced by its ownership in nine gas processing plants in the area. Devon plans to drill about 100 wells in the Deep Basin in 2003. These reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids, producing up to 100 barrels of NGLs with each MMcf of gas. Late in 2002, Devon commenced production from the first of several wells it has drilled in the Grizzly Valley area of the Foothills Region of Northeastern British Columbia. Due to gas pipeline and processing limitations, initial production has been limited to 10 MMcf of gas per day. However, a pipeline extension slated for completion in the second quarter of 2003 should allow production to increase to about 35 MMcf per day. Devon acquired from Anderson approximately 1.5 million net acres in the MacKenzie Delta region and the shallow waters of the Beaufort Sea in Northern Canada. In 2002, a Devon well in the MacKenzie Delta encountered over 110 feet of natural gas pay in the Kamik sand. Two to three more exploratory wells are planned by Devon in the MacKenzie Delta in 2003. Devon has been active for over a decade in Northeastern British Columbia, an area in which Devon owns approximately 1.35 million net undeveloped acres of land. In 2002, Devon participated in the drilling of 67 gross wells and plans to participate in the drilling of approximately 93 wells in 2003. The Peace River Arch area is a more mature area with both light oil and natural gas potential. Most of Devons position in the Peace River Arch was acquired through the Anderson acquisition. Devon holds roughly 730,000 net undeveloped acres in the Peace River Arch, and the average production in 2002 was approximately 140 MMcf of natural gas and 7,500 Bbls of NGLs per day net. In 2003, Devon plans to participate in the drilling of 71 gross wells in the Peace River Arch. Devon has an interest in a production and processing infrastructure in the Peace River Arch, which enhances Devons operations in the area. 19 In the Northern Plains region of Northeastern Alberta, Devon has been active for many years. While the area is a highly developed area with winter only access, Devon is very active, drilling in excess of 100 gross wells per year. In 2002, average daily net production from the area was about 150 MMcf of natural gas and approximately 3,400 Bbls of NGLs net. Natural gas is encountered in multiple horizons at depths generally less than 1,300 feet. Devon holds approximately 2 million net undeveloped acres in this area. Devon has about 400,000 net undeveloped acres in the central and southern region of Alberta and the average production from this area in 2002 was approximately 80 MMcf of natural gas and 20,000 Bbls of NGLs per day net. Planned activity in 2003 includes drilling approximately 70 gross wells that vary from deep Devonian tests to shallow Cretaceous tests. Devon is also active in exploration for and production of "cold flow" heavy oil in the Lloydminster area of Alberta and Saskatchewan where oil is found in multiple horizons generally at depths of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. In 2003, Devon plans to drill 134 gross wells with primarily a development focus. Average daily production from the area in 2002 was approximately 37 MMcf of natural gas and 13,750 Bbls of crude oil net. Devon is also active in the evaluation of thermal heavy oil in Alberta through its 13% ownership interest in the Surmont project, operated by ConocoPhillips, and is actively evaluating the development of a 100% working interest heavy oil lease at Jackfish and an 83% working interest heavy oil project at Dover. Each of these heavy oil projects target bitumen (heavy tar like oil) through the use of Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage whereby a pair of horizontal wells are utilized. Steam is injected in one well and is used to heat the bitumen to allow it to gravity drain to the other horizontal production well. INTERNATIONAL Devons international activities are currently focused in development projects in Azerbaijan and China and deepwater exploration in the combined South Atlantic Margin of Brazil and West Africa. In 2002, Devon divested all remaining interests in Argentina, Indonesia and Egypt. As of December 31, 2002, 9% of Devons proved reserves were in countries outside North America. In Azerbaijan, Devon has a 5.6% carried working interest in the large Azeri Chirag Gunashli, or ACG, oil development project. Devon estimates that the ACG field contains over 4.6 billion barrels of gross proved oil reserves. The development project commenced in 2002. The Baku TBilisi Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline to export oil for this project has been approved by the governments of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. In China, Devon is an acreage holder in the Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South China Sea and has been successful in discovering two new fields. Devon is currently developing the Devon operated Panyu development project and expects oil production from two offshore platforms and into a floating production storage and offloading vessel to commence in late 2003. Gross capital expenditures for the project are $340 million, with Devon owning a 24.5% working interest. Peak production is expected to reach 58,000 Bbls of oil per day (15,000 Bbls of oil per day net to Devon) in 2004. Devons international exploration efforts are strategically focused in the combined South Atlantic deep water region of West Africa and Brazil. Devons presence in West Africa began in 1992 with exploration efforts resulting in the discoveries of the Tchatamba fields in the shallow waters offshore Gabon. In this region, Devon has five blocks and holds over 3.2 million net acres. Devon plans to drill deepwater exploratory wells in its West Africa portfolio in Ghana and Gabon in 2003. In Brazil, Devon will be acquiring a 3 D survey in a Devon operated deepwater block in early 2003 in order to identify future drilling opportunities. 20 SIGNIFICANT PROPERTIES The following table sets forth proved reserve information on the most significant geographic areas in which Devons properties are located as of December 31, 2002.

Devon believes that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business. As is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties, little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition (other than a preliminary review of local records). Investigations, generally including a title opinion of outside counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. 21 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ROYALTY MATTERS Numerous gas producers and related parties, including Devon, have been named in various lawsuits filed by private litigants alleging violation of the federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the producers and related parties used below market prices, improper deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and sold from federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. The various suits have been consolidated by the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for pre trial proceedings in the matter of In re Natural Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litigation, MDL 1293, United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. Devon believes that it has acted reasonably, has legitimate and strong defenses to all allegations in the suits, and has paid royalties in good faith. Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with these lawsuits, and no liability has been recorded in connection therewith. Also, pending in federal court in Texas is a similar suit alleging underpaid royalties to the United States in connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and sold from United States owned and or controlled lands. The claims were filed by private litigants against Devon and numerous other producers, under the federal False Claims Act. The United States served notice of its intent to intervene as to certain defendants, but not Devon. Devon and certain other defendants are challenging the constitutionality of whether a claim under the federal False Claims Act can be maintained absent government intervention. Devon believes that it has acted reasonably and paid royalties in good faith. Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this litigation. As a result, Devons monetary exposure in this suit is not expected to be material. Devon is a defendant in certain private royalty owner litigation filed in Wyoming regarding deductibility of certain post production costs from royalties payable by Devon. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits propose to expand them into county or state wide class actions relating specifically to transportation and related costs associated with Devons Wyoming gas production. A significant portion of such production is, or will be, transported through facilities owned by Thunder Creek Gas Services, L.L.C., of which Devon owns a 75% interest. Devon believes that it has acted reasonably and paid royalties in good faith and in accordance with its obligations under its oil and gas leases and applicable law, and Devon does not believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this litigation. OTHER MATTERS Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings incidental to its business. However, to Devons knowledge as of the date of this report, there were no other material pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which any of its property is subject. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2002. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS MARKET PRICE Devons common stock has been traded on the American Stock Exchange (the "AMEX") since September 29, 1988. Prior to September 29, 1988, Devons common stock was privately held. Commencing on December 15, 1998, a new class of Devon exchangeable shares began trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSE") under the symbol "NSX". These shares are essentially equivalent to Devon common stock. However, because they are issued by Devons wholly owned subsidiary, Northstar, 22 they qualify as a domestic Canadian investment for Canadian shareholders. They are exchangeable at any time, on a one for one basis, for common shares of Devon at the holders option. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for Devon common stock and exchangeable shares as reported by the AMEX and TSE for the periods indicated.

Effective December 31, 1996, Devon increased its quarterly dividend payment to $0.05 per share. Devon anticipates continuing to pay regular quarterly dividends in the foreseeable future. Dividends are also paid on the exchangeable shares at the same rate and on the same dates as dividends paid on the common stock. On February 25, 2003, there were 25,470 holders of record of Devon common stock and 295 holders of record for the exchangeable shares. 23 ITEM 6.

Therefore, the cash dividends per share presented for 1998 through 2000 are not representative of the actual amounts paid by Devon on an historical basis. For the years 1998 through 2000, Devons historical cash dividends per share were $0.20 in each year. (2) For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges and the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends, (i) earnings consist of earnings before income taxes, plus fixed charges; (ii) fixed charges consist of interest expense, distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trust, amortization of costs relating to indebtedness and the preferred securities of subsidiary trust, and one third of rental expense estimated to be attributable to interest; and (iii) preferred stock dividends consist of the amount of pre tax earnings required to pay dividends on the outstanding preferred stock. For the years 2002, 1999 and 1998, earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by $135 million, $264 million and $305 million, respectively. For the years 2002, 1999 and 1998, earnings were insufficient to cover combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends by $151 million, $270 million and $305 million, respectively. (3) The preceding production, price and other data exclude the amounts related to discontinued operations for all periods presented. (4) Gas volumes are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf of gas per barrel of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of natural gas and oil, which rate is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of oil and gas prices. NGL volumes are converted to Boe on a one to one basis with oil. The respective prices of oil, gas and NGLs are affected by market and other factors in addition to relative energy content. 26 ITEM 7.
