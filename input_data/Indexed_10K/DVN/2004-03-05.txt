Business General Devon Energy Corporation, including its subsidiaries, (Devon) is an independent energy company engaged primarily in oil and gas exploration, development and production, the acquisition of producing properties, the transportation of oil, gas, and NGLs and the processing of natural gas. Through its predecessors, Devon began operations in 1971 as a privately held company. In 1988, Devons common stock began trading publicly on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol DVN. In addition, commencing on December 15, 1998, a new class of Devon exchangeable shares began trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol NSX. These shares are essentially equivalent to Devon common stock. However, because they are issued by Devons wholly owned subsidiary, Northstar Energy Corporation (Northstar), they qualify as a domestic Canadian investment for Canadian shareholders. They are exchangeable at any time, on a one for one basis, for common shares of Devon. The principal and administrative offices of Devon are located at 20 North Broadway, Oklahoma City, OK 73102 8260 (telephone 405/235 3611). Devon operates oil and gas properties in the United States, Canada and various regions located outside North America. Devons North American properties are concentrated within five geographic areas. Operations in the United States are focused in the Permian Basin, the Mid Continent, the Rocky Mountains and onshore and offshore Gulf Coast. Canadian operations are focused in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta and British Columbia. Operations outside North America are located primarily in Azerbaijan, China, Egypt, and areas in West Africa, including Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Cote dIvoire. In addition to its oil and gas operations, Devon has marketing and midstream operations. These include marketing natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, and the construction and operation of pipelines, storage and treating facilities and gas processing plants. (A detailed description of Devons significant properties and associated 2003 developments can be found under Item 2. Properties). At December 31, 2003, Devons estimated proved reserves were 2,089 MMBoe, of which 58% were natural gas reserves and 42% were oil and NGLs reserves. The present value of pre tax future net revenues discounted at 10% per annum assuming essentially constant prices (10% Present Value) of such reserves was $22.7 billion. After taxes, the present value was $15.9 billion. Devon is one of the largest public independent oil and gas companies based in the United States, as measured by oil and gas reserves. Availability of Reports Devon makes available free of charge on its internet website, www.dvn.com, its Annual Report on Form 10 K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q, Current Reports on Form 8 K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files or furnishes them to the Securities Exchange Commission. Strategy Devons primary objectives are to build reserves, production, cash flow and earnings per share by (a) acquiring oil and gas properties, (b) exploring for new oil and gas reserves and (c) optimizing production and value from existing oil and gas properties. Devons management seeks to achieve these objectives by (a) concentrating its properties in core areas to achieve economies of scale, (b) acquiring and developing high profit margin properties, (c) continually disposing of marginal and non strategic properties, (d) balancing reserves between oil and gas, (e) maintaining a high degree of financial flexibility, and (f) enhancing the value of Devons production and reserves through marketing and midstream activities. 5 Table of Contents Development of Business During 1988, Devon expanded its capital base with its first issuance of common stock to the public. This transaction began a substantial expansion program that has continued through the subsequent years. Devon has used a two pronged strategy of acquiring producing properties and engaging in drilling activities to achieve this expansion. Total proved reserves increased from 8 MMBoe at year end 1987 (without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 mergers accounted for as poolings of interests) to 2,089 MMBoe at year end 2003. During the same time period, proved reserves have grown from 1.31 Boe per diluted share at year end 1987 (without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 poolings) to 9.65 Boe per diluted share at year end 2003. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 13%. Another measure of value per share is oil and gas production per share. Production increased from 0.18 Boe per diluted share in 1987 (without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 poolings) to 1.05 Boe per diluted share in 2003, a compound annual growth rate of 12%. On April 25, 2003, Devon completed its merger with Ocean Energy, Inc. (Ocean). In the transaction, Devon issued 0.414 shares of its common stock for each outstanding share of Ocean common stock, or a total of approximately 74 million shares. Also, Devon assumed approximately $1.8 billion of debt from Ocean. The Ocean merger added approximately 554 million Boe to Devons proved reserves. Cash flow from operations was $3.8 billion for 2003. This allowed Devon to fully fund its $2.6 billion of capital expenditures, retire over $500 million in long term debt and add almost $1 billion to cash on hand. Devon is continuing to accumulate cash with the intent to repay debt as it matures in 2004 and subsequent years. Devon drilled almost 300 exploration wells and over 1,900 development wells during 2003. See further discussion of Devons 2003 exploration and drilling efforts in Item 2. Properties. On January 24, 2002, Devon completed its merger with Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. (Mitchell). Under the terms of this merger, Devon issued approximately 30 million shares of Devon common stock and paid $1.6 billion in cash to the Mitchell stockholders. The cash portion of the merger was funded from borrowings under a $3.0 billion senior unsecured term loan credit facility. The Mitchell merger added approximately 404 million Boe to Devons proved reserves. On October 15, 2001, Devon acquired Anderson Exploration Ltd. (Anderson) for approximately $3.5 billion in cash. The Anderson acquisition added approximately 534 million Boe to Devons proved reserves. To fund the cash portions of the Mitchell merger and the Anderson acquisition, as well as to pay related transaction costs and retire certain long term debt assumed from Mitchell and Anderson, Devon entered into long term debt agreements in October 2001 that totaled $6 billion. Half of this total consisted of $3 billion of notes and debentures issued on October 3, 2001. Of this total, $1.25 billion bears interest at 7.875% and matures in September 2031. The remaining $1.75 billion bears interest at 6.875% and matures in September 2011. The remaining $3 billion of the $6 billion of long term debt was borrowed under a credit facility that bears interest at floating rates. As of December 31, 2003, $2.4 billion of the original $3 billion balance had been retired. The primary sources of the repayments were the issuance of $1.5 billion of debt securities, of which $1.3 billion was used to pay down the credit facility with the remainder used to pay down other debt, and $1.4 billion from the sale of certain oil and gas properties, of which $1.1 billion was used to pay down the credit facility. As of December 31, 2003, the balance outstanding under the term loan credit facility was $0.6 billion at an average rate of 2.2%. The terms of this facility require repayment of the remaining debt balance at maturity in October 2006. 6 Table of Contents Financial Information about Segments and Geographical Areas Notes 17 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report contains information on Devons segments and geographical areas. Drilling Activities Devon is engaged in numerous drilling activities on properties presently owned and intends to drill or develop other properties acquired in the future. Devons 2004 drilling activities will be focused in the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Mid Continent, Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast areas in the U.S., the Western Sedimentary basin of Canada and in Brazil, China, Egypt, Russia, Syria and West Africa outside North America. The following tables set forth the results of Devons drilling activity for the past five years.

(2) Net wells are the sum of Devons working interests in gross wells. As of December 31, 2003, Devon was participating in the drilling of 97 gross (61.46 net) wells in the U.S., 41 gross (29.36 net) wells in Canada and 39 gross (12.53 net) wells internationally. Of these wells, through February 1, 2004, 43 gross (30.62 net) wells in the U.S., 36 gross (26.14 net) wells in Canada, and 6 gross (2.23 net) wells internationally had been completed as productive. An additional 3 gross (1.20 net) wells in the U.S. and 1 gross (1.00 net) well in Canada were dry holes. The remaining wells were still in process. Customers Devon sells its gas production to a variety of customers including pipelines, utilities, gas marketing firms, industrial users and local distribution companies. Existing gathering systems and interstate and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas sales and deliveries. The principal customers for Devons crude oil production are refiners, remarketers and other companies, some of which have pipeline facilities near the producing properties. In the event pipeline facilities are not conveniently available, crude oil is shipped to storage, refining or pipeline facilities. No purchaser accounted for over 10% of Devons revenues in 2003. Oil and Natural Gas Marketing The spot market for oil and gas is subject to volatility as supply and demand factors in various regions of North America fluctuate. In addition to fixed price contracts, Devon periodically enters into financial hedging arrangements or firm delivery commitments with a portion of its oil and gas production. These activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage Devons exposure to price fluctuations. (See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.) Oil Marketing. Devons oil production is sold under both long term (one year or more) and short term (less than one year) agreements at prices negotiated with third parties. Natural Gas Marketing. Devons gas production is also sold under both long term and short term agreements at prices negotiated with third parties. Although exact percentages vary daily, as of February 2004 approximately 78% of Devons natural gas production was sold under short term contracts at variable or market sensitive prices. These market sensitive sales are referred to as spot market sales. Another 19% were committed under various long term contracts (one year or more) which dedicate the natural gas to a purchaser for an extended period of time, but still at market sensitive prices. Devons remaining gas production was sold under fixed price contracts: 1% under short term agreements and 2% under long term contracts. Typically either the entire contract (in the case of short term contracts) or the price provisions of the contract (in the case of long term contracts) are re negotiated from daily intervals up to one year 8 Table of Contents intervals. The spot market has become progressively more competitive in recent years. As a result, prices on the spot market have been volatile. Competition The oil and gas business is highly competitive. Devon encounters competition by major integrated and independent oil and gas companies in acquiring drilling prospects and properties, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Intense competition occurs with respect to marketing, particularly of natural gas. Certain competitors have resources that substantially exceed those of Devon. Seasonal Nature of Business Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, pipelines, utilities, local distribution companies and industrial users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. Government Regulation Devons operations are subject to various levels of government controls and regulations in the United States, Canada and international locations in which it operates. United States Regulation In the United States, legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation, numerous federal, state and local departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas drilling, pipelines, gas processing plants and production activities, increase the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability. Inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, Devon is unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations. Devon considers the cost of environmental protection a necessary and manageable part of its business. Devon has been able to plan for and comply with new environmental initiatives without materially altering its operating strategies. Exploration and Production. Devons United States operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells; implementing spill prevention plans; submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities, surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production. Devons operations are also subject to various conservation matters, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases, which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally limit the venting or flaring of gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and gas Devon can produce from its wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which Devon can drill. 9 Table of Contents Certain of Devons oil and gas leases, including its offshore Gulf of Mexico leases, most of its leases in the San Juan Basin and many of Devons leases in southeast New Mexico, Montana and Wyoming, are granted by the federal government and administered by various federal agencies, including the Minerals Management Service of the Department of the Interior (MMS). Such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders which regulate, among other matters, drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases, and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government. The MMS has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and, in some cases, promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) also has jurisdiction over certain offshore activities pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Environmental and Occupational Regulations. Various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of contaminants or otherwise relating to the protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment, affect Devons exploration, development, processing, and production operations and the costs attendant thereto. These laws and regulations increase Devons overall operating expenses. Devon maintains levels of insurance customary in the industry to limit its financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and accidental discharges of oil, salt water or other substances. However, 100% coverage is not maintained concerning any environmental claim, and no coverage is maintained with respect to any penalty or fine required to be paid by Devon because of its violation of any federal, state or local law. Devon is committed to meeting its responsibilities to protect the environment wherever it operates and anticipates making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment. Devons unreimbursed expenditures in 2003 concerning such matters were immaterial, but Devon cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its future exposure concerning such matters. Devon is also subject to laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health. Due to the continued changes in these laws and regulations, and the judicial construction of same, Devon is unable to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its future costs of complying with these laws and regulations. Devon considers the cost of safety and health compliance a necessary and manageable part of its business. Devon has been able to plan for and comply with new initiatives without materially altering its operating strategies. Devon maintains its own internal Environmental, Health and Safety Department. This department is responsible for instituting and maintaining an environmental and safety compliance program for Devon. The program includes field inspections of properties and internal assessments of Devons compliance procedures. Devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation activities associated with past operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar state statutes. In response to liabilities associated with these activities, accruals have been established when reasonable estimates are possible. Such accruals primarily include estimated costs associated with remediation. Devon has not used discounting in determining its accrued liabilities for environmental remediation, and no material claims for possible recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to environmental costs have been recognized in Devons consolidated financial statements. Devon adjusts the accruals when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become estimable, or when current remediation estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information. Certain of Devons subsidiaries acquired in past mergers are involved in matters in which it has been alleged that such subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties (PRPs) under CERCLA or similar state legislation with respect to various waste disposal areas owned or operated by third parties. As of December 31, 2003, Devons consolidated balance sheet included $9 million of non current accrued liabilities, reflected in Other liabilities, related to these and other environmental remediation liabilities. 10 Table of Contents Devon does not currently believe there is a reasonable possibility of incurring additional material costs in excess of the current accruals recognized for such environmental remediation activities. With respect to the sites in which Devon subsidiaries are PRPs, Devons conclusion is based in large part on (i) Devons participation in consent decrees with both other PRPs and the Environmental Protection Agency, which provide for performing the scope of work required for remediation and contain covenants not to sue as protection to the PRPs, (ii) participation in groups as a de minimis PRP, and (iii) the availability of other defenses to liability. As a result, Devons monetary exposure is not expected to be material. Canadian Regulations The oil and gas industry in Canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government. It is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect Devons Canadian operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size. The following are the most important areas of control and regulation. The North American Free Trade Agreement. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which became effective on January 1, 1994 carries forward most of the material energy terms contained in the Canada U.S. Free Trade Agreement. In the context of energy resources, Canada continues to remain free to determine whether exports to the United States or Mexico will be allowed, provided that any export restrictions do not (i) reduce the proportion of energy exported relative to the supply of the energy resource; (ii) impose an export price higher than the domestic price; or (iii) disrupt normal channels of supply. All parties to NAFTA are also prohibited from imposing minimum export or import price requirements. Exploration and Production. Devons Canadian operations are subject to federal and provincial governmental regulation. Such regulation include requiring licenses for the drilling of wells, regulating the location of wells and the method and ability to produce wells, surface usage and the restoration of land upon which wells have been drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transportation of production from wells. Devons Canadian operations are also subject to various conservation regulations, including the regulation of the size of spacing units, the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit, the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells, and the ability to produce oil and gas. In Canada, the effect of such regulation is to limit the amounts of oil and gas Devon can produce from its wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which Devon can drill. Royalties and Incentives. Each province and the federal government of Canada have legislation and regulations governing land tenure, royalties, production rates and taxes, environmental protection and other matters under their respective jurisdictions. The royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production. Royalties payable on production from lands other than Crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties. Crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices, well productivity, geographical location, field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced. From time to time, the governments of Canada, Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan have also established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions, royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects. These incentives generally have the effect of increasing the cash flow to the producer. Pricing and Marketing. The price of oil, natural gas and NGLs sold is determined by negotiation between buyers and sellers. An order from the National Energy Board (NEB) is required for oil exports from Canada. Any oil export to be made pursuant to an export contract of longer than one year, in the case of light crude, and two years, in the case of heavy crude, duration (up to 25 years) requires an exporter to obtain an export license from the NEB. The issue of such a license requires the approval of the Government of Canada. Natural gas exported from Canada is also subject to similar regulation by the NEB. Exporters are free to negotiate prices and other terms with purchasers, provided that the export 11 Table of Contents contracts in excess of two years must continue to meet certain criteria prescribed by the NEB. The governments of Alberta and British Columbia also regulate the volume of natural gas which may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve availability, transportation arrangements and market considerations. Environmental Regulation. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. Environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with certain oil and gas industry operations. In addition, legislation requires that well and facility sites be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities. A breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties. Devon is committed to meeting its responsibilities to protect the environment wherever it operates and anticipates making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment. Devons unreimbursed expenditures in 2003 concerning such matters were immaterial, but Devon cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its future exposure concerning such matters. Kyoto Protocol. In December 2002 the Government of Canada ratified the Kyoto Protocol. This protocol calls for Canada to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 6 percent below 1990 levels during the period between 2008 and 2012. The protocol will only become legally binding when it is ratified by at least 55 countries, covering at least 55 percent of the emissions addressed by the protocol. At this time, it is uncertain if the protocol will in fact be ratified. If the protocol becomes legally binding, it is expected to affect the operation of all industries in Canada, including the oil and gas industry. As details of the implementation of emissions reduction initiatives related to this protocol have yet to be announced, the effect on Devon cannot be determined at this time. Investment Canada Act. The Investment Canada Act requires Government of Canada approval, in certain cases, of the acquisition of control of a Canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by Canadians. In certain circumstances, the acquisition of natural resource properties may be considered to be a transaction requiring such approval. International Regulations The oil and gas industry is subject to various types of regulation throughout the world. Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation, government agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas exploration, drilling and production activities, increase the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability. Inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, Devon is unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations. The following are significant areas of regulation. Exploration and Production. Devons oil and gas concessions and operating licenses or permits are granted by host governments and administered by various foreign government agencies. Such foreign governments require compliance with detailed regulations and orders which regulate, among other matters, seismic, drilling and production operations on areas covered by concessions and permits and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments, taxes and minimum investments to the government. Regulation includes requiring permits for acquiring seismic data; drilling wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells; implementing spill prevention plans; submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities, surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production. Devons operations are also subject to regulations which may limit the number of wells or the locations at which Devon can drill. 12 Table of Contents Production Sharing Contracts. Many of Devons international licenses are governed by Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) between the concessionaires and the granting government agency. PSCs are contracts that define and regulate the framework for investments, revenue sharing, and taxation of mineral interests in foreign countries. Unlike most domestic leases, PSCs have defined production terms and time limits of generally 30 years. Many PSCs allow for recovery of investments including carried government percentages. PSCs generally contain sliding scale revenue sharing provisions. For example, at either higher production rates or higher cumulative rates of return, PSCs allow governments to generally retain higher fractions of revenue. Environmental Regulations. Various government laws and regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of waste or otherwise relating to the protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment, affect Devons exploration, development, processing and production operations and the costs attendant thereto. In general, this consists of preparing Environmental Impact Assessments in order to receive required environmental permits to conduct seismic acquisition, drilling or construction activities. Such regulations also typically include requirements to develop emergency response plans, waste management plans, environmental protection plans and spill contingency plans. In some countries, the application of worldwide standards, such as ISO 14000 governing Environmental Management Systems, are required to be implemented for international oil and gas operations. Employees As of December 31, 2003, Devons staff consisted of 3,924 full time employees. Devon believes that it has good labor relations with its employees. Item 2. Properties Substantially all of Devons properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage located in Devons core operating areas. These interests entitle Devon to drill for and produce oil, natural gas and NGLs from specific areas. Devons interests are mostly in the form of working interests and, to a lesser extent, overriding royalty, volumetric production payments, foreign government concessions, mineral and net profits interests and other forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties. Devon also has certain midstream assets, including natural gas and NGL processing plants and pipeline systems. Devons most significant midstream assets are its 3,100 mile Bridgeport pipeline system and 650 MMcf per day Bridgeport gas processing plant located in North Texas. Proved Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenue Set forth below is a summary of the reserves which were evaluated by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2003, 2002 and 2001. 2003 2002 2001 Prepared Audited Prepared Audited Prepared Audited Domestic 33 % 37 % 12 % 61 % 67 % 9 % Canada 28 % 31 % 43 % International 98 % 100 % 100 % Prepared reserves are those estimates of quantities of reserves which were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant. Audited reserves are those quantities of reserves which were estimated by Devon employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant. The domestic reserves were evaluated by the independent petroleum consultants of LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. and Ryder Scott Company, L.P. in each of the years presented. The Canadian reserves were evaluated by the independent petroleum consultants of AJM Petroleum 13 Table of Contents Consultants in 2003 and 2002, and Paddock Lindstrom & Associates and Gilbert Laustsen Jung Associates, Ltd. in 2001. The International reserves were evaluated by the independent petroleum consultants of Ryder Scott Company, L.P. in each of the years presented. Devon follows what it believes to be a rational approach to not only recording oil and gas reserves, but also to subjecting these reserves to reviews by independent petroleum consultants. The reserve estimates for all of our Gulf of Mexico and international properties are prepared by an independent petroleum consulting firm every year (excluding 2% of Devons 2003 international reserves that were estimated by in house engineers). In Canada, another independent petroleum consulting firm prepares a rolling one third of our properties each year so that the reserve estimates for all the Canadian properties are prepared by outside engineers over a three year cycle. For the U.S. onshore properties, reserve estimates of individually significant properties are either prepared or audited by an independent petroleum consulting firm, while estimates of minor properties are prepared by in house engineers. This approach results in independent engineers preparing or auditing over 50% of our U.S. onshore reserves each year. Over any three year period, more than 95% of Devons company wide reserve estimates are prepared or audited by an independent petroleum consulting firm. Devon believes this approach provides a high degree of assurance about the validity of our reserve estimates. This is evidenced by the fact that in the past four years, Devons annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately 2% of the previous years estimate. The following table sets forth Devons estimated proved reserves and the related estimated future net revenues, pre tax 10% Present Value and after tax standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of December 31, 2003. These estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Operations in Note 18 to Devons Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

NGL reserves are converted to Boe on a one to one basis with oil. The respective prices of gas and oil are affected by market conditions and other factors in addition to relative energy content. (2) Estimated future net revenue represents estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and development costs. The amounts shown do not give effect to non property related expenses such as debt service and future income tax expense or to depreciation, depletion and amortization. These amounts were calculated using prices and costs in effect as of December 31, 2003. These prices were not changed except where different prices were fixed and determinable from applicable contracts. These assumptions yield average prices over the life of Devons properties of $27.55 per Bbl of oil, $5.18 per Mcf of natural gas and $21.22 per Bbl of NGLs. These prices compare to December 31, 2003, New York Mercantile Exchange prices of $32.52 per Bbl for crude oil and $5.97 per MMBtu for natural gas. (3) See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. No estimates of Devons proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of the last fiscal year except (i) in filings with the SEC and Canadian Securities Regulators and (ii) in filings with the Department of Energy (DOE). Reserve estimates filed by Devon with the SEC and Canadian Securities Regulators correspond with the estimates of Devon reserves contained herein. Reserve estimates filed with the DOE are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of Devons reserves included herein. However, the DOE requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that Devon operates and to exclude all interests in wells that Devon does not operate. The prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil, gas and NGL production subsequent to December 31, 2003. There 15 Table of Contents can be no assurance that all of the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods indicated, that the assumed prices will be realized or that existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced. The process of estimating oil, gas and NGLs reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of, among other things, additional development activity, production history and viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur in the future. Production, Revenue and Price History Certain information concerning oil and natural gas production, prices, revenues (net of all royalties, overriding royalties and other third party interests) and operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2003, is set forth in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

(2) Net refers to gross acres multiplied by Devons fractional working interests therein. Operation of Properties The day to day operation of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements. The operator supervises production, maintains production records, employs field personnel and performs other functions. The charges under operating agreements customarily vary with the depth and location of the well being operated. Devon is the operator of 18,037 of its wells. As operator, Devon receives reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of its duties as well as monthly per well producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area. In presenting its financial data, Devon records the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense, which is a common industry practice. Organization Structure Devons North American properties are concentrated within five geographic areas. Operations in the United States are focused in the Permian Basin, the Mid Continent, the Rocky Mountains and onshore and offshore Gulf Coast regions. Canadian operations are focused in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta and British Columbia. Operations outside North America currently include Azerbaijan, Brazil, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Russia, Syria, and areas in West Africa, including Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Cote dIvoire, Nigeria and Angola. Maintaining a tight geographic focus in selected core areas has allowed Devon to improve operating and capital efficiency. The following table sets forth proved reserve information on the most significant geographic areas in which Devons properties are located as of December 31, 2003.

(6) Canadian dollars converted to U.S. dollars at the rate of $1 Canadian: $0.7738 U.S. United States Permian Basin Devons Permian Basin assets are located in portions of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. These assets include conventional oil and gas properties from a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths. The Permian Basin represented 8% of Devons proved reserves at December 31, 2003. Devons leasehold position in Southeast New Mexico encompasses more than 102,000 acres of developed lands and 237,000 acres of undeveloped land and minerals. Historically, Devon has been a very active operator in this area developing gas from the high productivity Morrow formation and oil in the lower risk Delaware formation. In the West Texas area of the Permian Basin, Devon maintains a base of oil production with long life reserves. Many of these reserves are from both operated and non operated positions in large enhanced oil recovery units such as the Wasson ODC Unit, the Willard Unit, the Reeves Unit, the North Welch Unit and the Anton Irish (Clearfork) Unit. These oil producing units often exhibit low decline rates. Devon also owns a significant acreage position in West Texas with over 194,000 acres of developed lands and over 224,000 acres of undeveloped land and minerals at December 31, 2003. Mid Continent The Mid Continent region includes portions of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. These areas encompass a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths and produce both oil and natural gas. Devons Mid Continent production has historically come from conventional oil and gas properties. However, the Barnett Shale, acquired in our 2002 merger with Mitchell Energy, is a non conventional gas resource. The Mid Continent region represented 19% of Devons proved reserves at December 31, 2003. Approximately 76% of Devons proved reserves in the Mid Continent area are in the Barnett Shale. The Barnett Shale, Devons largest producing field, is known as a tight gas formation. This means that, in its natural state, the formation is resistant to the production of natural gas. Mitchell spent decades understanding how to efficiently develop and produce this gas. The resulting technology has yielded a low risk and highly profitable natural gas operation. Devon holds 525,000 net acres and nearly 1,600 producing wells in the Barnett Shale. Devons average working interest is approximately 95%. Devon has experienced success extracting gas from the Barnett Shale by using light sand fracturing. Light sand fracturing yields better results than earlier techniques, is less expensive and can be used to complete new wells and to refracture existing wells. Refractured wells often exceed their original flow rates. Devon is also applying horizontal drilling and closer well spacing to further enhance the value of the Barnett Shale. Devons marketing and midstream operations transport and process its Barnett Shale production along with Barnett Shale production from unrelated third parties. The transport system consists of approximately 3,100 miles of pipeline, a 650 MMcf per day gas processing plant, and a 15,000 Bbls per day NGL fractionator. In 2004, Devon plans to drill a total of 192 new Barnett Shale wells including 94 horizontals and 98 verticals. More than half of the horizontal wells will be drilled outside the core development area in an 18 Table of Contents effort to further expand the productive area of the field. The Barnett Shale is expected to continue to be an important producing area for Devon for the foreseeable future. Current production from the Barnett Shale is approximately 428 MMcf and 24,100 Bbls of oil and NGLs per day net. Rocky Mountains Devons operations in the Rocky Mountain region include properties in Wyoming, Montana, Utah, and Northern New Mexico. These assets include conventional oil and gas properties and coalbed methane projects. As of December 31, 2003, the Rocky Mountain region comprised 9% of Devons proved reserves. Approximately 38% of Devons proved reserves in the Rocky Mountains are from coalbed methane. Devon began producing coalbed methane in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico in the mid 1980s and began drilling coalbed methane wells in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming in 1998. As of December 31, 2003, Devon has drilled 1,600 coalbed methane wells in the Powder River Basin. Devons net coalbed methane gas production from the basin was approximately 88 MMcf per day as of December 31, 2003, and Devon plans to drill 110 new wells in the Powder River Basin in 2004. Current production in the basin is primarily from the Wyodak coal formation. Development of the deeper Big George formation could significantly expand the coalbed methane play into the western portion of the Powder River Basin. The recently approved federal Environmental Impact Statement should facilitate development of the deeper formation. Eighty five of the wells planned in 2004 target these deeper coals. Devons most significant conventional gas project in the Rocky Mountains region is the Washakie field in Wyoming. Devon is continuing to develop and grow production from this field. In 2003, Devon drilled 38 wells and plans to drill another 40 wells in 2004. Devon has interests in over 200,000 acres. Devons current net production from Washakie is approximately 81 MMcf and 1,000 Bbls of oil and NGLs per day. Gulf Coast Devons Gulf Coast properties are located in South and East Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Most of the wells in the region are completed in conventional sandstone formations. At December 31, 2003, the Gulf Coast accounted for approximately 10% of Devons proved reserves. Devons operations in South Texas have focused on exploration in the Edwards, Wilcox and Frio/ Vicksburg formations. Devon has high working interests, up to 100%, in several producing fields. East Texas is an important conventional gas producing region for Devon. Carthage/ Bethany and Groesbeck are two of the primary producing areas. Wells produce from the Cotton Valley sands, the Travis Peak sands and from shallower sands and carbonates. Devon operates over 1,300 producing wells in East Texas and is currently employing a five rig drilling and recompletion program to continue low risk, infill development throughout the area. Devons current net production from east Texas is about 187 MMcf and 8,000 Bbls of oil and NGLs per day. Gulf of Mexico The offshore Gulf of Mexico accounted for 17% of Devons 2003 production and 11% of year end proved reserves. Devon is among the largest independent oil and gas producers in the Gulf of Mexico and operates 450 platforms and caissons. The 2003 merger with Ocean more than tripled Devons Gulf reserves. Gulf of Mexico operations are typically differentiated by water depth. The shelf is defined by water depths of 600 feet or less. The deepwater is at depths beyond 600 feet. Devon has active development and drilling programs ongoing in both the shelf and deepwater areas. In the Ocean merger, Devon acquired interests in the Nansen/ Boomvang complex in the East Breaks area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Devon acquired a 50% working interest in the Nansen field and a 20% interest in the Boomvang field. Ocean established oil and natural gas production at Nansen/ Boomvang in 2002. The Nansen and Boomvang production spars have a combined daily production 19 Table of Contents capacity of 80,000 Bbls of oil and 400 MMcf of gas. Devons share of current production from the fields is about 21,000 Bbls of oil and 120 MMcf of gas per day. Ocean had two additional deepwater development projects under construction in 2003. Redhawk (Garden Banks 876) is expected to commence production in the second half of 2004. Devon has a 50% working interest in Redhawk and estimates net production at about 10,000 Boe per day. Magnolia (Garden Banks 783) is expected to commence production near year end 2004. Devon has a 25% working interest in this project. Net production is estimated at between 9,000 and 12,000 Boe per day. In the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, Devon drilled two exploratory discovery wells in 2003. The Sturgis well (Atwater Valley 182) found more than 100 net feet of oil pay sands. Sturgis, in 3,700 feet of water, was the second well in Devons four well joint venture with ChevronTexaco. Upon completion of the fourth well, Devon will earn a 25% working interest in 71 deepwater blocks. The fourth well is planned for early 2004. The second deepwater discovery in 2003 was at St. Malo (Walker Ridge 678). St. Malo, in 6,900 feet of water, encountered more than 450 net feet of oil pay. St. Malo and the previously announced Cascade discovery (Walker Ridge 206) are located in the lower Tertiary trend. Based on early evidence, the lower Tertiary trend may hold significant reserve potential. Devon plans to drill appraisal wells to better define the St. Malo and Cascade discoveries in the first half of 2004. Devon also plans to drill an appraisal well to the Sturgis discovery and additional lower Tertiary exploratory wells during 2004. In 2003, Devon had a notable shelf discovery on its Grays prospect (Galveston block 424). Three producing wells from this discovery were brought on production in early 2004 at approximately 27 MMcf per day net to Devons interest. The federal government is encouraging Gulf of Mexico operators to drill deep shelf wells, wells drilled on the shelf to a depth greater than 15,000 feet, through a reduced royalty incentive program. Devon plans to drill 10 to 12 deep shelf wells in 2004. Canada Devon is among the largest independent oil and gas producers in Canada and operates in most of the producing basins in Western Canada. As of December 31, 2003, 28% of Devons proved reserves were Canadian. Many of the Canadian basins where Devon operates are accessible for drilling only in the winter when the ground is frozen. Consequently, the winter season, from December through March, is the most active drilling period. Devon expects to drill about 400 wells in the 2003 2004 winter program and spend $360 million, or nearly half of the full year Canadian capital budget. The winter drilling is focused on three major areas: the Deep Basin, Northeastern British Columbia and the Northern Plains of Alberta. In the Deep Basin, plans call for 106 wells compared with 71 wells last winter. In Northeastern B.C., 93 wells are planned, compared with 73 the previous winter. In the Northern Plains, we expect to drill more than 100 wells this winter, compared with 76 wells a year ago. The Anderson acquisition in 2001 significantly strengthened Devons holdings in the Deep Basin of Western Alberta. Devon had sought for years to obtain a significant acreage position in the Deep Basin, but other operators, including Anderson, already controlled most of the acreage. As a result of the Anderson acquisition, Devon now holds over 800,000 net acres in the Deep Basin. The profitability of Devons operations in the Deep Basin is enhanced by its ownership in nine gas processing plants in the area. Devon plans to drill about 193 total wells in the Deep Basin in 2004. Deep Basin reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids, producing up to 100 barrels of NGLs with each MMcf of gas. In 2002, Devon commenced production from the first of several wells it has drilled in the Grizzly Valley area of the Foothills Region of Northeastern British Columbia. Due to gas pipeline and processing limitations, initial production was limited to about 10 MMcf of gas per day. However, a pipeline extension completed in 2003 allowed Devon to increase production from this area to about 30 MMcf per day. With 20 Table of Contents the pipeline extension complete, Devon can continue to tie in additional wells in the area. Net production from the entire Foothills region is approximately 130 MMcf of gas per day. Devon also acquired from Anderson approximately 1.5 million net acres in the MacKenzie Delta region and the shallow waters of the Beaufort Sea in Northern Canada. In 2002, a Devon well in the MacKenzie Delta encountered over 110 feet of natural gas pay. Production of this gas awaits an export pipeline to markets in Canada and the United States. Various industry proposals suggest that a pipeline could be built later in the decade. Devon also drills for and produces cold flow heavy oil in the Lloydminster area of Alberta and Saskatchewan where oil is found in multiple horizons generally at depths of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. In 2003, Devon drilled 263 wells in the Lloydminster area. Average net daily production from the area is approximately 34 MMcf of natural gas and 13,300 Bbls of crude oil. Devon also owns a 13% working interest in the ConocoPhillips operated Surmont thermal heavy oil project. Surmont, located north of Jackfish, is designed to produce up to 100,000 barrels of heavy oil per day by 2012. Surmont will also apply SAGD recovery technology. International The Ocean merger more than doubled Devons oil and gas reserves outside North America. At December 31, 2003, these international countries accounted for 15% of Devons worldwide proved reserves. Most significant was Oceans 24% working interest in the Exxon Mobil operated Zafiro field, offshore Equatorial Guinea in West Africa. During 2003, production from Zafiro increased significantly due to the addition of the Southern Expansion Area (SEA) in July. Production from the SEA increased total field capacity to 300,000 barrels of oil per day. Devons net share increased by about 15,000 barrels to more than 50,000 barrels per day. Devons production from Zafiro is expected to decline by about 7,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2004. The decline will occur when Devon reaches payout of a portion of its investment in the project and the governments share of production increases. Devon experienced another boost in international production in 2003 when its Panyu project offshore China commenced production late in the year. Panyu, in the Pearl River Mouth of the South China Sea, was discovered in 1998. In early 2004, production from the first eight of 27 planned wells reached 50,000 barrels per day. Devon has a 24.5% working interest in the project and expects its share of production to average about 16,000 barrels per day in 2004. In Azerbaijan in the Caspian Sea, Devon has a 5.6% carried working interest in the Azeri Chirag Gunashli, or ACG, oil development project. Devon estimates that the ACG field contains over 4.6 billion barrels of gross proved oil reserves. Oil production from the ACG field will increase dramatically upon completion of the Baku TBilisi Ceyhan pipeline, which is planned for 2005. Devons net share is expected to peak at about 50,000 barrels per day in 2008 or 2009. Devon also acquired minor producing properties in the Ocean merger in Cote dIvoire, Egypt, Indonesia and Russia. Ocean also held exploratory blocks in Angola, Brazil, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria and Syria. Devon plans to drill exploratory wells in each of the aforementioned countries, except Cote dIvoire and Indonesia, in 2004. Devon also produces oil and holds exploratory blocks in Gabon. Title to Properties Title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry, liens for current taxes not yet due and, in some instances, other encumbrances. Devon believes that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business. As is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties, little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition (other than a preliminary review of local records). Investigations, 21 Table of Contents generally including a title opinion of outside counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Royalty Matters Numerous gas producers and related parties, including Devon, have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the producers and related parties used below market prices, improper deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and sold from federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. The principal suit in which Devon is a defendant is United States ex rel. Wright v. Chevron USA, Inc. et al. (the Wright case). The suit was originally filed in August 1996 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, but was consolidated in October 2000 with the other suits for pre trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. On July 10, 2003, the District of Wyoming remanded the Wright case back to the Eastern District of Texas to resume proceedings. Devon believes that it has acted reasonably, has legitimate and strong defenses to all allegations in the suit, and has paid royalties in good faith. Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this lawsuit and no liability has been recorded in connection therewith. Devon is a defendant in certain private royalty owner litigation filed in Wyoming regarding deductibility of certain post production costs from royalties payable by Devon. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits propose to expand them into county or state wide class actions relating specifically to transportation and related costs associated with Devons Wyoming gas production. A significant portion of such production is, or will be, transported through facilities owned by Thunder Creek Gas Services, L.L.C., of which Devon owns a 75% interest. Devon believes that it has acted reasonably and paid royalties in good faith and in accordance with its obligations under its oil and gas leases and applicable law, and Devon does not believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this litigation. Tax Treatment of Exchangeable Debentures As described more fully in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, Devon has certain exchangeable debentures, with a principal amount totaling $760 million, which are exchangeable at the option of the holders into shares of ChevronTexaco common stock owned by Devon. The debentures were assumed, and the ChevronTexaco common stock was acquired, by Devon in the 1999 PennzEnergy merger. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the 1998 income tax return of PennzEnergys predecessor. In draft notices, the IRS has disagreed with certain tax treatments of the exchangeable debentures and similar exchangeable debentures retired in 1998. The IRS has not yet formally asserted a claim for additional taxes for 1998 related to the exchangeable debentures, but Devon believes it is probable that such an assertion will eventually be made. Based upon the draft notices received from the IRS, Devon estimates that if the IRS formally asserts a claim for additional taxes for 1998 as a result of its current examination, the amount of such claim would approximate $68 million. Devon does not agree with the positions that have been taken by the IRS in its draft documents, and will vigorously contest any claim of additional taxes. Although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty, Devon, after consultation with legal counsel, believes that if the IRS formally asserts a claim for additional taxes regarding the treatment of the exchangeable debentures, Devon would likely prevail. Even if the IRS prevailed in this matter, Devon believes that any related increase in its 1998 taxable income would increase its tax basis in the ChevronTexaco common stock, or produce a similar tax benefit, and would therefore result in offsetting tax deductions in future taxable years upon the disposal of the ChevronTexaco common stock. Therefore, while the payment of any such additional taxes would 22 Table of Contents reduce Devons operating cash flow in the year of payment, it would not affect Devons net earnings for any period, and the operating cash flow effect would reverse in future years. If the IRS ultimately prevailed in this matter, any interest owed by Devon on such additional taxes would negatively impact Devons operating cash flow and net earnings. However, Devon does not believe that such impact would be material to Devons financial condition or results of operations. Other Matters Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings incidental to its business. However, to Devons knowledge as of the date of this report, there were no other material pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which any of its property is subject. Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2003. 23 Table of Contents PART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Price Devons common stock has been traded on the American Stock Exchange (the AMEX) since September 29, 1988. Prior to September 29, 1988, Devons common stock was privately held. Commencing on December 15, 1998, a new class of Devon exchangeable shares began trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) under the symbol NSX. These shares are essentially equivalent to Devon common stock. However, because they are issued by Devons wholly owned subsidiary, Northstar, they qualify as a domestic Canadian investment for Canadian shareholders. They are exchangeable at any time, on a one for one basis, for common shares of Devon at the holders option. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for Devon common stock and exchangeable shares as reported by the AMEX and TSE for the periods indicated.

Effective December 31, 1996, Devon increased its quarterly dividend payment to $0.05 per share. Effective March 31, 2004, Devon increased its quarterly dividend payment to $0.10 per share. Devon anticipates continuing to pay regular quarterly dividends in the foreseeable future. Dividends are also paid on the exchangeable shares at the same rate and on the same dates as dividends paid on the common stock. On February 29, 2004, there were 21,341 holders of record of Devon common stock and 578 holders of record for the exchangeable shares. 24 Table of Contents Item 6.

This accounting method required Devon to report the results of both companies as if they had always been combined. Therefore, the cash dividends per share presented through 2000 are not representative of the actual amounts paid by Devon on a historical basis. For the years 1999 and 2000, Devons historical cash dividends per share were $0.20 in each year. (2) For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges and the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends, (i) earnings consist of earnings before income taxes, plus fixed charges; (ii) fixed charges consist of interest expense, dividends on subsidiarys preferred stock, distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trust, amortization of costs relating to indebtedness and the preferred securities of subsidiary trust, and one third of rental expense estimated to be attributable to interest; and (iii) preferred stock dividends consist of the amount of pre tax earnings required to pay dividends on the outstanding preferred stock. For the years 2002 and 1999, earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by $135 million and $264 million, respectively. 26 Table of Contents For the years 2002 and 1999, earnings were insufficient to cover combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends by $151 million and $270 million, respectively. (3) The preceding production, price and other data exclude the amounts related to discontinued operations for all periods presented. The preceding price data includes the effect of hedges. (4) Gas volumes are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf of gas per barrel of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of natural gas and oil, which rate is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of oil and gas prices. NGL volumes are converted to Boe on a one to one basis with oil. The respective prices of oil, gas and NGLs are affected by market and other factors in addition to relative energy content. Item 7.

(2) Net refers to gross acres multiplied by Devons fractional working interests therein. Operation of Properties The day to day operation of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements. The operator supervises production, maintains production records, employs field personnel and performs other functions. The charges under operating agreements customarily vary with the depth and location of the well being operated. Devon is the operator of 18,037 of its wells. As operator, Devon receives reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of its duties as well as monthly per well producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area. In presenting its financial data, Devon records the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense, which is a common industry practice. Organization Structure Devons North American properties are concentrated within five geographic areas. Operations in the United States are focused in the Permian Basin, the Mid Continent, the Rocky Mountains and onshore and offshore Gulf Coast regions. Canadian operations are focused in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta and British Columbia. Operations outside North America currently include Azerbaijan, Brazil, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Russia, Syria, and areas in West Africa, including Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Cote dIvoire, Nigeria and Angola. Maintaining a tight geographic focus in selected core areas has allowed Devon to improve operating and capital efficiency. The following table sets forth proved reserve information on the most significant geographic areas in which Devons properties are located as of December 31, 2003.

(6) Canadian dollars converted to U.S. dollars at the rate of $1 Canadian: $0.7738 U.S. United States Permian Basin Devons Permian Basin assets are located in portions of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. These assets include conventional oil and gas properties from a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths. The Permian Basin represented 8% of Devons proved reserves at December 31, 2003. Devons leasehold position in Southeast New Mexico encompasses more than 102,000 acres of developed lands and 237,000 acres of undeveloped land and minerals. Historically, Devon has been a very active operator in this area developing gas from the high productivity Morrow formation and oil in the lower risk Delaware formation. In the West Texas area of the Permian Basin, Devon maintains a base of oil production with long life reserves. Many of these reserves are from both operated and non operated positions in large enhanced oil recovery units such as the Wasson ODC Unit, the Willard Unit, the Reeves Unit, the North Welch Unit and the Anton Irish (Clearfork) Unit. These oil producing units often exhibit low decline rates. Devon also owns a significant acreage position in West Texas with over 194,000 acres of developed lands and over 224,000 acres of undeveloped land and minerals at December 31, 2003. Mid Continent The Mid Continent region includes portions of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. These areas encompass a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths and produce both oil and natural gas. Devons Mid Continent production has historically come from conventional oil and gas properties. However, the Barnett Shale, acquired in our 2002 merger with Mitchell Energy, is a non conventional gas resource. The Mid Continent region represented 19% of Devons proved reserves at December 31, 2003. Approximately 76% of Devons proved reserves in the Mid Continent area are in the Barnett Shale. The Barnett Shale, Devons largest producing field, is known as a tight gas formation. This means that, in its natural state, the formation is resistant to the production of natural gas. Mitchell spent decades understanding how to efficiently develop and produce this gas. The resulting technology has yielded a low risk and highly profitable natural gas operation. Devon holds 525,000 net acres and nearly 1,600 producing wells in the Barnett Shale. Devons average working interest is approximately 95%. Devon has experienced success extracting gas from the Barnett Shale by using light sand fracturing. Light sand fracturing yields better results than earlier techniques, is less expensive and can be used to complete new wells and to refracture existing wells. Refractured wells often exceed their original flow rates. Devon is also applying horizontal drilling and closer well spacing to further enhance the value of the Barnett Shale. Devons marketing and midstream operations transport and process its Barnett Shale production along with Barnett Shale production from unrelated third parties. The transport system consists of approximately 3,100 miles of pipeline, a 650 MMcf per day gas processing plant, and a 15,000 Bbls per day NGL fractionator. In 2004, Devon plans to drill a total of 192 new Barnett Shale wells including 94 horizontals and 98 verticals. More than half of the horizontal wells will be drilled outside the core development area in an 18 Table of Contents effort to further expand the productive area of the field. The Barnett Shale is expected to continue to be an important producing area for Devon for the foreseeable future. Current production from the Barnett Shale is approximately 428 MMcf and 24,100 Bbls of oil and NGLs per day net. Rocky Mountains Devons operations in the Rocky Mountain region include properties in Wyoming, Montana, Utah, and Northern New Mexico. These assets include conventional oil and gas properties and coalbed methane projects. As of December 31, 2003, the Rocky Mountain region comprised 9% of Devons proved reserves. Approximately 38% of Devons proved reserves in the Rocky Mountains are from coalbed methane. Devon began producing coalbed methane in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico in the mid 1980s and began drilling coalbed methane wells in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming in 1998. As of December 31, 2003, Devon has drilled 1,600 coalbed methane wells in the Powder River Basin. Devons net coalbed methane gas production from the basin was approximately 88 MMcf per day as of December 31, 2003, and Devon plans to drill 110 new wells in the Powder River Basin in 2004. Current production in the basin is primarily from the Wyodak coal formation. Development of the deeper Big George formation could significantly expand the coalbed methane play into the western portion of the Powder River Basin. The recently approved federal Environmental Impact Statement should facilitate development of the deeper formation. Eighty five of the wells planned in 2004 target these deeper coals. Devons most significant conventional gas project in the Rocky Mountains region is the Washakie field in Wyoming. Devon is continuing to develop and grow production from this field. In 2003, Devon drilled 38 wells and plans to drill another 40 wells in 2004. Devon has interests in over 200,000 acres. Devons current net production from Washakie is approximately 81 MMcf and 1,000 Bbls of oil and NGLs per day. Gulf Coast Devons Gulf Coast properties are located in South and East Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Most of the wells in the region are completed in conventional sandstone formations. At December 31, 2003, the Gulf Coast accounted for approximately 10% of Devons proved reserves. Devons operations in South Texas have focused on exploration in the Edwards, Wilcox and Frio/ Vicksburg formations. Devon has high working interests, up to 100%, in several producing fields. East Texas is an important conventional gas producing region for Devon. Carthage/ Bethany and Groesbeck are two of the primary producing areas. Wells produce from the Cotton Valley sands, the Travis Peak sands and from shallower sands and carbonates. Devon operates over 1,300 producing wells in East Texas and is currently employing a five rig drilling and recompletion program to continue low risk, infill development throughout the area. Devons current net production from east Texas is about 187 MMcf and 8,000 Bbls of oil and NGLs per day. Gulf of Mexico The offshore Gulf of Mexico accounted for 17% of Devons 2003 production and 11% of year end proved reserves. Devon is among the largest independent oil and gas producers in the Gulf of Mexico and operates 450 platforms and caissons. The 2003 merger with Ocean more than tripled Devons Gulf reserves. Gulf of Mexico operations are typically differentiated by water depth. The shelf is defined by water depths of 600 feet or less. The deepwater is at depths beyond 600 feet. Devon has active development and drilling programs ongoing in both the shelf and deepwater areas. In the Ocean merger, Devon acquired interests in the Nansen/ Boomvang complex in the East Breaks area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Devon acquired a 50% working interest in the Nansen field and a 20% interest in the Boomvang field. Ocean established oil and natural gas production at Nansen/ Boomvang in 2002. The Nansen and Boomvang production spars have a combined daily production 19 Table of Contents capacity of 80,000 Bbls of oil and 400 MMcf of gas. Devons share of current production from the fields is about 21,000 Bbls of oil and 120 MMcf of gas per day. Ocean had two additional deepwater development projects under construction in 2003. Redhawk (Garden Banks 876) is expected to commence production in the second half of 2004. Devon has a 50% working interest in Redhawk and estimates net production at about 10,000 Boe per day. Magnolia (Garden Banks 783) is expected to commence production near year end 2004. Devon has a 25% working interest in this project. Net production is estimated at between 9,000 and 12,000 Boe per day. In the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, Devon drilled two exploratory discovery wells in 2003. The Sturgis well (Atwater Valley 182) found more than 100 net feet of oil pay sands. Sturgis, in 3,700 feet of water, was the second well in Devons four well joint venture with ChevronTexaco. Upon completion of the fourth well, Devon will earn a 25% working interest in 71 deepwater blocks. The fourth well is planned for early 2004. The second deepwater discovery in 2003 was at St. Malo (Walker Ridge 678). St. Malo, in 6,900 feet of water, encountered more than 450 net feet of oil pay. St. Malo and the previously announced Cascade discovery (Walker Ridge 206) are located in the lower Tertiary trend. Based on early evidence, the lower Tertiary trend may hold significant reserve potential. Devon plans to drill appraisal wells to better define the St. Malo and Cascade discoveries in the first half of 2004. Devon also plans to drill an appraisal well to the Sturgis discovery and additional lower Tertiary exploratory wells during 2004. In 2003, Devon had a notable shelf discovery on its Grays prospect (Galveston block 424). Three producing wells from this discovery were brought on production in early 2004 at approximately 27 MMcf per day net to Devons interest. The federal government is encouraging Gulf of Mexico operators to drill deep shelf wells, wells drilled on the shelf to a depth greater than 15,000 feet, through a reduced royalty incentive program. Devon plans to drill 10 to 12 deep shelf wells in 2004. Canada Devon is among the largest independent oil and gas producers in Canada and operates in most of the producing basins in Western Canada. As of December 31, 2003, 28% of Devons proved reserves were Canadian. Many of the Canadian basins where Devon operates are accessible for drilling only in the winter when the ground is frozen. Consequently, the winter season, from December through March, is the most active drilling period. Devon expects to drill about 400 wells in the 2003 2004 winter program and spend $360 million, or nearly half of the full year Canadian capital budget. The winter drilling is focused on three major areas: the Deep Basin, Northeastern British Columbia and the Northern Plains of Alberta. In the Deep Basin, plans call for 106 wells compared with 71 wells last winter. In Northeastern B.C., 93 wells are planned, compared with 73 the previous winter. In the Northern Plains, we expect to drill more than 100 wells this winter, compared with 76 wells a year ago. The Anderson acquisition in 2001 significantly strengthened Devons holdings in the Deep Basin of Western Alberta. Devon had sought for years to obtain a significant acreage position in the Deep Basin, but other operators, including Anderson, already controlled most of the acreage. As a result of the Anderson acquisition, Devon now holds over 800,000 net acres in the Deep Basin. The profitability of Devons operations in the Deep Basin is enhanced by its ownership in nine gas processing plants in the area. Devon plans to drill about 193 total wells in the Deep Basin in 2004. Deep Basin reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids, producing up to 100 barrels of NGLs with each MMcf of gas. In 2002, Devon commenced production from the first of several wells it has drilled in the Grizzly Valley area of the Foothills Region of Northeastern British Columbia. Due to gas pipeline and processing limitations, initial production was limited to about 10 MMcf of gas per day. However, a pipeline extension completed in 2003 allowed Devon to increase production from this area to about 30 MMcf per day. With 20 Table of Contents the pipeline extension complete, Devon can continue to tie in additional wells in the area. Net production from the entire Foothills region is approximately 130 MMcf of gas per day. Devon also acquired from Anderson approximately 1.5 million net acres in the MacKenzie Delta region and the shallow waters of the Beaufort Sea in Northern Canada. In 2002, a Devon well in the MacKenzie Delta encountered over 110 feet of natural gas pay. Production of this gas awaits an export pipeline to markets in Canada and the United States. Various industry proposals suggest that a pipeline could be built later in the decade. Devon also drills for and produces cold flow heavy oil in the Lloydminster area of Alberta and Saskatchewan where oil is found in multiple horizons generally at depths of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. In 2003, Devon drilled 263 wells in the Lloydminster area. Average net daily production from the area is approximately 34 MMcf of natural gas and 13,300 Bbls of crude oil. Devon also owns a 13% working interest in the ConocoPhillips operated Surmont thermal heavy oil project. Surmont, located north of Jackfish, is designed to produce up to 100,000 barrels of heavy oil per day by 2012. Surmont will also apply SAGD recovery technology. International The Ocean merger more than doubled Devons oil and gas reserves outside North America. At December 31, 2003, these international countries accounted for 15% of Devons worldwide proved reserves. Most significant was Oceans 24% working interest in the Exxon Mobil operated Zafiro field, offshore Equatorial Guinea in West Africa. During 2003, production from Zafiro increased significantly due to the addition of the Southern Expansion Area (SEA) in July. Production from the SEA increased total field capacity to 300,000 barrels of oil per day. Devons net share increased by about 15,000 barrels to more than 50,000 barrels per day. Devons production from Zafiro is expected to decline by about 7,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2004. The decline will occur when Devon reaches payout of a portion of its investment in the project and the governments share of production increases. Devon experienced another boost in international production in 2003 when its Panyu project offshore China commenced production late in the year. Panyu, in the Pearl River Mouth of the South China Sea, was discovered in 1998. In early 2004, production from the first eight of 27 planned wells reached 50,000 barrels per day. Devon has a 24.5% working interest in the project and expects its share of production to average about 16,000 barrels per day in 2004. In Azerbaijan in the Caspian Sea, Devon has a 5.6% carried working interest in the Azeri Chirag Gunashli, or ACG, oil development project. Devon estimates that the ACG field contains over 4.6 billion barrels of gross proved oil reserves. Oil production from the ACG field will increase dramatically upon completion of the Baku TBilisi Ceyhan pipeline, which is planned for 2005. Devons net share is expected to peak at about 50,000 barrels per day in 2008 or 2009. Devon also acquired minor producing properties in the Ocean merger in Cote dIvoire, Egypt, Indonesia and Russia. Ocean also held exploratory blocks in Angola, Brazil, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria and Syria. Devon plans to drill exploratory wells in each of the aforementioned countries, except Cote dIvoire and Indonesia, in 2004. Devon also produces oil and holds exploratory blocks in Gabon. Title to Properties Title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry, liens for current taxes not yet due and, in some instances, other encumbrances. Devon believes that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business. As is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties, little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition (other than a preliminary review of local records). Investigations, 21 Table of Contents generally including a title opinion of outside counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Royalty Matters Numerous gas producers and related parties, including Devon, have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the producers and related parties used below market prices, improper deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and sold from federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. The principal suit in which Devon is a defendant is United States ex rel. Wright v. Chevron USA, Inc. et al. (the Wright case). The suit was originally filed in August 1996 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, but was consolidated in October 2000 with the other suits for pre trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. On July 10, 2003, the District of Wyoming remanded the Wright case back to the Eastern District of Texas to resume proceedings. Devon believes that it has acted reasonably, has legitimate and strong defenses to all allegations in the suit, and has paid royalties in good faith. Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this lawsuit and no liability has been recorded in connection therewith. Devon is a defendant in certain private royalty owner litigation filed in Wyoming regarding deductibility of certain post production costs from royalties payable by Devon. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits propose to expand them into county or state wide class actions relating specifically to transportation and related costs associated with Devons Wyoming gas production. A significant portion of such production is, or will be, transported through facilities owned by Thunder Creek Gas Services, L.L.C., of which Devon owns a 75% interest. Devon believes that it has acted reasonably and paid royalties in good faith and in accordance with its obligations under its oil and gas leases and applicable law, and Devon does not believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this litigation. Tax Treatment of Exchangeable Debentures As described more fully in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, Devon has certain exchangeable debentures, with a principal amount totaling $760 million, which are exchangeable at the option of the holders into shares of ChevronTexaco common stock owned by Devon. The debentures were assumed, and the ChevronTexaco common stock was acquired, by Devon in the 1999 PennzEnergy merger. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the 1998 income tax return of PennzEnergys predecessor. In draft notices, the IRS has disagreed with certain tax treatments of the exchangeable debentures and similar exchangeable debentures retired in 1998. The IRS has not yet formally asserted a claim for additional taxes for 1998 related to the exchangeable debentures, but Devon believes it is probable that such an assertion will eventually be made. Based upon the draft notices received from the IRS, Devon estimates that if the IRS formally asserts a claim for additional taxes for 1998 as a result of its current examination, the amount of such claim would approximate $68 million. Devon does not agree with the positions that have been taken by the IRS in its draft documents, and will vigorously contest any claim of additional taxes. Although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty, Devon, after consultation with legal counsel, believes that if the IRS formally asserts a claim for additional taxes regarding the treatment of the exchangeable debentures, Devon would likely prevail. Even if the IRS prevailed in this matter, Devon believes that any related increase in its 1998 taxable income would increase its tax basis in the ChevronTexaco common stock, or produce a similar tax benefit, and would therefore result in offsetting tax deductions in future taxable years upon the disposal of the ChevronTexaco common stock. Therefore, while the payment of any such additional taxes would 22 Table of Contents reduce Devons operating cash flow in the year of payment, it would not affect Devons net earnings for any period, and the operating cash flow effect would reverse in future years. If the IRS ultimately prevailed in this matter, any interest owed by Devon on such additional taxes would negatively impact Devons operating cash flow and net earnings. However, Devon does not believe that such impact would be material to Devons financial condition or results of operations. Other Matters Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings incidental to its business. However, to Devons knowledge as of the date of this report, there were no other material pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which any of its property is subject. Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2003. 23 Table of Contents PART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Price Devons common stock has been traded on the American Stock Exchange (the AMEX) since September 29, 1988. Prior to September 29, 1988, Devons common stock was privately held. Commencing on December 15, 1998, a new class of Devon exchangeable shares began trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) under the symbol NSX. These shares are essentially equivalent to Devon common stock. However, because they are issued by Devons wholly owned subsidiary, Northstar, they qualify as a domestic Canadian investment for Canadian shareholders. They are exchangeable at any time, on a one for one basis, for common shares of Devon at the holders option. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for Devon common stock and exchangeable shares as reported by the AMEX and TSE for the periods indicated.

Effective December 31, 1996, Devon increased its quarterly dividend payment to $0.05 per share. Effective March 31, 2004, Devon increased its quarterly dividend payment to $0.10 per share. Devon anticipates continuing to pay regular quarterly dividends in the foreseeable future. Dividends are also paid on the exchangeable shares at the same rate and on the same dates as dividends paid on the common stock. On February 29, 2004, there were 21,341 holders of record of Devon common stock and 578 holders of record for the exchangeable shares. 24 Table of Contents Item 6.
