Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", contains forward looking statements about circumstances that have not yet occurred. All statements, trend analysis and other information contained below relating to markets, our products and trends in revenue, as well as other statements including words such as "anticipate", "believe" or "expect" and statements in the future tense are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and actual events or our actual future results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements due to such risks and uncertainties. We will not necessarily update information if any forward looking statement later turns out to be inaccurate. Risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results and performance include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" at pages 45 to 50 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and their application places the most significant demands on managements judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, management cautions that actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Sales allowances and bad debt reserves We derive revenues from sales of our packaged goods product, subscriptions of online service, sales of packaged goods through our online store and website advertising. Product revenue is recognized net of an allowance for returns. We also have stock balancing programs for our personal computer products that, under certain circumstances and up to a specified amount, allow for the exchange of personal computer products by resellers. We may decide to provide price protection under certain circumstances for our personal computer and video game system products after we analyze: inventory remaining in the channel, the rate of inventory sell through in the channel, and our remaining inventory on hand. We maintain a policy of exchanging products or giving credits, but do not give cash refunds. We estimate potential future product returns, price protection and stock balancing programs related to current period product revenue. We analyze historical returns, current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products, current trends in the video game market and the overall economy, changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and price protection allowances. In addition, management monitors and manages the volume of our sales to retailers and distributors and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel can result in high returns or the requirement for substantial price protection in subsequent periods. In the past, actual returns have not generally exceeded our reserves. However, actual returns in any future period are inherently uncertain as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. For example, the risk of product returns for our products on mature platforms may increase as new hardware platforms, such as Xbox, Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2, become more popular. While management believes it can make reliable estimates for these matters, if we changed our assumptions and estimates, our returns reserves would change, which would impact the net revenue we report. In addition, if actual returns were significantly greater than the reserves we have established, the actual results would decrease our reported revenue. Conversely, if actual returns were significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our reported revenue. Similarly, management must use significant judgment and make estimates in connection with establishing allowances for doubtful accounts in any accounting period. Management analyzes customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our bad debt expense for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates. If our customers experience financial difficulties and are not able to meet their ongoing financial obligations to us, our results of operations may be adversely impacted. For example, in January 2002, one of our retail customers, Kmart, declared bankruptcy. We have adequately reserved for our exposure to Kmart. Our distribution channels have been characterized by change, including consolidations and financial difficulties of certain distributors and retailers. 20 Our gross accounts receivable balance was $306,365,000 and our allowance for product returns, pricing allowances and doubtful accounts was $115,870,000 as of March 31, 2002. As of March 31, 2001, our gross accounts receivable balance was $264,282,000 and our allowance for product returns, pricing allowances and doubtful accounts was $89,833,000. Prepaid royalties Prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments for manufacturing royalties, co publishing and or distribution affiliates and license fees paid to celebrities, professional sports organizations and other organizations for use of their trade name and content. Also included in prepaid royalties are prepayments made to independent software developers under development arrangements that have alternative future uses. Prepaid royalties are expensed at the contractual or effective royalty rate as cost of goods sold based on actual net product sales. We evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties quarterly and charge to research and development expense any amounts that we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales. We rely on forecasted revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties. If actual revenues, or revised forecasted sales, fall below the initial forecasted sales, the charge to research and development expense may be larger than anticipated in any given quarter. Once the charge has been taken to research and development expense, that amount will not be expensed in future quarters when the product has shipped. The current portion of prepaid royalties, included in other current assets, was $65,484,000 at March 31, 2002 and $46,264,000 at March 31, 2001. The long term portion of prepaid royalties, included in other assets, was $1,164,000 at March 31, 2002 and $9,664,000 at March 31, 2001. Valuation of long lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets Under current accounting standards, we make judgments about the remaining useful lives of goodwill, purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet. In order to judge the remaining useful life of an asset, management makes various assumptions about the value of the asset in the future. This may include assumptions about future prospects for the business that the asset relates to and typically involves computations of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by these businesses. Please refer to the Operations by Segment discussion of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussions of EA Core and EA.com. For our EA Core division, our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play on proprietary video game platforms. The success of our products is affected by the ability to accurately predict which platforms and which products we develop will be successful. Also, our revenues and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules. For our EA.com division, the future net cash flows are dependent on the success of online games. Offering games solely for online play is a substantial departure from our traditional business of selling packaged software games. Because of our inexperience in predicting usage patterns for our games, we may not be effective in achieving success that may otherwise be attainable from offering our games online. Due to these and other factors described in our Risk Factors, we may not realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our long lived assets. For example, our product Majestic(TM) and our Platinum offering, which contained certain browser based entertainment games, were launched with a monthly subscription pricing model and obtained only limited commercial success. Accordingly, we did not realize our projected cash flows and discontinued these offerings as part of EA.coms restructuring plan. Based on these judgments and assumptions, management determines whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Judgments and assumptions about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including but not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business and significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results. Although we believe the judgments and assumptions management has made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, there is nonetheless a high degree of uncertainty and judgment involved. For example, as part of a restructuring plan to reduce EA.coms workforce and consolidate facilities in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002, we recorded impairment charges to write down certain of EA.coms depreciable assets and certain intangibles to their estimated fair value and to write off certain assets which were abandoned. The impairment charges were based on managements projections regarding the assets remaining useful lives and future values. The EA.com business is still in the growing stages, therefore evaluating its business and prospects is more difficult than would be the case for a more mature business. We continue to encounter the risks and difficulties faced with launching a new business. We continue to look for ways to streamline the business by consolidating systems and reducing infrastructure costs. Different judgments and assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results. More conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses would result in greater impairment charges, which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet. Conversely, less conservative assumptions would result in smaller impairment charges, higher net income and higher asset values. Impairment charges on long lived assets amounted to $12,818,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002. There were no impairment charges on long lived assets for the years ended March 31, 2001 and 2000. On April 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 ("SFAS 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", which supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 17 "Intangible Assets". As a result of adopting this standard, we will continue to amortize finite lived intangibles, but will no longer amortize certain other intangible assets, most notably goodwill 21 and acquired workforce, which had a net book value at March 31, 2002 of $69,050,000. Amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce totaled approximately $13,125,000 for fiscal 2002, approximately $9,182,000 for fiscal 2001 and approximately $6,411,000 for fiscal 2000. Based on intangible assets as of March 31, 2002, we estimate that amortization of finite lived intangibles will total approximately $8,700,000 for fiscal 2003. Following adoption of SFAS 142, we will continue to evaluate whether any event has occurred which might indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable. In addition, SFAS 142 requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. Income taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. To determine the quarterly tax rate, we are required to estimate full year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. The estimated effective tax rate is adjusted for the tax related to significant unusual items. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can effect the overall effective tax rate. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of Fiscal 2002 to 2001: Revenues We derive revenues primarily from shipments of entertainment software, which includes EA Studio products for dedicated entertainment systems (that we call video game systems or consoles such as PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube, and handheld systems such as Game Boy Advance), EA Studio personal computer products (or PC), Co Publishing products that are co published and distributed by us, and Affiliated Label (or AL) products that are published by third parties and distributed by us. We also derive revenues from licensing of EA Studio products and AL products through hardware companies (or OEM), selling subscriptions on our online gaming service, selling advertisements on our online web pages and selling our packaged goods through our online store. Information about our net revenues for North America and foreign areas for fiscal 2002 and 2001 is summarized below (in thousands): 2002 2001 Increase % change North America $ 1,093,244 $ 831,924 $ 261,320 31.4 % Europe 519,458 386,728 132,730 34.3 % Asia Pacific 53,376 51,039 2,337 4.6 % Japan 58,597 52,582 6,015 11.4 % International 631,431 490,349 141,082 28.8 % Consolidated Net Revenues $ 1,724,675 $1,322,273 $ 402,402 30.4 % North America Net Revenues The increase in North America net revenues for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily attributable to: ... A 111% increase in PlayStation 2 revenues for the year due to the shipment of key titles such as Madden NFL 2002, James Bond 007 in ...Agent Under Fire, NBA Street, NBA Live 2002 and SSX Tricky, a higher installed base of hardware and a strong catalogue business. PlayStation 2 launched in October 2000. Consequently, fiscal 2001 includes six months of revenues as compared to twelve months of revenues for the PlayStation 2 in fiscal 2002. ... The launch of the Xbox platform in North America in November 2001, which generated $73,609,000 in revenues from titles such as Madden NFL 2002, NBA Live 2002, James Bond 007 in...Agent Under Fire, NASCAR Thunder 2002, NHL 2002 and SSX Tricky. ... The launch of Nintendo GameCube in North America in November 2001, which generated $48,744,000 for the year from key titles such as Madden NFL 2002, James Bond 007 in...Agent Under Fire, SSX Tricky, NBA Street and FIFA Soccer 2002. 22 ... New revenues were generated by Game Boy Advance of $25,989,000 for the year from key titles including Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, Madden NFL and NHL 2002. Also, Game Boy Color generated new revenues of $16,870,000 for the year from titles such as Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, Madden NFL 2002 and The World Is Not Enough. ... Advertising revenues increased by $31,849,000 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2002 as we commenced generating advertising revenues immediately following the launch of our gamesite on the world wide web in October 2000. In addition, advertising revenues were generated from Pogo Corporations ("Pogo") websites subsequent to the February 2001 acquisition. ... These increases were partially offset by the continued expected decreases in Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64 ("N64") revenues due to those declining markets and fewer titles shipping compared to the same period in the prior year. International Net Revenues The increase in international net revenues for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was attributable to the following: ... Europes net revenues increased by 34% compared to the prior year primarily due to higher PlayStation 2, AL and PC sales, partially offset by the expected decrease of revenues from Sony PlayStation. PlayStation 2 launched in November 2000. Consequently, fiscal 2001 includes five months of revenues as compared to twelve months of revenues from the PlayStation 2 in fiscal 2002, resulting in an 80% increase in PlayStation 2 revenues. ... Asia Pacifics net revenues increased by 5% compared to the prior year primarily due to higher PlayStation 2, Game Boy Color and PC revenue, partially offset by the expected decrease in PlayStation and Nintendo 64 sales, and an unfavorable exchange rate comparison of approximately 10%. PlayStation 2 revenues increased by 46%, partially offset by a 34% decrease in PlayStation revenues in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. ... Japans net revenues increased by 11% compared to the prior year primarily due to higher AL revenue and revenue generated from sales of PlayStation, Nintendo GameCube and Xbox products, offset by the strong sales of our first PlayStation 2 title, FIFA Soccer World Championship, in the prior year and weakness in the Yen currency during fiscal 2002 resulting in a rate decrease of approximately 14% from fiscal 2001. Also, Japan did not benefit from our primary PlayStation 2 releases during the current fiscal year, which have more appeal to the North American market. PlayStation 2 revenues decreased by 50% in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. Information about our worldwide net revenues by product line for fiscal 2002 and 2001 is presented below (in thousands): Increase/ 2002 2001 (Decrease) % change EA Studio: PlayStation 2 $ 482,882 $ 258,988 $ 223,894 86.4 % PC 456,292 405,256 51,036 12.6 % PlayStation 189,535 309,988 (120,453) (38.9 %) Xbox 78,363 78,363 N/A Nintendo GameCube 51,740 51,740 N/A Game Boy Advance 43,653 43,653 N/A Game Boy Color 38,026 38,026 N/A Advertising 38,024 6,175 31,849 515.8 % Online Subscriptions 30,940 28,878 2,062 7.1 % License, OEM and Other 24,762 20,468 4,294 21.0 % N64 18,152 67,044 (48,892) (72.9 %) Online Packaged Goods 3,296 3,198 98 3.1 % 1,455,665 1,099,995 355,670 32.3 % Affiliated Label: 269,010 222,278 46,732 21.0 % Consolidated Net Revenues $ 1,724,675 $ 1,322,273 $ 402,402 30.4 % PlayStation 2 Product Net Revenues Revenues increased for the twelve months ended March 31, 2002 due to the higher installed base of PlayStation 2 hardware and more titles, including catalogue, available on the platform compared to the same period last year. Major releases for the fiscal year include titles such as Madden NFL 2002, James Bond 007 in .....Agent Under Fire, FIFA 2002, NBA Street, NBA Live 2002, NCAA Football 2002, SSX Tricky, NHL 2002 and NASCAR Thunder 2002. We released 18 PlayStation 2 titles in the current fiscal year compared to 15 in the same period last year. We expect revenues from PlayStation 2 products to continue to grow in fiscal 2003, but as revenues for these products increase, we do not expect to maintain these growth rates. 23 Personal Computer Product Net Revenues The increase in sales of PC products for the twelve months ended March 31, 2002 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the continued strong sales of The Sims, which shipped over two years ago. Key current year releases were Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, The Sims Hot Date Expansion Pack, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault(TM), Command & Conquer Renegade(TM) and Madden NFL 2002. We released 16 PC titles in the twelve months ended March 31, 2002 compared to 18 in the same period last year. The Sims continues to be the number one PC title and has now sold over six million copies. Due to the sales of The Sims in fiscal 2002, we expect revenues from PC products to be flat or lower in fiscal 2003. PlayStation Product Net Revenues We released five PlayStation titles in the twelve months ended March 31, 2002 compared to 17 titles in the same period last year. As expected, PlayStation sales decreased for the twelve months ended March 31, 2002 compared to the prior year primarily attributable to the transition to next generation console systems and fewer titles released for the product during the current year. Although our PlayStation products are playable on the PlayStation 2 console, we expect sales of current PlayStation products to continue to decline significantly in fiscal 2003. Under the terms of a licensing agreement entered into with Sony Computer Entertainment of America in July 1994 (the "Sony Agreement"), as amended, we are authorized to develop and distribute CD based software products compatible with the PlayStation. Furthermore, under the terms of an additional licensing agreement entered into with Sony Computer Entertainment of America as of April 2000 (the "PlayStation 2 Agreement"), as amended, we are authorized to develop and distribute DVD based software products compatible with the PlayStation 2. Pursuant to these agreements, we engage Sony to manufacture its PlayStation and PlayStation 2 CDs and DVDs for us. Accordingly, we have limited ability to control our supply of PlayStation and PlayStation 2 CD and DVD products or the timing of their delivery. Xbox Net Revenues Following the launch of the Xbox platform in North America in November 2001, we released our first ten Xbox titles during fiscal 2002. Titles released included Madden NFL 2002, NBA Live 2002, James Bond 007 in ... Agent Under Fire, NASCAR Thunder 2002, NHL 2002, Triple Play(TM) 2002, SSX Tricky, Knockout Kings 2002 and F1 2001. Nintendo GameCube Net Revenues We released our first five Nintendo GameCube titles, Madden NFL 2002, James Bond 007 in ...Agent Under Fire, SSX Tricky, NBA Street and FIFA Soccer 2002, during fiscal 2002 following the platforms launch in Japan in September 2001 and in North America in November 2001. Game Boy Advance Net Revenues We released our first three Game Boy Advance titles, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, Madden NFL 2002 and NHL 2002 during fiscal 2002. Game Boy Color Net Revenues We released three Game Boy Color titles, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, Madden NFL 2002 and The World is Not Enough during fiscal 2002. Advertising Revenues We commenced generating advertising revenues in the third quarter of fiscal year 2001 following the launch of our gamesite on the world wide web and the AOL Games Channel in October 2000. In addition, we generated advertising revenue from Pogos websites subsequent to the purchase of Pogo in February 2001. As a result of establishing our ad business in late fiscal 2001, we experienced significant revenue growth in fiscal 2002. Due to this and continuing uncertainties in the ad market, we will not be able to sustain the same annual growth rate as experienced in fiscal 2002. Online Subscription Net Revenues The increase in online revenues for fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily attributable to the following: ... An increase in the number of paying customers for Ultima Online to 207,000 as of March 31, 2002 as compared to 203,000 as of March 31, 2001. This increase was primarily due to the continued strong sales of Ultima Online Third Dawn and the release of Ultima Online Lord Blackthorns Revenge in February 2002. In addition, the launch of Motor City Online in October 2001, which contributed $1,500,000 in subscription revenues for fiscal 2002. 24 ... Offset by a decrease in subscription revenues of $5,000,000 for Gamestorm, Kesmai Corporation ("Kesmai") and Worldplay online games (most of which were transferred to our free service when the EA/AOL site went live in October 2000) in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. License, OEM and Other Revenues The increase in license, OEM and other revenues for the twelve months ended March 31, 2002 was primarily due to a new OEM agreement with a customer in Europe and higher revenues in North America. Nintendo 64 Product Net Revenues We released one N64 title in fiscal 2002 compared to three titles during fiscal 2001. The expected decrease in N64 revenues for the fiscal year, compared to the prior fiscal year, was primarily due to the declining market for N64 products and fewer titles released on this platform in the current fiscal year. We do not intend to release any new N64 products in fiscal 2003. Online Packaged Goods Net Revenues Online Packaged Goods revenues for fiscal 2002 were slightly higher than fiscal 2001 primarily due to the release of Motor City Online in October 2001. Affiliated Label Product Net Revenues AL product sales increased for fiscal 2002 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to strong sales of hit titles including Devil May Cry and Resident Evil: Code Veronica resulting from new distribution deals with Capcom as well as The Simpsons(TM) Road Rage in the current year. This was partially offset by lower revenues from shipment of Square EA products due to fewer titles released in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Operations by Segment Management considers EA.com to be a separate reportable segment. We operate in two principal business segments globally (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements): . EA Core business segment: creation, marketing and distribution of entertainment software. . EA.com business segment: creation, marketing and distribution of entertainment software which can be played or sold online, ongoing management of subscriptions of online games and website advertising. EA.com represents Electronic Arts online and e Commerce businesses. EA.coms business includes subscription revenues collected for Internet game play on our websites, website advertising, sales of packaged goods for Internet only based games and sales of Electronic Arts games sold through the EA.com web store. The Consolidated Statements of Operations includes all revenues and costs directly attributable to EA.com, including charges for shared facilities, functions and services used by EA.com and provided by EA Core. Certain costs and expenses have been allocated based on managements estimates of the cost of services provided to EA.com by EA Core. 25 Information about our operations by segment for fiscal 2002 and 2001 is presented below (in thousands): Year Ended March 31, 2002 EA Core Adjustments and (excl.

We expect research and development spending to increase in fiscal 2003 due to an increase in development spending for next generation console products including the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube, as well as extending our investment in the PC platform. Network Development and Support. Network development and support expenses increased in absolute dollars by 14.8% for fiscal 2002 primarily due to: ... Increased depreciation related to both hardware and internally developed software that began when the site went live in October 2000. ... Increased headcount and network related costs associated with Pogo. ... Partially offset by reduced consultant costs related to project and site enhancements. The expense run rate has been reduced as a result of the restructuring. We do not expect expenses to increase in fiscal 2003. Customer Relationship Management. Customer relationship management expenses decreased in absolute dollars by 6.7% for fiscal 2002 primarily due to headcount reductions in EA.com that occurred in October 2001 as part of the restructuring plan (see Charge for Restructuring and Impairment discussion below). 30 Amortization of Intangibles % of net % of net 2002 revenues 2001 revenues % change $25,418,000 1.5% $19,323,000 1.5% 31.5% The amortization of intangibles results primarily from the acquisitions of Westwood, Kesmai, DreamWorks Interactive, ABC Software, Pogo and other acquisitions. Amortization of intangibles was $12,888,000 for EA Core and $12,530,000 for EA.com for fiscal 2002. Amortization of intangibles was $12,829,000 for EA Core and $6,494,000 for EA.com for fiscal 2001. The increase in fiscal year 2002 for EA.com, compared to the prior year, was due to the acquisition of Pogo in February 2001. With the implementation of new accounting pronouncements (see Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards on page 43) as of April 2002, we will continue to amortize finite lived intangibles, but will no longer amortize goodwill and acquired workforce. Amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce totaled approximately $13,125,000 for fiscal 2002 and approximately $9,182,000 for fiscal 2001. Based on intangible assets as of March 31, 2002, we estimate that amortization of finite lived intangibles will total approximately $8,700,000 for fiscal 2003. Following adoption of SFAS 142, we will continue to evaluate whether any event has occurred which might indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable. In addition, SFAS 142 requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. We are in the process of completing an evaluation for impairment of goodwill in accordance with SFAS 142. We believe the implementation of SFAS 142 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Charge for Acquired In Process Technology % of net % of net 2002 revenues 2001 revenues % change $ N/A $2,719,000 0.2% (100.0%) In connection with the acquisition of Pogo in the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2001, we allocated and expensed $2,719,000 of the $43,333,000 purchase price to acquired in process technology. At the date of acquisition, this amount was expensed as a non recurring charge as the in process technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses. Pogo had various projects in progress at the time of the acquisition. As of the acquisition date, costs to complete Pogo projects acquired were expected to be approximately $1,200,000 in future periods. During fiscal 2002, all of these development projects were completed and launched on Pogo gamesites. In conjunction with the acquisition of Pogo, we accrued approximately $100,000 related to direct transaction and other related costs. This charge was made after we concluded that the in process technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use after taking into consideration the potential for usage of the software in different products and resale of the software. Charge for Restructuring and Impairment % of net % of net 2002 revenues 2001 revenues % change $20,303,000 1.2% $ N/A N/M During fiscal 2002, we announced a restructuring plan for EA.com to reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities. These restructuring and resulting asset impairment charges were necessary in order to focus on key online priorities and reduce EA.coms operating cost structure. A pre tax charge of $20,303,000 was recorded in fiscal 2002, consisting of $4,173,000 for workforce reductions, $3,312,000 for consolidation of facilities and other administrative charges and $12,818,000 for the write off of non current assets as a direct result of the restructuring. The pre tax charge of $20,303,000 consisted of $6,836,000 in cash outlays and $13,467,000 in non cash charges related to the write offs of non current assets and facilities. As of March 31, 2002, an aggregate of $4,016,000 in cash had been paid out under the restructuring plan. Of the remaining cash outlay of $2,820,000, $1,590,000 is expected to occur in fiscal 2003 while the remaining $1,230,000 related to future lease payments will occur is fiscal years 2004 and beyond. Adjustments to the restructuring reserves will be made in future periods, if necessary, based upon current events and circumstances. The restructuring plan resulted in the termination of approximately 270 personnel, or one third of EA.coms workforce, which affected all departments across the organization. The estimated costs for consolidation of facilities are comprised of contractual rental commitments under real estate leases for unutilized office space offset by estimated future sub lease income. Included in these costs 31 are estimated costs to close offices or consolidate facilities in various locations and costs to write off a portion of the assets from these facilities. In addition, the restructuring efforts required an evaluation of asset impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 ("SFAS 121"), "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of", to adjust these depreciable assets and certain intangibles to their estimated fair value. Management evaluated the impact of consolidating or abandoning certain EA.com technologies and processes and reviewed the effect of changes to EA.coms subscription product offerings in relation to EA.coms asset base. Impairment charges on long lived assets amounted to $12,818,000 and included $11,177,000 relating to consolidated or abandoned technologies for the EA.com infrastructure and $1,641,000 of goodwill and intangibles impairment charges relating to the EA.coms San Diego and Kesmai studios. There are no assurances that the impairment factors evaluated by management will not change in subsequent periods and accordingly, this could result in additional impairment charges in future periods. We will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of products, departments, technology and processes and look for ways to consolidate and streamline EA.com operations in an effort to further reduce operating expenses. Interest and Other Income, Net % of net % of net 2002 revenues 2001 revenues % change $12,848,000 0.7% $16,886,000 1.3% (23.9%) Interest and other income, net, decreased in absolute dollars by 23.9% primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates in the current year and an increase in the cost of utilizing foreign exchange hedge contracts. Income Taxes Effective Effective 2002 tax rate 2001 tax rate % change $45,969,000 31.0% $(4,163,000) 31.0% N/M Our effective tax rate was 31.0% for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001. At March 31, 2002, we generated a federal income tax net operating loss. This loss will be carried forward to future tax years. At March 31, 2001, we also generated a federal income tax net operating loss. A substantial portion of this loss was utilized in a carryback claim with the remainder being carried forward. The net operating losses for both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 resulted from losses from EA.coms operations as well as stock option deductions. A valuation allowance has not been established on these loss carryforwards or other net deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize them. Net Income (loss) % of net % of net 2002 revenues 2001 revenues % change $101,509,000 5.9% $(11,082,000) (0.8%) N/M In absolute dollars, reported net income (loss) increased in fiscal 2002 primarily related to higher net revenues, partially offset by higher expenses compared to the same period last year. The increase in expenses was primarily due to increases in marketing and advertising costs to support a higher number of franchise titles. In addition, higher expenses were due to the charge for restructuring and impairment in fiscal 2002. We believe the disclosure of pro forma net income (loss) and operating profit (loss), which does not include unusual events or transactions, such as restructuring and asset impairment costs and charge for acquired in process technology, and also excludes amortization of intangibles and non cash stock compensation charges, helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations. However, we urge investors to carefully review the GAAP financial information included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and compare GAAP financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Pro forma net income, excluding the items noted above, was $135,195,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002 and $5,995,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001. The increase in pro forma net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002 was due to higher revenues and gross profits as compared to the same periods last year. This was partially offset by an increase in marketing and sales expenses to support programs for key titles shipped in the current year. 32 With the implementation of new accounting pronouncements relating to goodwill and intangible assets (see Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards on page 43) as of April 2002, we will continue to amortize finite lived intangibles, but will no longer amortize goodwill and acquired workforce. Amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce totaled approximately $13,125,000 for fiscal 2002 and approximately $9,182,000 for fiscal 2001. Based on intangible assets as of March 31, 2002, we estimate that amortization of finite lived intangibles will total approximately $8,700,000 for fiscal 2003. Following adoption of SFAS 142, we will continue to evaluate whether any event has occurred which might indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable. In addition, SFAS 142 requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. We are in the process of completing an evaluation for impairment of goodwill in accordance with SFAS 142. We believe the implementation of SFAS 142 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Comparison of Fiscal 2001 to 2000: Revenues Information about our net revenues for North America and foreign areas for fiscal 2001 and 2000 is summarized below (in thousands): Increase/ 2001 2000 (Decrease) % change North America $ 831,924 $ 846,637 $ (14,713) (1.7 %) Europe 386,728 486,816 (100,088) (20.6 %) Asia Pacific 51,039 53,187 (2,148) (4.0 %) Japan 52,582 33,371 19,211 57.6 % International 490,349 573,374 (83,025) (14.5 %) Consolidated Net Revenues $1,322,273 $1,420,011 $ (97,738) (6.9 %) North America Net Revenues The decrease in North America net revenues for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily attributable to: ... Expected declines in sales of PlayStation and N64 titles due to the beginning of the transition to next generation consoles. PlayStation net revenues decreased 49% and N64 net revenues decreased 46% also due to fewer titles shipping in fiscal 2001 for both platforms. ... A 6% decrease in AL revenues primarily due to the acquisition of an affiliate, DreamWorks Interactive, by us in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. ... Offset partially by the launch of PlayStation 2 platform in North America which generated $171,034,000 in revenue for fiscal 2001 from titles such as Madden NFL 2001, SSX, NBA Live 2001 and NHL 2001. PlayStation 2 revenues in fiscal 2001 did not offset the decrease in PlayStation revenues due to a reduced number of hardware units reaching the market due to hardware component shortages, according to Sony. ... Offset by a 21% increase in PC revenues due to the shipment of key releases including Command & Conquer Red Alert(TM) 2 and The Sims: Livin Large and continued strong catalog sales of The Sims in fiscal 2001. International Net Revenues The decrease in international net revenues for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was attributable to the following: ... Europes net revenues decreased 21% primarily due to the console transition, lower AL sales due to product release slips and fewer hit titles released in fiscal 2001, lower PC sales with fewer titles shipping in fiscal 2001, the strong sales of Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun(TM) for the PC in fiscal 2000, and weakness in the Euro currency. In addition, PlayStation revenues decreased 43% due to fewer titles shipping during the console transition period in fiscal 2001 with most franchise titles showing significant decreases from fiscal 2000 releases. PlayStation 2 revenues did not offset the decrease in PlayStation revenues due to fewer hardware units reaching the market and the weighting of titles specifically appropriate for the North American market rather than the European market. ... Asia Pacifics net revenues decreased 4%, mainly due to the decrease in PlayStation revenues as there were no significant new titles released in fiscal 2001. This was offset by sales of PlayStation 2 titles such as SSX and FIFA 2001. ... Offset by Japans net revenues which increased 58% compared to fiscal 2000 primarily due to the shipment of PlayStation 2 titles such as FIFA Soccer World Championship, FIFA 2001 and SSX in fiscal 2001. 33 Information about our net revenues by product line for fiscal 2001 and 2000 is presented below (in thousands): Increase/ 2001 2000 (Decrease) % change EA Studio: PC $ 405,256 $ 395,522 $ 9,734 2.5 % PlayStation 309,988 586,821 (276,833) (47.2 %) PlayStation 2 258,988 258,988 N/A N64 67,044 120,415 (53,371) (44.3 %) Online Subscriptions 28,878 16,771 12,107 72.2 % Online Packaged Goods 3,198 2,255 943 41.8 % License, OEM and Other 20,468 22,894 (2,426) (10.6 %) Advertising 6,175 6,175 N/A 1,099,995 1,144,678 (44,683) (3.9 %) Affiliated Label: 222,278 275,333 (53,055) (19.3 %) Consolidated Net Revenues $ 1,322,273 $ 1,420,011 $ (97,738) (6.9 %) Personal Computer Product Net Revenues The increase in sales of PC products for fiscal 2001 was primarily attributable to the continued strong sales of The Sims, which shipped in fiscal 2000. Key fiscal 2001 releases were Command & Conquer Red Alert 2 and The Sims: Livin Large. We released 20 PC titles in fiscal 2001 compared to 31 titles in fiscal 2000. The Sims continued to be the number one PC title. PlayStation Product Net Revenues We released 17 PlayStation titles in fiscal 2001 compared to 30 in fiscal 2000. As expected, PlayStation sales decreased for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 primarily attributable to the PlayStation 2 platform transition. With the exception of Madden NFL, all of our franchises experienced significant decreases from fiscal 2000 releases. PlayStation 2 Product Net Revenues We released 15 titles worldwide in fiscal 2001 for the PlayStation 2. Key releases for fiscal 2001 included Madden NFL 2001, SSX, FIFA 2001, NBA Live 2001 and NHL 2001. Revenue was lower than expected due to the shortage of PlayStation 2 hardware in fiscal 2001 resulting from component shortages which limited the number of units that could be manufactured, according to Sony. Affiliated Label Product Net Revenues The decrease in Affiliated Label net revenues for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily due to the strong sales of Final Fantasy(R) VIII in fiscal 2000, our acquisition of DreamWorks Interactive, formerly an AL, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, fewer hit AL product releases and product release slips in Europe. N64 Product Net Revenues We released three N64 titles in fiscal 2001 compared to eight titles during fiscal 2000. The expected decrease in N64 revenues for fiscal 2001, compared to fiscal 2000, was primarily due to fewer releases. The decrease was also due to the weaker market for N64 products in fiscal 2001. The key release for fiscal 2001 was The World Is Not Enough. Online Net Revenues The increase in online revenues for fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 was attributable to the following: . The average number of paying customers for Ultima Online increased to approximately 200,000 for fiscal 2001 as compared to over 140,000 for fiscal 2000. This increase was due to continued strong sales of Ultima Online, the addition of new events and parties within the Ultima worlds and the release of Ultima Online Renaissance in April 2000. . We generated over $5,100,000 in subscription revenues for Kesmai and Worldplay online games for fiscal 2001. These products were not part of EA.com in fiscal 2000 due to the Kesmai acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. License, OEM and Other Revenues The decrease in license, OEM and other revenues for fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily a result of lower license revenue of certain titles on the Game Boy platform. 34 Advertising Following the launch of EA.com on the worldwide web and the AOL Games Channel in October 2000, we began selling advertising on EA.com and AOL properties, including the Slingo game. In addition, we generated advertising revenue from Pogos websites as a result of the purchase of Pogo in February 2001.

Our pro forma results do not include unusual events or transactions, such as restructuring and asset impairment costs and charge for acquired in process technology, and also excludes amortization of intangibles and non cash stock compensation charges. In addition, income taxes are allocated to EA Core and EA.com at the consolidated effective tax rate (31%) on a pro rata basis. We believe the disclosure of the pro forma net income (loss) and operating profit (loss), which excludes the items noted in the table below, helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations. However, we urge investors to carefully review the GAAP financial information included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and compare GAAP financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10 K.

Research and development expenses (excluding Network Development and Support and Customer Relationship Management) increased in absolute dollars by 35.4% for fiscal 2001, primarily attributed to: ... Increase in research and development expenses by EA.com (including expenses incurred by EA Core on behalf of EA.com) due to an increase in the number of online projects in development and increased development staff to support these products. ... An increase in development spending for next generation console products including development for the PlayStation 2 console, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube. ... The increase is also due to research and development expenses related to the acquisition of DreamWorks Interactive, a software development company, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. We released a total of 55 new packaged goods products in fiscal 2001 compared to 69 new products in fiscal 2000. In addition, the EA.com website launched in October 2000, and had over 80 live games. Network Development and Support. The increase in network development and support expenses was primarily due to increased spending for the network infrastructure, and the Games Channel on the AOL service and the amortization of capitalized costs as required under Statement of Position 98 1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use", associated with the pre launch network infrastructure build. Customer Relationship Management. Customer relationship management increased due to increased headcount related costs associated with the formation of our customer relationship management organization for the live game site. Amortization of Intangibles % of net % of net 2001 revenues 2000 revenues % change $19,323,000 1.5% $11,989,000 0.8% 61.2% The amortization of intangibles resulted primarily from the acquisitions of Westwood, Kesmai, DreamWorks Interactive, ABC Software, Pogo and other acquisitions. Amortization of intangibles was $12,829,000 for EA Core and $6,494,000 for EA.com for fiscal 2001. Amortization of intangibles was $10,866,000 for EA Core and $1,123,000 for EA.com for fiscal 2000. Charge for Acquired In Process Technology % of net % of net 2001 revenues 2000 revenues % change $2,719,000 0.2% $6,539,000 0.5% (58.4%) Fiscal 2001: In connection with the acquisition of Pogo in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we allocated and expensed $2,719,000 of the $43,333,000 purchase price to acquired in process technology. At the date of acquisition, this amount was expensed as a non recurring charge as the in process technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses. Pogo had various projects in progress at the time of the acquisition. As of the acquisition date, costs to complete Pogo projects acquired were expected to be approximately $1,200,000 in future periods. During fiscal 2002, all of these development projects were completed and launched on Pogo gamesites. In conjunction with the acquisition of Pogo, we accrued approximately $100,000 related to direct transaction and other related costs. Fiscal 2000: ... In connection with the acquisition of Kesmai by EA.com in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we allocated and expensed $3,869,000 of the purchase price to acquired in process technology. ... In connection with the acquisitions of two development companies by EA Core, made in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2000, we allocated and expensed $2,670,000 of the purchase price to acquired in process technology. These charges were made after we concluded that the in process technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use after taking into consideration the potential for usage of the software in different products and resale of the software. 39 Interest and Other Income, Net % of net % of net 2001 revenues 2000 revenues % change $16,886,000 1.3% $16,028,000 1.1% 5.4% Interest and other income, net, increased in absolute dollars primarily due to higher interest income as a result of higher average cash balances and investing in higher yielding taxable securities in fiscal 2001. Those gains were partially offset by realized gains on sales of marketable securities in fiscal 2000. Income Taxes Effective Effective 2001 tax rate 2000 tax rate % change $(4,163,000) 31.0% $52,642,000 31.0% (107.9%) Our effective tax rate was 31.0% for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000. At March 31, 2001, we generated a federal income tax net operating loss. A substantial portion of this loss was utilized in a carryback claim with the remainder being carried forward. A valuation allowance was not established on this loss carryforward or other net deferred tax assets as we believed it was more likely than not that the results of future operations would generate sufficient taxable income to realize them. Net Income (loss) % of net % of net 2001 revenues 2000 revenues % change $(11,082,000) (0.8%) $116,751,000 8.2% (109.5%) In absolute dollars, reported net income (loss) decreased in fiscal 2001 primarily related to lower revenues as well as higher costs and expenses compared to fiscal 2000. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to the beginning of the transition period to next generation console systems. The increase in expenses was primarily due to increases in development of next generation console products in the Core business and the investment in EA.com, including expenses to build network and online game products and to launch our game sites in October 2000. Excluding goodwill, non cash compensation and one time charges in the amount of $17,077,000, net of taxes, for fiscal 2001, net income would have been $5,995,000. Excluding goodwill, non cash compensation and one time charges in the amount of $13,292,000, net of taxes, for fiscal 2000, net income would have been $130,043,000. 40 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES EA Core and EA.com As of March 31, 2002, our working capital was $699,561,000 compared to $478,701,000 at March 31, 2001. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments increased by $330,444,000 in fiscal 2002. We generated $284,971,000 of cash from operations, $98,840,000 of cash through the sale of equity securities under our stock plans, offset by $51,518,000 of cash used in capital expenditures during fiscal 2002. Reserves for bad debts and sales returns increased from $89,833,000 at March 31, 2001 to $115,870,000 at March 31, 2002. Reserves have been charged for returns of product and price protection credits issued for products sold in prior periods. Management believes these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and its current estimate of potential returns and allowances. Our principal source of liquidity is $796,936,000 in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and $6,869,000 in marketable securities. We expect that for the foreseeable future, our operating expenses will constitute a significant use of our cash balances. Management believes the existing cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and investment requirements on both a short term and long term basis. However, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those related to customer demand and acceptance of titles on new platforms and new title versions on existing platforms, our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due, successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives, the impact of competition, the economic conditions in the domestic and international markets, seasonality in operating results, risks of product returns and the other risks listed in the "Risk Factors" section. EA.com Included in the amounts above is the following for the EA.com business: . With the exception of the proceeds from the sale of stock and warrant to AOL in fiscal 2000 in the amount of $20,000,000, to date, EA.com has been funded solely by Electronic Arts. This funding has been accounted for as capital contributions from Electronic Arts. Excess cash generated from operations is transferred to Electronic Arts, and has been accounted for as a return of capital. We anticipate these funding procedures will continue in the near term. However, Electronic Arts may, at its discretion, provide funds to EA.com under a debt arrangement, instead of treating such funding as a capital contribution. . During fiscal 2002, EA.com used $99,696,000 of cash in operations (including payments to AOL of approximately $11,250,000), $13,112,000 in capital expenditures for computer equipment, network infrastructure, internal use software and related third party software, offset by $114,837,000 provided through the capital contributions from Electronic Arts. As a result of the net operating loss generated, we realized a tax benefit of approximately $47,011,000. . During fiscal 2001, EA.com used $132,210,000 of cash in operations (including payments to AOL of approximately $11,250,000), $68,887,000 in capital expenditures for computer equipment, network infrastructure, internal use software and related third party software, $43,333,000 for the acquisition of Pogo, excluding cash received of $762,000, offset by $245,141,000 provided through the capital contributions from Electronic Arts. As a result of the net operating loss generated, we realized a tax benefit of approximately $47,586,000. Under the AOL agreement entered into in November 1999, EA.com is required to pay $81,000,000 to AOL over the life of the five year agreement. Of this amount, $36,000,000 was paid upon signing the agreement with the remainder due in four equal annual installments beginning with the first anniversary of the initial payments. EA.com paid AOL $11,250,000 in both fiscal 2001 and 2002. Future liquidity needs of EA.com will be met by Electronic Arts as Electronic Arts intends to continue to fund the cash requirements of EA.com for the foreseeable future. 41 Other Commitments Advertising Commitments We made a commitment to spend $15,000,000 in offline media advertisements promoting our online games, including those on the AOL service, prior to March 31, 2005. As of March 31, 2002, we have spent approximately $3,500,000 against this commitment. On February 7, 2000, we acquired Kesmai from News America Corporation ("News Corp") in exchange for $22,500,000 in cash and approximately 206,000 shares of our existing common stock valued at $8,650,000. We agreed to spend $12,500,000 through the period ended June 1, 2002 in advertising with News Corp or any of its affiliates. In addition, if certain conditions are met, including that a qualified public offering of Class B common stock does not occur within twenty four months of News Corps purchase of such shares and all of the Class B outstanding shares have been converted to Class A common stock, then (1) News Corp has the right to (i) exchange Class B common stock for approximately 206,000 shares of Class A common stock, and (ii) receive cash from Electronic Arts in the amount of $9,650,000, and (2) we will agree to spend an additional $11,675,000 in advertising with News Corp and its affiliates. Lease Commitments We lease certain of our current facilities and certain equipment under non cancelable capital and operating lease agreements. We are required to pay property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs for certain of our facilities and will be required to pay any increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder of our facilities. In February of 1995, we entered into a build to suit lease with a financial institution on our headquarters facility in Redwood City, California, which was extended in July of 2001 and runs through July of 2006. We accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 ("SFAS 13"), "Accounting for Leases", as amended. Existing campus facilities developed in phase one comprise a total of 350,000 square feet and provide space for sales, marketing, administration and research and development functions. We have an option to purchase the property (land and facilities) for $145,000,000 or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for (1) an additional extension of the lease or (2) sale of the property to a third party with us retaining an obligation to the owner for the difference between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up to $128,900,000 if the sales price is less than this amount, subject to certain provisions of the lease. In December 2000, we entered into a second build to suit lease with a financial institution for a five year term from December 2000 to expand our headquarters facilities and develop adjacent property adding approximately 310,000 square feet to our campus. We expect to complete construction in June of 2002. We accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with SFAS 13, as amended. The facilities will provide space for marketing, sales and research and development. We have an option to purchase the property for $127,000,000 or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for (1) an extension of the lease or (2) sale of the property to a third party with us retaining an obligation to the owner for the difference between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up to $118,800,000 if the sales price is less than this amount, subject to certain provisions of the lease. Lease rates are based upon the Commercial Paper Rate. The two lease agreements described above require us to maintain certain financial covenants, all of which we were in compliance with as of March 31, 2002. Letters of Credit In connection with our purchases of N64 cartridges and Nintendo GameCube optical disks for distribution in North America, Nintendo requires us to provide irrevocable letters of credit prior to Nintendos acceptance of purchase orders from us for purchases of these cartridges and optical disks. For purchases of N64 cartridges and Nintendo GameCube optical disks for distribution in Japan and Europe, Nintendo requires us to make cash deposits. Development, Celebrity, League and Content Licenses: Payments and Commitments The products published by EA Studios are designed and created by our in house designers and artists and by independent software developers ("independent artists"). We typically pay the independent artists royalties based on the sales of the specific products, as defined in the related independent artist agreements. Advance payments on these royalties are paid to independent artists upon meeting deliverables as detailed in the contractual agreement. In addition, certain celebrity, league and content license contracts contain minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments that are not dependent on any deliverables. Celebrities and organizations with whom we have contracts include: FIFA, NASCAR, John Madden, National Basketball Association, PGA TOUR, Tiger Woods, National Hockey League, Formula One, Warner Bros. (Harry Potter), MGM/Danjaq (James Bond) and National Football League. These minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments are included in the table below. 42 Summary of minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of March 31, 2002 (in thousands): Commercial Contractual Obligations Commitments Bank and Fiscal Year Ended Minimum Other Letters of Ended March 31, Leases Advertising Guarantees AOL Marketing Guarantees Credit Total 2003 $18,288 $14,000 $35,663 $11,250 $19,541 $1,050 $1,122 $100,914 2004 15,011 3,500 22,812 11,250 16,554 171 69,298 2005 11,354 4,500 15,137 11,159 171 42,321 2006 10,810 16,483 4,572 171 32,036 2007 9,122 3,145 3,571 170 16,008 Thereafter 11,609 2,260 3,571 170 17,610 $76,194 $22,000 $95,500 $22,500 $58,968 $1,903 $1,122 $278,187 Transactions with Related Parties Square EA In May 1998, we completed the formation of a new joint venture with Square Co., Ltd. ("Square"), a leading developer and publisher of entertainment software in Japan. In North America, the companies formed Square Electronic Arts, LLC ("Square EA"), which has exclusive publishing rights in North America for future interactive entertainment titles created by Square. Additionally, we have the exclusive right to distribute in North America products published by this joint venture. Either party may terminate the existence of Square EA and the distribution agreement effective March 31, 2003. We own a 30% minority interest in this joint venture while Square owns 70%. This joint venture is accounted for under the equity method. In March 2002, we announced a publishing and distribution partnership with Square for Final Fantasy(R) X in Asia Pacific. The deal grants us the rights to distribute Final Fantasy X International for the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Korea. We generated $80,847,000 in net revenues from sales of Square EA products in fiscal 2002, $106,586,000 in net revenues from sales of Square EA products in fiscal 2001 and $83,657,000 in net revenues from sales of Square EA products in fiscal 2000. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", which supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 17 ("APB 17"), "Intangible Assets". SFAS 142 addresses the accounting treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets upon their acquisition, but not acquired in a business combination. This statement also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements. With the adoption of SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life; rather, goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. Also, if the benefit of an intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized. The terms of SFAS 142 are effective as of the beginning of the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2001. Certain provisions of SFAS 142 shall be applied to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets for which the acquisition date is after June 30, 2001. On April 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS 142. As a result of adopting this standard, we will continue to amortize finite lived intangibles, but will no longer amortize certain other intangible assets, most notably goodwill and acquired workforce, which had a net book value at March 31, 2002 of $69,050,000. Amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce totaled approximately $13,125,000 for fiscal 2002, approximately $9,182,000 for fiscal 2001 and approximately $6,411,000 for fiscal 2000. Based on intangible assets as of March 31, 2002, we estimate that amortization of finite lived intangibles will total approximately $8,700,000 for fiscal 2003. Following adoption of SFAS 142, we will continue to evaluate whether any event has occurred which might indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable. In addition, SFAS 142 requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. We are in the process of completing an evaluation for impairment of goodwill in accordance with SFAS 142. We believe the implementation of SFAS 142 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 43 In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 ("SFAS 143"), "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations". SFAS 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal use of the asset. SFAS 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 143 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets", which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of", and also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions", for the disposal of a segment of a business. SFAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are in the process of determining the impact of this new accounting standard. We believe the implementation of SFAS 144 will not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. 44 RISK FACTORS Electronic Arts business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance. Some of those important risks and uncertainties which may cause our operating results to vary or which may materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows: Risk Factors Relating to Our Core Business New Video Game Platforms Create Additional Technical and Business Model Uncertainties Large portions of our revenues are derived from the sale of products for play on proprietary video game platforms such as the Sony PlayStation. The success of our products is significantly affected by acceptance of the new video game hardware systems and the life span of older hardware platforms and our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful. Sometimes we will spend development and marketing resources on products designed for new video game systems that have not yet achieved large installed bases or will continue product development for older hardware platforms that may have shorter life cycles than we expected. Conversely, if we do not develop for a platform that achieves significant market acceptance, or discontinue development for a platform that has a longer life cycle than expected, our revenue growth may be adversely affected. For example, the Sega Dreamcast console launched in Japan in early 1999 and in the United States in September of 1999. We have developed no products for this platform. Had this platform achieved wide market acceptance, our revenue growth would have been adversely affected. Similarly, we are developing products for the Xbox and Nintendo GameCube. If these platforms do not achieve wide commercial acceptance, our revenue growth will be adversely impacted. Product Development Schedules Are Frequently Unreliable and Make Predicting Quarterly Results Difficult Product development schedules, particularly for new hardware platforms and high end multimedia personal computers, or PCs, are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes, use of new development tools for new platforms and the learning process, research and experimentation associated with development for new technologies. For example, EMPEROR: Battle for Dune for the PC, which was expected to ship in fiscal 2001 was not released until the first quarter of fiscal 2002 due to development delays. Also, James Bond 007 in...Agent Under Fire for the PS2, which was expected to ship in fiscal 2001, released in October of fiscal 2002 due to development delays. Additionally, development risks for CD ROM and DVD products can cause particular difficulties in predicting quarterly results because brief manufacturing lead times allow finalizing products and projected release dates late in a quarter. Our revenues and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules, and our failure to meet those schedules could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts expectations for any individual quarter and the fiscal year. Our Business Is Both Seasonal and Cyclical Our business is highly seasonal with a significant percentage of our revenues occurring in the December quarter. In fiscal 2002, these seasonal trends were magnified by general industry factors, including the platform transition, the fall 2001 launches of the Xbox and Nintendo GameCube in North America and the economic slowdown in the United States and other territories. Our business is also cyclical; video game platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years, and decline as more advanced platforms are being introduced. As one group of platforms is reaching the end of its cycle and new platforms are emerging, buying patterns may change. Purchases of products for older platforms may slow at a faster rate than sales of new platforms. We have been going through a platform transition during the last 18 months and are now well into a new platform cycle. Sony shipped its PlayStation 2 console in Japan in March 2000, in North America in October 2000 and in Europe in November 2000. Nintendo launched the Nintendo GameCube console in Japan in September 2001, North America in November 2001 and in Europe in May 2002. Microsoft launched the Xbox console in North America in November 2001, in Japan in February 2002 and in Europe in March 2002. Sales of our products for the N64 and Sony PlayStation platforms have already been adversely affected, and we expect this trend to continue. The Impact of e Commerce and Online Games on Our Business Is Not Known While we do not currently derive significant revenues from online sales of our packaged products, we believe that such form of distribution will become a more significant factor in our business in the future. E Commerce is becoming an increasingly popular method for conducting business with consumers. How that form of distribution will affect the more traditional retail distribution, at 45 which we have historically had success, and over what time period, is uncertain. In addition, we expect the number and popularity of online games to increase and become a significant factor in the interactive games business generally. We do not know how that increase generally, or the emerging business of EA.com specifically, will affect the sales of packaged goods. Our Business, Our Products, and Our Distribution Are Subject to Increasing Regulation of Content, Consumer Privacy and Online Delivery in Key Territories Legislation is increasingly introduced which may affect the content of our products and their distribution. For example, privacy rules in the United States and Europe impose various restrictions on our web sites. Those rules vary by territory while of course the Internet recognizes no geographical boundaries. Other countries such as Germany have adopted laws regulating content transmitted over the Internet that are stricter than current United States laws. In the United States, in response to recent events, the federal and several state governments are considering content restrictions on products such as those made by us as well as restrictions on distribution of such products. Any one or more of these factors could harm our business. Our Platform Licensors Are Our Chief Competitors and Frequently Control the Manufacturing of Our Video Game Products Our agreements with hardware licensors, which are also our chief competitors, typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products. This fact could, in certain circumstances, leave us unable to get our products approved, manufactured and shipped to customers. In most events, control of the approval and manufacturing process by the platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently. For example, in prior years, we experienced delays in obtaining approvals for and manufacturing of PlayStation products which caused delays in shipping those products. The potential for additional delay or refusal to approve or manufacture our products continues with our platform licensors. Such occurrences would harm our business and adversely affect our financial performance. Additionally, we have not negotiated a final publishing agreement with Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube platform and although we are currently operating under an understanding with Nintendo, we cannot be assured that the final terms of the formal agreement will be favorable. Proliferation and Assertion of Patents Poses Serious Risks to our Business Many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used game technologies. Additionally, many recently issued patents are now being asserted against Internet implementations of existing games. Several such patents have been asserted against us. Such claims can harm our business. We will incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims, regardless of the merits of the claims. In the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a third party patent, we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future. Risk Factors Relating to Our Online Business Because of EA.coms Limited Operating History, It Will Be Difficult To Evaluate its Business and Prospects EA.coms business is still in the developing stages, so evaluating its business and prospects will be more difficult than would be the case for a more mature business. We will continue to encounter the risks and difficulties faced in launching a new business, and we may not achieve our goals or may be compelled to change the manner in which we seek to develop the business. These uncertainties as to the future operations of EA.com will increase the difficulty we face in completing and pursuing the essential plans for the development of the business and will also make it more difficult for our stockholders and securities analysts to predict the operating results of this business. EA.com Has a History of Losses and Expects To Continue To Incur Losses and May Never Achieve Profitability EA.com has incurred substantial losses to date, including the current fiscal year. We expect EA.com to continue to incur losses as it builds its business. EA.com will be required to maintain the significant support, service and product enhancement demands of online users, and we cannot be certain that EA.com will produce sufficient revenues from its operations to support these costs. Even if profitability is achieved, EA.com may not be able to sustain it over a period of time. Our Agreements with America Online May Not Prove Successful to the Development of EA.coms Business We have a series of agreements with America Online ("AOL") for the offering of our games for online play. These agreements require that we make substantial guaranteed payments to AOL and that we commit our resources to the pursuit of the online game opportunity. We cannot be assured that the substantial costs associated with the AOL agreements will be justified by the revenues 46 generated from that relationship. In addition, restrictions included in the AOL agreements limiting other channels we may develop for offering online games may limit our ability to diversify our online distribution strategies. The success for us of the AOL agreements will also be a result of AOLs performance under the agreements, a factor over which we will have very little control. We Have Limited Experience with Online Games and May Not Be Able To Operate This Business Effectively Offering games solely for online play is a substantial departure from our traditional business of selling packaged software games. We have employed various revenue models, including subscription fees, "pay to play fees" and advertising. We have limited experience with developing optimal pricing strategies for online games. For example, our product Majestic and our Platinum offering, which contained certain browser based entertainment games, were launched with a monthly subscription pricing model and obtained only limited commercial success. Accordingly, we did not realize our projected cash flows and discontinued these offerings as part of EA.coms restructuring plan. Similarly, we have limited experience in predicting usage patterns for our games. Because of our inexperience in this area, we may not be effective in achieving success that may otherwise be attainable from offering our games online. Online Games Have Risks That Are Not Associated with Our Traditional Business Online games, particularly multiplayer games, pose risks to player enjoyment that do not generally apply to packaged goods games. Players frequently would not be acquainted with other players, which may adversely affect the playing experience. Social issues raised by a players conduct may impact the experience for other players. It is difficult to monitor player behavior that impairs the game experience. In addition, there are substantial technical challenges to be met both in the introduction of our games online and in maintaining an effective game playing environment over time. Also, hacking and spamming has become a serious problem for online sites, and significant hacking and spamming could seriously interfere with online game play. If these risks are not successfully controlled and technical challenges resolved, potential customers for our games may be unwilling to play in sufficient volume to allow us to attain or sustain profitability. Proliferation and Assertion of Patents Poses Serious Risks to the Business of EA.com Many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used Internet technologies. Additionally, many recently issued patents are now being asserted against Internet implementations of older technologies. Several such patents have been asserted against us. Such claims can harm our business. We will incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims, regardless of the merits of the claims. In the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a third party patent, we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future. Development of EA.coms Business Will Require Significant Capital, and We Cannot Be Assured That It Will Be Available EA.com will not be successful if it does not continue to receive substantial financing that is required to continue to build its business. Electronic Arts has agreed to provide a limited amount of funding to EA.com, but this financing alone may not be sufficient for the development of EA.coms business. Any additional funding that is obtained from Electronic Arts may either be treated as a debt arrangement or would increase Electronic Arts retained interest in EA.com and correspondingly decrease the interest of the holders of outstanding shares of Class B common stock. The attraction of additional equity or debt financing for EA.com from third parties may not be possible or may only be possible on terms that result in significant dilution to Class A and Class B common stockholders or incremental interest payments and debt related restrictions on the operation of the business. To date, nearly all funding (except warrants and cash from revenues) has been provided by Electronic Arts. If Use of the Internet Does Not Continue To Develop and Reliably Support the Demands Placed on It by Electronic Commerce, EA.coms Business Will Be Harmed EA.coms success depends upon growth in the use of the Internet as a medium for playing games. The use of the Internet for sophisticated games like ours is relatively new. Our business would be seriously harmed if: . use of the Internet does not continue to increase or increases more slowly than expected, . the infrastructure for the Internet does not effectively support online game play, . concerns over the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks inhibit the growth of the Internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions, or 47 . government regulations regarding Internet content, privacy or other conditions impede the effectiveness of the Internet to users. Capacity Restraints May Restrict the Use of the Internet as a Forum for Game Play, Resulting in Decreased Demand for Our Products The Internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by increased usage or the limited capacity of networks to transmit large amounts of data. Other risks associated with commercial use of the Internet could slow its growth, including: . outages and other delays resulting from the inadequate reliability of the network infrastructure, . slow development of enabling technologies and complementary products, and . limited availability and adoption by consumers of cost effective, high speed access. Delays in the development or adoption of new equipment standards or protocols required to handle increased levels of Internet activity, or increased governmental regulation, would cause the Internet to fail to gain, or lose, viability as a means of game playing. If these or any other factors cause use of the Internet for commerce to slow or decline, the Internet may not prove viable as a commercial marketplace. This, in turn, would result in decreased demand for EA.coms products and services. To Become and Remain Competitive, EA.com Must Continually Develop New Content. This Is Inherently Risky and Expensive. EA.coms success depends on our ability to develop new products and services for the EA.com site. Our agreement with AOL requires us to develop new games for the EA.com site. We cannot assure you that products will be developed on time, in a cost effective manner, or that they will be commercially successful. Currently, the release of several products such as The Sims Online and Earth & Beyond for which we expect to generate subscription revenue, have been delayed due to longer than anticipated development schedules. Similarly, the online product Majestic achieved only limited commercial success due in part to the length of time it took to download the online software component. Accordingly, we discontinued Majestic on May 1, 2002. We May Not Be Able To Respond to Rapid Technological Change The market for Internet products and services is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We will be required to continually improve performance, features, reliability and capacity of our network infrastructure. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in responding rapidly or in a cost effective manner to such developments. Increasing Governmental Regulation of the Internet Could Limit the Market for Our Products As Internet commerce continues to evolve, we expect that federal, state and foreign governments will adopt laws and regulations covering issues such as user privacy, taxation of goods and services provided over the Internet, pricing, content and quality of products and services. It is possible that legislation could expose companies involved in electronic commerce to liability, taxation or other increased costs, any of which could limit the growth of electronic commerce generally. Legislation could dampen the growth in Internet usage and decrease its acceptance as a communications and commercial medium. If enacted, these laws and regulations could limit the market for EA.coms products. Our Revenues Have Been Heavily Dependent on a Single Product and Would Be Adversely Affected if That Products Popularity Were To Decline In the near term, EA.coms subscription revenues to date have consisted primarily of revenues from sales of our online product Ultima Online, and we would be adversely affected if revenues from that product were to decline for any reason and not be replaced. We expect the online game market to become increasingly competitive, and it is possible that competing products could cause revenues from Ultima Online to decline. In addition, popularity of Ultima Online could decline over time simply because of consumer preference for new game experiences. 48 We Continue to Invest in Research and Development and Network Technology and Operations for EA.com, and We Cannot Be Assured That We Will Achieve Revenues That Support This Level of Spending We have invested heavily, and expect to continue to invest, in research and development and network technology and operations for our website and online games. While we have reduced the overall level of spending for EA.com, we will continue to invest in the technologies, tools and network infrastructure that are necessary for us to launch and support our key products, Earth & Beyond and The Sims Online. Accordingly, there are no assurances that the revenues from these products will exceed the associated costs in order for EA.com to achieve profitability. If we cannot increase revenues to profitable levels, the value of EA.com will be impaired. In order to develop the broad game offerings that we envision for our online operations it will continue to be necessary to engage in significant developmental efforts both to adapt existing Electronic Arts games to the online format and to create new online games. Our agreements with AOL require us to maintain a substantial commitment to online game development and we cannot be assured that we will realize acceptable returns from this investment. Online Product Development Schedules Are Unreliable and Make Predicting Quarterly Results Difficult Online product development schedules, particularly for Internet based games are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes, use of new development tools, Internet latency issues, a learning process to better understand Internet based game mechanics, and research and experimentation associated with development for new online technologies. Additionally, development risks for Internet based products can cause particular difficulties in predicting quarterly results because of the challenges associated with game testing, live Beta testing, integration into network servers and integration on to the Games web site and may impact the release ("go live") dates of products during a particular quarter. Several online products currently under development such as The Sims Online and Earth & Beyond have experienced development delays and will be released later than planned. Our revenues and operating costs are dependent on our ability to meet our product "go live" schedules, and our failure to meet those schedules could result in revenues falling short of analysts expectations, resulting in increased operating losses for EA.com. We Are Heavily Dependent on a Few Internet Infrastructure Service Providers to Host and Manage Our Servers at Co Location Facilities and Our Operating Results May Be Adversely Affected if We Must Change Service Providers We are dependent on a few third party internet infrastructure service providers to host and manage the majority of our servers that support our online games. The performance of these service providers are outside of our control. Many of the service providers in the internet infrastructure space require substantial financial resources to build, maintain and manage co location facilities. To the extent that industry, economic, financial or competitive factors influence the level of performance that we expect from service providers we currently use for co location space (bandwidth and rack), we may need to re locate our servers to another co location facility which would increase our expenses and may result in delays or reduced shipments of our online products, thereby adversely impact our operating results. GENERAL RISK FACTORS Because of the Competition for Qualified Technical, Creative, Marketing and Other Personnel, We May Not Be Able To Attract and Retain the Personnel Necessary for our Businesses The market for technical, creative, marketing and other personnel essential to the development of online businesses and management of our online and core businesses continues to be competitive, although current market conditions have made it less difficult to attract and retain the employees we need. In the last fiscal year, notwithstanding the downturn of the economy generally, competitive recruiting efforts aimed at Electronic Arts employees and executives continued. Electronic Arts leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent to assist in the consolidation that the interactive entertainment industry is experiencing. In addition, the cost of real estate in the San Francisco Bay area the location of our headquarters and largest studio remains relatively high, and has made recruiting from other areas and relocating employees to our headquarters more difficult. If we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need, our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired. Foreign Sales and Currency Fluctuations For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001, international net revenues comprised 37% of total consolidated net revenues. We expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and growing portion of our revenues. Such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers. Additionally, foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate. While we hedge against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot control translation issues. For example, our 49 Japan and Asia Pacific revenues in fiscal 2002 were adversely impacted by a devaluation of the Yen and Australian Dollar as compared to the prior year. The devaluation had an adverse effect for the year on our net revenues and net income. Any of these factors may significantly harm our business. Increased Difficulties in Forecasting Results During platform transition periods, where the success of our products is significantly impacted by the changing market for our products, forecasting our revenues and earnings is more difficult than in more stable or rising product markets. The demand for our products may decline during a transition faster than we anticipate, negatively impacting both revenues and earnings. At launch, Sony shipped only half of the number of PlayStation 2 units to retail in North America than it had originally planned, and it shipped significantly fewer units than planned at launch in Europe as well. Shortages were announced as being caused by shortages of components for manufacturing. Due to these shortages, our results of operations for fiscal 2001 were adversely affected. Consequently, if Microsoft or Nintendo do not ship the number of units planned for the Xbox and Nintendo GameCube, our sales of these products may be adversely affected in fiscal 2002. The Current Legislative and Regulatory Environment Affecting Generally Accepted Accounting Principles is Uncertain and Volatile, and Significant Changes in Current Principles Could Affect Our Financial Statements Going Forward. Recent actions and public comments from the SEC have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally. Similarly, Congress has considered a variety of bills that could affect certain accounting principles. In addition, the FASB and other regulatory accounting agencies have recently introduced several new or proposed accounting standards, some of which represent a significant change from current industry practices. While we do not anticipate that such proposals will affect the actual conduct of our business and we believe that our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we cannot predict the impact of the adoption of any such proposals on our financial statements going forward. Fluctuations in Stock Price Due to analysts expectations of continued growth and other factors, any shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period. As a result of the factors discussed in this report and other factors that may arise in the future, the market price of our common stock historically has been, and we expect will continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations over a short period of time. These fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us, to changes in analysts earnings estimates, or to factors affecting the computer, software, Internet, entertainment, media or electronics businesses. In addition, fluctuations may be due to uncertainties in the securities markets in general. For example, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, the price per share of our Class A common stock ranged from $26.59 to $56.13 and $42.40 to $66.01 during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002. World Events The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the Unites States, the subsequent US military action, and the continuing concerns over potential additional terrorist attacks against US interests and citizens pose serious uncertainties in our business. Consumer spending, consumer preferences in entertainment, and the securities markets generally may be affected on an ongoing and unpredictable basis by these events, all of which may make prediction of our results more difficult. Because of these and other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. 50 Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks, including the changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and prices. Foreign exchange contracts used to hedge foreign currency exposures and short term investments are subject to market risk. We do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We utilize foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures of underlying assets and liabilities, primarily certain intercompany receivables that are denominated in foreign currencies, thereby, limiting our risk. Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. At March 31, 2002, we had foreign exchange contracts, all with maturities of less than three months to purchase and sell approximately $226,330,000 in foreign currencies, primarily British Pounds, European Currency Units ("Euro"), Canadian Dollars and other currencies. Fair value represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate and the forward rate. The counterparties to these contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks. The risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material. Notwithstanding our efforts to manage foreign exchange risks, there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. The following table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts at March 31, 2002. The information is provided in U.S. dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount (forward amount), the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value. Weighted Average Contract Contract Amount Rate Fair Value (in thousands) (in thousands) Foreign currency to be sold under contract: British Pound $131,622 1.4229 $ (52) Euro 41,121 0.8749 179 Canadian Dollar 16,986 1.5895 67 Japanese Yen 6,431 132.64 (5) Swedish Krona 5,427 10.3189 43 Australian Dollar 4,206 0.5258 (58) South African Rand 3,125 12.4801 (281) Norwegian Krone 2,262 8.8409 13 Danish Krone 2,001 8.4965 10 Swiss Franc 1,199 1.6680 10 Total $214,380 $ (74) Foreign currency to be purchased under contract: British Pound $ 11,950 1.4253 $ (207) Total $ 11,950 $ (207) Grand total $226,330 $ (281) While the contract amounts provide one measurement of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts (arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be settled on a net basis at our option. We control credit risk through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities. We also manage our interest rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity. At March 31, 2002, our cash 51 equivalents, short term and long term investments included debt securities of $662,359,000. Notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks, there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. The table below presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates of our investment portfolio at March 31, 2002: Average Interest Rate Cost Fair Value (Dollars in thousands) Cash equivalents/(1)/ Fixed rate 3.75% $ 10,141 $ 10,141 Variable rate 2.06% $408,108 $408,108 Short term investments/(1)(2)/ Fixed rate 3.61% $235,769 $235,710 Variable rate 6.35% $ 8,400 $ 8,653 (1) See definition in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Maturity dates for short term investments range from 3 months to 31 months with call dates ranging from 3 months to 10 months. 52
