Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown. As a result, actual results may differ materially from our estimates. Sales allowances and bad debt reserves We principally derive revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on videogame consoles (such as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube), PCs and hand held game machines (such as the Nintendo Game Boy Advance). Product revenue is recognized net of sales allowances. We also have stock balancing programs for our personal computer products, which allow for the exchange of personal computer products by resellers under certain circumstances. We may decide to provide price protection for both our personal computer and video game system products. In making this determination we evaluate: inventory remaining in the channel, the rate of inventory sell through in the channel, and our remaining inventory on hand. It is our policy to exchange products or give credits, rather than give cash refunds. We estimate potential future product returns, price protection and stock balancing programs related to current period product revenue. We analyze historical returns, current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products, current trends in the video game market and the overall economy, changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and price protection allowances. In addition, management monitors and manages the volume of our sales to retailers and distributors and their inventories, as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel can result in high returns or the requirement for substantial price protection in subsequent periods. In the past, actual returns have not generally exceeded our reserves. However, actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. For example, the risk of product returns for our products may increase as the Xbox, Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 consoles pass the midpoint of their lifecycle and an increasing number and aggregate amount of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures. While management believes it can make reliable estimates for these matters, if we changed our assumptions and estimates, our returns reserves would change, which would impact the net revenue we report. For example, if actual returns were significantly greater than the reserves we have established, the actual results would decrease our reported revenue. Conversely, if actual returns were significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our reported revenue. Similarly, significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period. We determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends. Depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers, the amount and timing of our bad debt expense could change significantly. We cannot predict customer bankruptcies or an inability of any of our customers to meet their financial obligations to us. Therefore, our estimates could differ materially from actual results. Our gross accounts receivable balance was $246.7 million and our allowance for product returns, pricing allowances and doubtful accounts was $164.6 million as of March 31, 2003. As of March 31, 2002, our gross accounts receivable balance was $306.4 million and our allowance for product returns, pricing 24 Table of Contents allowances and doubtful accounts was $115.9 million. Reserves for bad debts and sales allowances increased 42 percent from $115.9 million at March 31, 2002 to $164.6 million at March 31, 2003. The increase in the overall reserves as of March 31, 2003 is due to the increase in gross revenue in the six and 12 months ended March 31, 2003 compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year. Net revenue increased 44 percent during fiscal 2003 due to the higher installed base of PlayStation 2 consoles and having a full year of sales of games for the Xbox and Nintendo GameCube. The increase in price protection and sales returns is directly attributable to the increase in sales that occurred during fiscal 2003. Sales return and price protection requirements as a percentage of gross revenue in the six and 12 months ended March 31, 2003 have remained relatively constant compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year. We have recorded reserves for returns of product and price protection credits issued for products sold in prior periods. We believe these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of potential returns and allowances. Prepaid royalties Prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments we make for manufacturing royalties, advances paid to our co publishing and or distribution affiliates and license fees paid to celebrities, professional sports organizations and other organizations for our use of their trade name and content. Also included in prepaid royalties are prepayments made to independent software developers under development arrangements that have alternative future uses. Prepaid royalties are expensed at the contractual or effective royalty rate as cost of goods sold based on actual net product sales. We evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties quarterly and charge to cost of goods sold any product post launch amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales. Any impairments on pre launch advances are charged to research and development expense. We rely on forecasted revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties. If actual revenue, or revised sales forecasts, fall below the initial forecasted sales, the charge may be larger than anticipated in any given quarter. Once the charge has been taken, that amount will not be expensed in future quarters when the product has shipped. The current portion of prepaid royalties, included in other current assets, was $39.9 million at March 31, 2003 and $65.5 million at March 31, 2002. The long term portion of prepaid royalties, included in other assets, was $7.4 million at March 31, 2003 and $1.2 million at March 31, 2002. Valuation of long lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets We evaluate both purchased intangible assets and long lived assets in order to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate an other than temporary impairment in value. This evaluation requires us to estimate, among other things, the remaining useful lives along with future estimates of cash flows of the business. All require the use of judgment and estimates. Our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates. Under current accounting standards, we make judgments about the remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet. In order to determine if an other than temporary impairment has occurred, management makes various assumptions about the future value of the asset, by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows. Our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play on proprietary video game platforms. The success of our products is affected by our ability to accurately predict which platforms and which products we develop will be successful. Also, our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules. Due to product sales shortfalls, we may not realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our long lived assets, which may result in an impairment charge recorded in the future. We recorded asset impairment charges of $66.3 million during fiscal 2003 and $12.8 million during fiscal 2002. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 hereof, for a discussion of the asset impairment charges recorded. On April 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result of adopting this standard, we will continue to amortize finite lived intangibles, but no longer amortize certain other intangible assets, most notably goodwill. In 25 Table of Contents lieu of amortization, SFAS No. 142 requires a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit. The first step, which was required to be completed by September 30, 2002, tests for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the Companys reporting unit level. The second step (if necessary), required to be completed by March 31, 2003, measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. We completed the first step of transitional goodwill impairment testing during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and found no indicators of impairment of our recorded goodwill. As a result, we have recognized no transitional impairment loss in fiscal 2003 in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142. We completed the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 with a measurement date of January 1, 2003 and found no indicators of impairment of our recorded goodwill. Future impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings and there is a potential for a write down of goodwill in connection with the annual impairment test. Following adoption of SFAS No. 142, we continue to evaluate whether any event has occurred which might indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable. Income taxes In the ordinary course of the Companys business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations and making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is established to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. To determine the quarterly tax rate, we are required to estimate full year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. The estimated effective tax rate is adjusted for the tax related to significant unusual items. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate. 26 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of Fiscal 2003 to 2002: Revenue We principally derive revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on videogame consoles (such as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube), PCs and hand held game machines (such as the Nintendo Game Boy Advance). We also derive additional revenue from selling subscriptions to some of our online games, selling advertisements on our online web pages, selling our packaged goods through our online store and by allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products. Geographically, our net revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 break down as follows (in thousands): 2003 2002 Increase % change North America $ 1,435,718 $ 1,093,244 $ 342,474 31% Europe 878,904 519,458 359,446 69% Asia Pacific 87,569 53,376 34,193 64% Japan 80,053 58,597 21,456 37% International 1,046,526 631,431 415,095 66% Consolidated Net Revenue $ 2,482,244 $ 1,724,675 $ 757,569 44% Net Revenue Net Revenue for fiscal 2003 increased by 44 percent as compared to fiscal 2002. The increase in net revenue was driven by the following: Increase in PlayStation 2 net revenue of $427.8 million driven by strong sales of key titles released in multiple territories including Medal of Honor Frontline, The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and The Sims. Higher installed base of game consoles, most notably the PlayStation 2. Net revenue from sales associated with the PlayStation 2 platform increased 89 percent to $910.7 million versus $482.9 million in the prior fiscal year. Higher installed base of the Xbox console, which is now available in every major market in which we operate. Fiscal 2003 contains 12 months of revenue from Xbox titles versus five months in fiscal 2002 due to the launch of this platform in November 2001. In fiscal 2003, we generated $219.4 million in net revenue from Xbox titles versus $78.4 million a year ago. Higher installed base of the Nintendo GameCube console, which is now available in every major market in which we operate. In fiscal 2002, Nintendo GameCube was only available in North America and Japan. In addition, fiscal 2003 contains 12 months of revenue from GameCube titles versus seven months in fiscal 2002 due to the launch of this platform in September 2001 in Japan and November 2001 in North America. In fiscal 2003, we generated $176.7 million in net revenue from Nintendo GameCube titles versus approximately $51.7 million a year ago. Net revenue from co publishing and distribution products increased by 40 percent to $375.8 million versus $269.0 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase was due in large part to sales of Kingdom Hearts, 1503 A.D. The New World and higher Battlefield 1942 franchise net revenue for an aggregate increase of $105.0 million in fiscal 2003. Net revenue from PC products increased by nine percent, mainly due to an increase in sales of The Sims franchise titles and new net revenue from SimCity 4, released in the fourth quarter of fiscal 27 Table of Contents 2003, for an aggregate increase of $71.0 million in net revenue. This increase was partially offset by lower net revenue on prior year releases Black and White and Dune Emperor totaling $32.2 million. Net revenue for the older generation PlayStation declined year over year as customers migrated to newer consoles. We expect lower overall industry pricing in fiscal 2004. North America For fiscal 2003, net revenue from sales in North America increased by 31 percent to $1.4 billion versus $1.1 billion in fiscal 2002. Growth in North American net revenue was driven by: Higher installed base of the PlayStation 2, resulting in an increase of $208.0 million in revenue from PlayStation 2 products, due in part to Sonys price cut of the hardware in North America in May 2002. This was reflected in strong sales of Medal of Honor Frontline, The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, The Sims, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 which generated a total of $201.2 million in net revenue in North America. Higher installed base of Xbox consoles resulting in an increase in revenue from Xbox titles of $89.2 million. The launch of the Xbox platform in North America occurred in November 2001. Consequently, fiscal 2002 contained only five months of Xbox revenue versus 12 months of revenue in fiscal 2003. Higher installed base of Nintendo GameCube consoles resulting in increased revenue from Nintendo GameCube titles of $64.7 million. Fiscal 2003 contains 12 months of revenue from Nintendo GameCube titles versus five months in fiscal 2002 due to the launch of this platform in November 2001. Additionally, in 2003 we released 17 games on the Nintendo GameCube platform compared to five releases in the prior year. Revenue from co publishing and distribution revenue increased by $37.3 million in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to sales of Kingdom Hearts, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger and higher current year net revenue for the Battlefield 1942 franchise titles, for an aggregate increase of $89.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in revenue on Final Fantasy franchise titles, $59.8 million. Net revenue from titles associated with PlayStation declined $49.4 million year over year as customers migrated to newer consoles. Our agreement to distribute Square products in North America will terminate on June 30, 2003 (see Joint Ventures and Investments, included in Item 1 hereof). We recorded $84.5 million in net revenue in fiscal 2003 and $80.8 million in net revenue in fiscal 2002 from sales of Square products in North America. International Europe For fiscal 2003, net revenue from sales in Europe increased by 69 percent to $878.9 million versus $519.5 million in fiscal 2002. Net revenue growth in Europe was driven by: Increase of $185.8 million from sales of titles for the PlayStation 2, most notably Medal of Honor Frontline, The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and The Sims for an aggregate of $145.3 million in net revenue, as well as a higher installed base of the PlayStation 2 hardware, due in part to Sonys hardware price cut in Europe in August 2002. Revenue from sales of titles designed for the Nintendo GameCube and Xbox platforms. We released 17 titles worldwide for the Nintendo GameCube, which launched in May 2002 in Europe, resulting in revenues of $57.7 million. Revenue from sales of Xbox products increased by $46.5 million with 19 Xbox titles available in Europe in fiscal 2003 versus three in 2002. The launch of Xbox in Europe occurred in March 2002. Consequently, our fiscal 2002 results contained only one month of revenue from sales of Xbox products versus 12 months in fiscal 2003. 28 Table of Contents Increase of $52.4 million in sales of PC titles primarily due to higher current year net revenue for The Sims franchise titles, and current year sales of SimCity 4 and 2002 FIFA World Cup for an aggregate increase of $47.9 million. Asia Pacific For fiscal 2003, net revenue from sales in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan, increased by 64 percent to $87.6 million versus $53.4 million in fiscal 2002. Growth in net revenue in Asia Pacific was driven by: Sales of PlayStation 2 titles increased by $15.7 million, due to strong sales of The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, Medal of Honor Frontline and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets totaling $10.9 million in net revenue. Sales of co publishing and distribution titles increased $11.1 million mainly due to sales of Final Fantasy X and Battlefield 1942 totaling $4.2 million in the current fiscal year. Additionally, revenue from sales of Xbox titles increased $6.3 million due to higher installed base and 20 Xbox titles available in the Asia Pacific region in 2003 versus three in 2002. Significant Xbox titles released in fiscal 2003 included Medal of Honor Frontline, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 and FIFA 2003 which generated a total of $3.2 million in net revenue. Japan For fiscal 2003, net revenue from sales in Japan increased by 37 percent to $80.1 million versus $58.6 million in fiscal 2002. Growth in net revenue in Japan was driven by: Higher PlayStation 2 installed base and strong sales of PlayStation 2 titles, most notably Medal of Honor Frontline, 2002 FIFA World Cup and Project FIFA World Cup, which generated a total of $15.7 million in net revenue in fiscal 2003. Increase in revenues from co publishing and distribution products of $11.0 million due in large part to sales of Final Fantasy 11. These increases were offset by the expected decrease in PlayStation revenue of $5.7 million. Revenue by Product Line Information about our worldwide net revenue by product line for fiscal 2003 and 2002 is presented below (in thousands): Increase/ 2003 2002 (Decrease) % change PlayStation 2 $ 910,693 $ 482,882 $427,811 89% PC 499,634 456,292 43,342 9% Xbox 219,378 78,363 141,015 180% Nintendo GameCube 176,656 51,740 124,916 241% PlayStation 99,951 189,535 (89,584 ) (47% ) Game Boy Advance 79,093 43,653 35,440 81% Online Subscriptions 37,851 30,940 6,911 22% Advertising 31,988 38,024 (6,036 ) (16% ) Game Boy Color 26,293 38,026 (11,733 ) (31% ) License, OEM and Other 24,948 46,210 (21,262 ) (46% ) 2,106,485 1,455,665 650,820 45% Co publishing and Distribution 375,759 269,010 106,749 40% Consolidated Net Revenue $ 2,482,244 $ 1,724,675 $757,569 44% 29 Table of Contents PlayStation 2 Net Revenue (in thousands) % of net % of net 2003 revenue 2002 revenue % change $910,693 37% $ 482,882 28% 89% Net revenue from PlayStation 2 titles increased in fiscal 2003 by 89 percent to $910.7 million versus $482.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the following: Strong consumer acceptance of the PlayStation 2 game console in every major market in which we operate. Higher installed base of the PlayStation 2 console due in part to Sonys hardware price cut in North America in May 2002 and in Europe in August 2002. Sales of Medal of Honor Frontline, The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and The Sims which generated a total of $343.7 million of net revenue in multiple territories. Strength of other PlayStation 2 franchise titles with higher net revenue on current year releases versus prior year releases including: James Bond 007, FIFA, Madden NFL, Tiger PGA Tour and NCAA Football for an aggregate increase of $96.0 million. We expect revenue from PlayStation 2 products to continue to grow in fiscal 2004, but not at the same rate as in fiscal 2003. Personal Computer Net Revenue (in thousands) % of net % of net 2003 revenue 2002 revenue % change $499,634 20% $ 456,292 26% 9% Net revenue from sales of titles for the PC increased in fiscal 2003 by nine percent to $499.6 million versus $456.3 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to strong sales of The Sims franchise titles, and the release of SimCity 4, for a combined increase of $71.0 million, partially offset by lower net revenue on prior year releases Black and White and Dune Emperor totaling $32.2 million. We expect revenue from PC products to be relatively flat in fiscal 2004. Xbox Net Revenue (in thousands) % of net % of net 2003 revenue 2002 revenue % change $219,378 9% $ 78,363 5% 180% Net revenue from sales of Xbox products increased in fiscal 2003 by 180 percent to $219.4 million versus $78.4 million in the prior fiscal period. The increase was primarily due to the following: The Xbox was launched in the United States in November 2001 and in Europe in March 2002. Therefore, in fiscal 2002, there was only a short period (five months in the United States and one month in Europe) during which we were able to release Xbox titles. We released fewer Xbox titles (10 in fiscal 2002 versus 16 in fiscal 2003) and the installed base of Xbox hardware was significantly smaller in fiscal 2002 than in fiscal 2003. Sales of Medal of Honor Frontline, NCAA Football 2003 and The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, which generated an aggregate of $41.2 million of net revenue in North America. Sales of FIFA 2003, James Bond 007: Nightfire, Medal of Honor Frontline and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which generated an aggregate of $27.4 million of net revenue in Europe. We expect net revenue from Xbox products to continue to grow in fiscal 2004, but for the rate of growth to decrease. 30 Table of Contents Nintendo GameCube Net Revenue (in thousands) % of net % of net 2003 revenue 2002 revenue % change $176,656 7% $ 51,740 3% 241% Net revenue from sales of Nintendo GameCube titles increased in fiscal 2003 by 241 percent to $176.7 million versus $51.7 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the following: Higher installed base of the Nintendo GameCube platform, which is now available in every major market in which we operate. The Nintendo GameCube was launched in North America in November 2001 and in Japan in September 2001. The Nintendo GameCube was not launched in Europe until May 2002. In total, we released 17 Nintendo GameCube titles during fiscal 2003 versus five Nintendo GameCube titles a year ago. Significant titles released in fiscal 2003 were Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Medal of Honor Frontline, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 and Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers which generated an aggregate of $68.7 million in net revenue. Significant titles in the prior year were Madden NFL 2002 and James Bond 007 in . . . Agent Under FireTM. We expect net revenue from Nintendo GameCube products to continue to grow in fiscal 2004, but for the rate of growth to decrease. PlayStation Net Revenue (in thousands) % of net % of net 2003 revenue 2002 revenue % change $99,951 4% $ 189,535 11% (47%) As we expected, the decrease in revenue from sales of PlayStation titles in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was attributable to the market transition to newer generation console systems. Although our PlayStation products are playable on the PlayStation 2 console, we expect sales of current PlayStation products to continue to decline in fiscal 2004. Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color Net Revenue (in thousands) % of net % of net 2003 revenue 2002 revenue % change Game Boy Advance $79,093 3% $ 43,653 3% 81% Game Boy Color $26,293 1% $ 38,026 2% (31%) Net revenue from sales of Game Boy Advance titles increased in fiscal 2003 by 81 percent to $79.1 million versus $43.7 million in the prior fiscal year primarily due to an increased number of Game Boy Advance titles available in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, seven titles were released on the Game Boy Advance platform compared to three in 2002. Also due to strong current year sales of The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers and higher net revenue on the fiscal 2003 release of the Harry Potter franchise title, generating an aggregate increase of $30.8 million. Net revenue from sales of Game Boy Color titles decreased 31 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the release of the hit title last year, Harry Potter and the Sorcerors Stone, as well as revenues from The World is Not Enough and Madden NFL 2002, versus only one new title released in the current year, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Additionally, the decrease in Game Boy Color net revenue for fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 compared to the prior year was attributable to the market transition to next generation console systems. We expect sales of current Game Boy Color products to continue to decline in fiscal 2004. 31 Table of Contents Online Subscription and Advertising Net Revenue (in thousands) % of net % of net 2003 revenue 2002 revenue % change Online Subscription $37,851 2% $ 30,940 2% 22% Advertising $31,988 1% $ 38,024 2% (16%) Net revenue from subscription fees for our online games increased 22 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the launch in fiscal 2003 of Earth & Beyond, and The Sims Online, and higher subscription revenue from Motor City Online, generating an aggregate increase of $8.6 million. These increases were partially offset by $1.1 million in Platinum and Sports subscription offerings, which we discontinued in November 2001. Revenue derived from advertising on our online games sites decreased 16 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to $3.8 million in lower advertising revenue generated from AOL and co branded AOL online properties, and a $1.8 million decrease in online advertising purchased by online game companies who link their games sites to ours. We expect advertising revenue to decline in fiscal 2004 as we have been advised by AOL to expect significant declines in future advertising related revenue. We expected The Sims Online to be our flagship online subscription offering. Through March 31, 2003, however, the number of units sold and number of subscribers for The Sims Online and Earth & Beyond have been below our expectations. As a result, we canceled most of our plans to develop similar online products and have consolidated the operations of our online games business into our core business. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 hereof. Co publishing and Distribution Net Revenue (in thousands) % of net % of net 2003 revenue 2002 revenue % change $375,759 15% $ 269,010 16% 40% Net revenue from co publishing products and distribution products increased 40 percent to $375.8 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $269.0 million in the prior fiscal year primarily due to strong sales of hit titles including Kingdom Hearts, 1503 A.D. The New World and higher Battlefield 1942 franchise net revenue, for an aggregate increase of $105.0 million in fiscal 2003. Operations by Segment In fiscal 2003 and 2002, we operated and reported our business in two business segments: EA Core business segment: creation, marketing and distribution of interactive entertainment software. EA.com business segment: creation, marketing and distribution of interactive entertainment software which can be played or sold online, ongoing management of subscriptions of online games and website advertising. The EA.com business segment represented our online and e Commerce businesses. The EA.com business segment included subscription revenue collected for Internet game play on our websites, website advertising, sales of packaged goods for Internet only games and sales of our packaged goods games sold through the our web store. The Consolidated Statements of Operations includes all revenue and costs directly and indirectly attributable to the EA.com business segment, including charges for shared facilities, functions and services. Certain costs and expenses are subjective and allocations were based on managements estimates. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 hereof. In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of the EA.com business segment into our core business. We now consider online functionality to be integral to our existing and future products. Accordingly, 32 Table of Contents beginning April 1, 2003, we no longer manage our online products and services as a separate business segment, and we will consolidate the reporting related to our online products and services into reporting for the overall development and publication of our core products for all reporting periods ending after that date. We believe that this will better reflect the way in which our Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews and manages our business and reflects the importance of our online products and services relative to the rest of our business. We believe we will only have one reportable segment in fiscal 2004 as a result of restructuring the EA.com business. Concurrently, we will also eliminate separate reporting for our Class B Common Stock for all reporting periods ending after April 1, 2003.

Cost of Goods Sold (in thousands) % of net % of net 2003 revenue 2002 revenue % change $1,072,802 43.2% $814,783 47.2% 31.7% Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue decreased by 4 percentage points to 43.2 percent in fiscal 2003 from 47.2 percent in fiscal 2002 primarily due to: Higher PC margins contributing a 1.7 percentage point increase to the total gross margins, due to higher sales of wholly owned intellectual properties such as SimCity 4 and Command & Conquer Generals, lower developer royalties in general and higher average sales prices. Higher margins on co publishing and distribution products contributing 0.9 percent to the total gross margins, due to higher volume of co publishing products, which have a higher gross margin than distribution products, released in fiscal 2003, such as Battlefield 1942, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger and The Simpsons Road Rage. Higher margins on PlayStation 2 products contributing 0.8 percent to the total gross margins due to volume discounts received from Sony and lower average manufacturing royalty rates. Marketing and Sales (in thousands) % of net % of net 2003 revenue 2002 revenue % change $332,453 13.4% $241,109 14.0% 37.9% Marketing and sales expenses increased by 37.9 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to: The release of 86 SKUs in fiscal 2003 versus 64 SKUs last year. The primary increase in marketing and sales expense in fiscal 2003 related to higher advertising spending of $46.1 million to support product releases on multiple platforms and across multiple territories including Madden NFL 2003, NBA Live 2003, The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, The Sims franchise titles and The Sims Online. Increase in headcount and related expenses of $20.5 million to support the growth of our marketing and sales functions worldwide. 35 Table of Contents As a percentage of net revenue, marketing and sales expenses declined from 14.0 percent of net revenue in fiscal 2002 to 13.4 percent of revenue in fiscal 2003. Marketing and sales includes vendor reimbursements for advertising expenses of $28.2 million in fiscal 2003 and $8.9 million in fiscal 2002 to support key titles. General and Administrative (in thousands) % of net % of net 2003 revenue 2002 revenue % change $130,859 5.3% $107,059 6.2% 22.2% General and administrative expenses increased by 22.2 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to an increase in payroll costs of $26.9 million to support the increased growth of these functions worldwide. As a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses declined from 6.2 percent of net revenue in fiscal 2002 to 5.3 percent of net revenue. Research and Development (in thousands) % of net % of net 2003 revenue 2002 revenue % change $400,990 16.1% $380,564 22.0% 5.4% Research and development expenses increased by 5.4 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to: Higher EA Core business segment expenses, which increased by $48.7 million, or 19 percent, due to additional headcount related expenses, offset by lower advance write offs of $27.2 million in fiscal 2003. Partially offset by lower EA.com business segment spending, which decreased by $28.3 million, or 22 percent, as a result of lower salary expense and development spending on discontinued products. The decrease in spending was partially offset by higher development spending associated with The Sims Online. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses declined from 22.0 percent of net revenue in fiscal 2002 to 16.1 percent of net revenue in fiscal 2003. Research and development includes vendor reimbursements for development expenses of $15.0 million in fiscal 2003 and $17.0 million in fiscal 2002 to support key titles. We expect research and development spending to increase in fiscal 2004 due to an increase in development spending for next generation console products including the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube, as well as extending our investment in the PC platform. Amortization of Intangibles (in thousands) % of net % of net 2003 revenue 2002 revenue % change $7,482 0.3% $25,418 1.5% (70.6%) Amortization of intangibles results primarily from our acquisitions of Westwood, Kesmai, DreamWorks Interactive, ABC Software, Pogo and other acquisitions. Amortization of intangibles was $3.5 million for the EA Core business segment and $4.0 million for the EA.com business segment for fiscal 2003. Amortization of intangibles was $12.9 million for the EA Core business segment and $12.5 million for the EA.com business segment for fiscal 2002. The decrease in amortization in fiscal 2003 of $17.9 million, was driven by: Adoption of SFAS No. 142 in fiscal 2003. For fiscal 2002, amortization of goodwill totaled $13.1 million. 36 Table of Contents Certain identifiable intangible assets related to Westwood and DreamWorks were amortized in fiscal 2002 resulting in a decrease of $3.5 million. Impairment of Pogo and Kesmai finite lived intangible assets as a result of the restructuring of the EA.com segment in fiscal 2003 and 2002 resulting in a decrease of $2.9 million. In addition, we recorded intangible impairment charges relating to our restructuring of the EA.com business segment of $12.4 million in fiscal 2003 and $1.6 million in fiscal 2002 (see our discussion under Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges below). Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges (in thousands) % of net % of net 2003 revenue 2002 revenue % change Restructuring Charges $15,102 0.6% $7,485 0.4% 101.8% Asset Impairment Charges $66,329 2.7% $12,818 0.8% 417.5% EA Core Business Segment During fiscal 2003, we closed our office located in San Francisco, California and our studio located in Seattle, Washington. The office and studio closures were a result of our strategic decision to consolidate local development efforts in Redwood City, California and Vancouver, Canada. We recorded total pre tax restructuring charges of $7.9 million and asset impairment charges of $1.5 million. This charge consists of $7.3 million for consolidation of facilities, $1.5 million for the write off of non current assets and $0.6 million for workforce reductions. The facilities charge was net of a reduction in deferred rent of $0.5 million. The exit plans resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 33 personnel in development and administrative departments. The estimated costs for consolidation of facilities included contractual rental commitments under the real estate lease for vacated office space, offset by estimated future sub lease income. In addition, the exit plans resulted in the write off of certain non current fixed assets, primarily leasehold improvements. Additionally, during fiscal 2003, we consolidated our Los Angeles, Irvine and Las Vegas studios into one major game development studio in Los Angeles. These measures were taken in order to maximize efficiencies and streamline the creative development process and operations of our studios. In connection with these consolidation activities, we recorded a total pre tax restructuring charge of $3.1 million and asset impairment charges of $2.0 million. This charge includes $1.6 million for the shutdown of facilities related to non cancelable lease payments for permanently vacated properties and associated costs, $2.0 million for the write off of abandoned equipment and leasehold improvements at facilities that were permanently vacated and $1.5 million for employee severance expenses related to involuntary terminations. EA.com Business Segment Fiscal 2003 Restructuring During fiscal 2003, we consolidated the operations of the EA.com business segment into our core business, and have eliminated separate reporting for our Class B common stock for all future reporting periods after fiscal 2003. As a result of this restructuring, we recorded a pre tax charge of $67.0 million in fiscal 2003, consisting of $1.8 million for workforce reductions, $2.3 million for consolidation of facilities and other administrative charges, and $62.9 million for the write off of non current assets. We will make adjustments to the restructuring reserves in future periods, if necessary, based upon the then current events and circumstances. The restructuring plan resulted in the termination of approximately 50 employees, mostly in research and development. The estimated costs for consolidation of facilities and other administrative charges included contractual rental commitments under real estate leases for unutilized office space offset by estimated future sub lease income and costs to close the facilities. 37 Table of Contents We performed an evaluation of asset impairment under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, to adjust the depreciable assets and remaining finite lived identifiable intangibles utilized in the EA.com business segment to their estimated fair value. This test was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and the measurement date was January 1, 2003. In February 2003, our only outside holder of Class B common stock, AOL, exercised its right to exchange its Class B shares for shares of Class A common stock. In late December 2002, we launched The Sims Online, an online game based on our very popular The Sims line of PC games, which have sold over 20 million units worldwide. The Sims Online was expected to be our flagship online subscription offering. Through March 31, 2003, the number of units sold and number of subscribers for The Sims Online, along with other EA.com business segment revenue, were significantly below our expectations. As a result of these triggering events in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we canceled most of our plans to develop similar online products and substantially reduced our expected future undiscounted cash flows related to these long lived assets. We recorded impairment charges on long lived assets of $62.9 million, including $24.9 million relating to impaired customized internal use software systems for our online games and website infrastructure, $25.6 million for other long lived assets and $12.4 million of finite lived intangibles impairment charges relating to our Kesmai and Pogo online game studios. There are no assurances that the impairment factors evaluated by management will not change in subsequent periods and accordingly, we may record additional impairment charges in future periods. In conjunction with our annual policy to reassess the remaining useful lives of goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles and to test the recoverability of these long lived assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as of January 1, 2003, we also performed fair value based tests to evaluate impairment of assets included in the EA.com reporting unit. Under this test, the fair value based tests did not indicate an impairment of our recorded goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles at the EA.com reporting unit level. However, future impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings and a corresponding write down of goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles. The following table reflects our unaudited pro forma consolidated basic earnings (loss) per share for the years ended 2003, 2002 and 2001 as if the consolidation of the operations of our EA.com business segment into our core business had occurred at the beginning of each of the periods presented (in thousands, except per share data): Consolidated 2003 2002 2001 Net income (loss): As reported $317,097 $101,509 $ (11,082 ) Pro forma $317,097 $101,509 $ (11,082 ) Earnings (loss) per share: As reported basic $2.34 $0.91 $ 0.09 Pro forma basic $2.24 $0.74 $ (0.08 ) Number of shares used in computation: As reported 140,989 136,832 131,404 Add: conversion of AOL and News Corp Class B 514 684 684 Pro forma 141,503 137,516 132,088 Fiscal 2002 Restructuring During fiscal 2002, we announced a restructuring plan for our EA.com business segment to reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities. These restructuring and resulting asset impairment charges were necessary in order to focus on key online priorities and reduce the EA.com business segments operating cost structure. As a result of this restructuring, we recorded a pre tax charge of $20.3 million in fiscal 2002, consisting of $4.2 million for workforce reductions, $3.3 million for consolidation of facilities and other administrative charges and $12.8 million for the write off of non current assets. We will make 38 Table of Contents adjustments to the restructuring reserves in future periods, if necessary, based upon the then current events and circumstances. The restructuring plan resulted in the termination of approximately 270 employees, or one third of the EA.com business segment workforce, which affected all departments across the organization. The estimated costs for consolidation of facilities are comprised of contractual rental commitments under real estate leases for vacated office space offset by estimated future sub lease income. Included in these costs are estimated costs to close offices or consolidate facilities in various locations and costs to write off a portion of the assets from these facilities. In addition, our restructuring efforts required an evaluation of asset impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, to adjust these depreciable assets and certain intangibles to their estimated fair value. We evaluated the impact of consolidating or abandoning certain online technologies and processes and reviewed the effect of changes to our subscription online product offerings in relation to the asset base of the EA.com business segment. As a result, it was determined that certain long lived assets would be abandoned or were related to products or services that had been discontinued and would therefore be written down to their estimated net disposal value. Impairment charges on long lived assets amounted to $12.8 million, including $11.2 million relating to abandoned technologies consisting of customized internal use software systems for our online infrastructure, $1.0 million of intangibles impairment charges related to our Kesmai online development studio resulting from discontinuing associated products and services and $0.6 million of goodwill charges relating to our San Diego online game studio closure. We may change these impairment factors in subsequent periods and accordingly, we could record additional impairment charges in future periods. Interest and Other Income, Net (in thousands) % of net % of net 2003 revenue 2002 revenue % change $5,222 0.2% $12,848 0.7% (59.4%) Interest and other income, net, in fiscal 2003 decreased from fiscal 2002 primarily due to: Other than temporary impairment of investments in affiliates of $10.6 million in fiscal 2003. Partially offset by higher interest income in fiscal 2003 of $5.1 million, as a result of higher average cash balances in the current year. Income Taxes (in thousands) Effective Effective 2003 tax rate 2002 tax rate % change $143,049 31.0% $45,969 31.0% 211.2% Our effective tax rate was 31.0 percent for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. Net Income (in thousands) % of net % of net 2003 revenue 2002 revenue % change $317,097 12.8% $101,509 5.9% 212.4% Reported net income increased in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 primarily related to: Higher revenues and gross profits. Partially offset by an increase in expenses compared to fiscal 2002. The increase in expenses was primarily due to increases in marketing and advertising costs to support a higher number of key releases in multiple territories and spending on our products for the Xbox and Nintendo GameCube consoles which, in fiscal 2003, have been available in all of our significant geographical markets. In 39 Table of Contents addition, there was an increase in expenses due to higher charges for restructuring and asset impairment in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. Although the dollar amount of expenses rose in fiscal 2003 versus fiscal 2002, net income as a percentage of sales increased to 12.8 percent versus 5.9 percent as expenses grew at a slower rate than did our revenues. Comparison of Fiscal 2002 to 2001: Revenue Geographically, our net revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001 break down as follows: (in thousands): 2002 2001 Increase % change North America $ 1,093,244 $ 831,924 $ 261,320 31% Europe 519,458 386,728 132,730 34% Asia Pacific 53,376 51,039 2,337 5% Japan 58,597 52,582 6,015 11% International 631,431 490,349 141,082 29% Consolidated Net Revenue $ 1,724,675 $ 1,322,273 $ 402,402 30% North America Net Revenue The increase in North America net revenue for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily attributable to: A 111 percent increase in PlayStation 2 revenue for the year due to the shipment of key titles such as Madden NFL 2002, James Bond 007 in . . . Agent Under Fire, NBA Street, NBA Live 2002 and SSX Tricky, a higher installed base of hardware and a strong catalogue business. PlayStation 2 launched in October 2000. Consequently, fiscal 2001 includes six months of PlayStation 2 product revenue as compared to 12 months of revenue for PlayStation 2 titles in fiscal 2002. The launch of the Xbox platform in North America in November 2001, which generated $73.6 million in revenue from Xbox titles such as Madden NFL 2002, NBA Live 2002, James Bond 007 in . . . Agent Under Fire, NASCAR Thunder 2002, NHL 2002 and SSX Tricky. The launch of Nintendo GameCube in North America in November 2001, which generated $48.7 million for the year from key GameCube titles such as Madden NFL 2002, James Bond 007 in . . . Agent Under Fire, SSX Tricky, NBA Street and FIFA Soccer 2002. Revenue was generated for the first time in fiscal 2002 by Game Boy Advance titles, amounting to $26.0 million for the year from key titles including Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, Madden NFL and NHL 2002. Also, revenue was generated for the first time in fiscal 2002 by Game Boy Color titles, amounting to $16.9 million for the year from titles such as Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, Madden NFL 2002 and The World Is Not Enough. Advertising revenue increased by $31.8 million for fiscal 2002, because we had 12 months of advertising revenue in fiscal 2002 compared to only six months of advertising revenue in fiscal 2001. This was because we commenced generating advertising revenue immediately following the launch of our online games website in October 2000. In addition, subsequent to our February 2001 acquisition of Pogo Corporation, advertising revenue generated from Pogo websites was included in our revenues. These increases were partially offset by the continued expected decreases in revenue for PlayStation and Nintendo 64 titles due to the declining markets for those platforms and fewer titles shipped in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. 40 Table of Contents International Net Revenue The increase in international net revenue for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was attributable to the following: Net revenue from operations in Europe increased by 34 percent compared to fiscal 2001 primarily due to higher sales of PlayStation 2, PC, co publishing and distribution products, partially offset by the expected decrease of revenue from Sony PlayStation products. PlayStation 2 launched in November 2000. Consequently, fiscal 2001 includes five months of revenue from PlayStation 2 titles as compared to 12 months of revenue from PlayStation 2 titles in fiscal 2002, resulting in an 80 percent increase in revenues from PlayStation 2 titles. Net revenue in our Asia Pacific territory, excluding Japan, increased by five percent compared to fiscal 2001 primarily due to higher sales of PlayStation 2, Game Boy Color and PC titles, partially offset by the expected decrease in PlayStation and Nintendo 64 title sales, and an unfavorable exchange rate comparison of approximately 10 percent. Revenue from PlayStation 2 titles increased by 46 percent, partially offset by a 34 percent decrease in revenue from PlayStation titles in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Net revenue from operations in Japan increased by 11 percent compared to fiscal 2001 primarily due to higher revenue from our co publishing and distribution titles, and revenue generated from sales of PlayStation, Nintendo GameCube and Xbox products, offset by the strong sales of our first PlayStation 2 title, FIFA Soccer World Championship, in the prior year and weakness in the Yen currency during fiscal 2002 resulting in a rate decrease of approximately 14 percent from fiscal 2001. Also, our operations in Japan did not benefit from our primary PlayStation 2 releases during fiscal 2002, which had more appeal to the North American market. Revenue from PlayStation 2 titles decreased by 50 percent in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001.

Key fiscal 2002 product releases were Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, The Sims Hot Date Expansion Pack, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, Command & Conquer Renegade and Madden NFL 2002. We released 16 PC titles in the fiscal 2002 compared to 18 in the prior fiscal year. PlayStation Net Revenue (in thousands) % of net % of net 2002 revenue 2001 revenue % change $189,535 11% $ 309,988 23% (39%) We released five PlayStation titles in fiscal 2002 compared to 17 titles in the prior fiscal year. As expected, PlayStation sales decreased in fiscal 2002 compared to the prior year primarily due to the transition to 128 bit console systems (such as the PlayStation 2) and fewer titles released for the PlayStation during fiscal 2002. Xbox Net Revenue (in thousands) % of net % of net 2002 revenue 2001 revenue % change $ 78,363 5% $ 0% NA Following the launch of the Xbox console in North America in November 2001, we released our first ten Xbox titles during fiscal 2002.

Online Subscription and Advertising Net Revenue (in thousands) % of net % of net 2002 revenue 2001 revenue % change Online Subscription $ 30,940 2% $ 28,878 2% 7% Advertising $ 38,024 2% $ 6,175 1% 516% The increase in online subscription revenue in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to the continued strong sales of Ultima Online Third Dawn, the release of Ultima Online Lord Blackthorns Revenge in February 2002 and the launch of Motor City Online in October 2001, which contributed $1.5 million in subscription revenue for fiscal 2002. This increase was offset by a decrease in subscription revenue of $5.0 million for Gamestorm, Kesmai Corporation (Kesmai) and Worldplay online games (most of which were transferred to our free service when the EA/ AOL site went live in October 2000) in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. We began generating advertising revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 following the launch of our online games site on the world wide web and on the AOL Games Channel in October 2000. In addition, we generated advertising revenue from games websites operated by Pogo Corporation after our purchase of Pogo Corporation in February 2001. Because we launched our ad business in late fiscal 2001, we experienced significant revenue growth in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. Co publishing and Distribution Product Net Revenue (in thousands) % of net % of net 2002 revenue 2001 revenue % change $ 269,010 16% $ 222,278 17% 21% Co publishing and distribution product sales increased for fiscal 2002 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to strong sales in fiscal 2002 of hit titles including Devil May Cry, Resident Evil: Code Veronica and The Simpsons Road Rage. This was partially offset by lower revenue from shipment of Square EA products due to fewer titles released in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Operations by Segment In fiscal 2002 and 2001, we operated and reported our business in two business segments: EA Core business segment: creation, marketing and distribution of interactive entertainment software. EA.com business segment: creation, marketing and distribution of interactive entertainment software which can be played or sold online, ongoing management of subscriptions of online games and website advertising. The Consolidated Statements of Operations break out all revenue and costs directly and indirectly attributable to the EA.com business segment, including charges for shared facilities, functions and services. Certain costs and expenses were determined on a subjective basis and allocations were based on our estimates. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 hereof 43 Table of Contents regarding changes to the EA.com business segment. Information about our operations by segment for fiscal 2002 and 2001 is presented below (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2002 EA Core Electronic (excl.

Carriage Fee is the amount paid to AOL for the right to distribute our online games site on their online services and thereby reach AOLs subscribers and users. (b) EA.com Research and Development includes $59.5 million of Network Development and Support for fiscal 2002 and $51.8 million in fiscal 2001; and includes $10.6 million of Customer Relationship Management for fiscal 2002 and $11.4 million in fiscal 2001. Costs and Expenses, Interest and Other Income, Net, Income Taxes and Net Income (Loss) for both EA Core and EA.com Segments Cost of Goods Sold (in thousands) % of net % of net 2002 revenue 2001 revenue % change $ 814,783 47.2% $ 664,991 50.3% 22.5% Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 due to: Revenue from Xbox and Nintendo GameCube titles with lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue. Higher revenue from PlayStation 2 titles in fiscal 2002. Higher advertising revenue, which has low cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue. 45 Table of Contents Lower revenue on Nintendo 64 products with high cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue. Higher margins in our co publishing and distribution business due to a higher number of co publishing titles with lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue. Higher average margins on our PC products. These items were partially offset by: Higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue on our PlayStation and PlayStation 2 products as compared to fiscal 2001. Revenue from Nintendo Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color titles with higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue. Lower revenues from high margin PC titles in fiscal 2002. Marketing and Sales (in thousands) % of net % of net 2002 revenue 2001 revenue % change $ 241,109 14.0% $ 185,336 14.0% 30.1% As a percent of revenue, marketing and sales expense in fiscal 2002 was 14 percent, that same percentage as fiscal 2001. Marketing and sales expenses for fiscal 2002 increased 30.1 percent, primarily attributed to: Higher marketing and advertising in North America and Europe for programs to support Madden NFL 2002, James Bond 007 in Agent Under Fire, SSX Tricky, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, FIFA Soccer 2002 and NBA Live 2002. Higher marketing and sales expenses for our online business due to increased consumer promotions and advertising media placement costs to promote new game offerings, particularly Majestic and Motor City Online, and higher expenditures associated with selling advertising on both the EA.com and Pogo games websites. The amortization of the AOL Carriage Fee, which began with the launch of the online games site in October 2000. These items were partially offset by vendor reimbursements for advertising expenses of $8.9 million in fiscal 2002 to support key titles. There were no vendor reimbursements received in fiscal 2001. General and Administrative (in thousands) % of net % of net 2002 revenue 2001 revenue % change $ 107,059 6.2% $ 104,041 7.9% 2.9% General and administrative expenses increased 2.9 percent in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001, primarily attributed to: $1.0 million contribution to charity organizations providing support for the September 11th tragedy. Increase in payroll and occupancy costs to support the increased growth in North America. Increase in bad debt expense of $1.8 million due to higher product sales. Research and Development (in thousands) % of net % of net 2002 revenue 2001 revenue % change $ 380,564 22.0% $ 376,179 28.4% 1.2% 46 Table of Contents Research and development expenses increased slightly in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001, primarily attributable to: Increased payroll costs due to higher headcount in EA Studios, net of co development arrangements. Increased spending on online projects in development, primarily The Sims Online and Earth & Beyond. Increased depreciation related to both hardware and internally developed software that began when our online games site went live in October 2000. Increased headcount and network related costs associated with our Pogo development studio and online games site. These increases were offset by: Headcount reductions in our online business in October 2001 (see Charge for Restructuring and Impairment discussion below). Replacement of the free online games channel, that had been on our online games site, with Pogo free games acquired as part of our acquisition of Pogo Corporation in February 2001. Vendor reimbursements for development expenses of $17.0 million in fiscal 2002 to support key titles. There were no vendor reimbursements received in fiscal 2001. Amortization of Intangibles (in thousands) % of net % of net 2002 revenue 2001 revenue % change $25,418 1.5% $ 19,323 1.5% 31.5% Amortization of intangibles results primarily from amortizing purchased goodwill and intangibles associated with acquisitions, including Westwood, Kesmai, DreamWorks Interactive, ABC Software and Pogo Corporation. Amortization of purchased goodwill and intangibles was $12.9 million for the EA Core business segment and $12.5 million for the EA.com business segment for fiscal 2002. Amortization of intangibles was $12.8 million for the EA Core business segment and $6.5 million for the EA.com business segment for fiscal 2001. The increase in amortization of intangibles in fiscal 2002 for the EA.com business segment, compared to the prior year, was due to our acquisition of Pogo Corporation in February 2001. In addition, we recorded intangible impairment charges of $1.6 million in fiscal 2002 relating to our restructuring of our online business. Charge for Acquired In Process Technology (in thousands) % of net % of net 2002 revenue 2001 revenue % change $ N/A $ 2,719 0.2% N/M In connection with the acquisition of Pogo Corporation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we allocated and expensed $2.7 million of the $43.3 million purchase price to acquired in process technology. At the date of the closing of the acquisition, this amount was expensed as a non recurring charge as the in process technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses. Pogo had various projects in progress at the time of the acquisition. As of the acquisition date, costs to complete Pogo projects acquired were expected to be approximately $1.2 million in future periods. During fiscal 2002, all of these development projects were completed and launched on our Pogo online games sites. In conjunction with the acquisition of Pogo, we accrued approximately $0.1 million related to direct transaction and other related costs. We recorded this charge after concluding that the in process technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use after taking into consideration the potential for usage of the software in different products and resale of the software. 47 Table of Contents Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges (in thousands) % of net % of net 2002 revenue 2001 revenue % change $ 20,303 1.2% $ N/A N/M During fiscal 2002, we announced a restructuring plan for the EA.com business segment to reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities. The restructuring and resulting asset impairment charges were necessary in order to focus on key online priorities and reduce the EA.com segments operating cost structure. A pre tax charge of $20.3 million was recorded in fiscal 2002, consisting of $4.2 million for workforce reductions, $3.3 million for consolidation of facilities and other administrative charges and $12.8 million for the write off of non current assets as a direct result of the restructuring. We will make adjustments to the restructuring reserves in future periods, if necessary, based upon events and circumstances that we encounter in the future. The restructuring plan resulted in the termination of approximately 270 employees, or one third of the workforce of the EA.com business segment, which affected all departments across the organization. The estimated costs for consolidation of facilities are comprised of contractual rental commitments under real estate leases for unutilized office space offset by estimated future sub lease income. Included in these costs are estimated costs to close offices or consolidate facilities in various locations and costs to write off a portion of the assets from these facilities. In addition, the restructuring efforts required an evaluation of asset impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, to adjust these depreciable assets and certain intangibles to their estimated fair value. Management evaluated the impact of consolidating or abandoning certain online technologies and processes and reviewed the effect of changes to our subscription online product offerings in relation to the EA.com segments asset base. As a result, it was determined that certain long lived assets would be abandoned or were related to products or services that had been discontinued and would therefore be written down to their estimated net disposal value. We recorded impairment charges on long lived assets of $12.8 million, including $11.2 million relating to consolidated or abandoned technologies for our online game site infrastructure and $1.6 million of goodwill and intangibles impairment charges relating to our San Diego and Kesmai online games development studios. These impairment factors may change in subsequent periods and accordingly, we may record additional impairment charges in future periods. Interest and Other Income, Net (in thousands) % of net % of net 2002 revenue 2001 revenue % change $ 12,848 0.7% $ 16,886 1.3% (23.9%) Interest and other income, net, decreased by 23.9 percent primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2002 and an increase in the cost of utilizing foreign exchange hedge contracts. Income Taxes (in thousands) Effective Effective 2002 tax rate 2001 tax rate % change $ 45,969 31.0% $ (4,163) 31.0% N/M Our effective tax rate was 31.0 percent for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001. At March 31, 2002, we generated a federal income tax net operating loss. This loss will be carried forward to future tax years. At March 31, 2001, we also generated a federal income tax net operating loss. We used a substantial portion of this loss in a carryback claim with the remainder being carried forward. The net operating losses for both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 resulted from losses from our EA.com business segment operations as well as stock 48 Table of Contents option deductions. We did not establish a valuation allowance on these loss carryforwards or other net deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize them. Net Income (loss) (in thousands) % of net % of net 2002 revenue 2001 revenue % change $ 101,509 5.9% $ (11,082) (0.8%) N/M Reported net income (loss) increased in fiscal 2002 primarily due to higher net revenue, partially offset by higher expenses compared to fiscal 2001. The increase in expenses was primarily due to increases in marketing and advertising costs to support a higher number of franchise titles. Expenses were also higher in fiscal 2002 due to restructuring and asset impairment charges discussed above. 49 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of March 31, 2003, our working capital was $1.34 billion compared to $699.6 million at March 31, 2002. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments increased by $790.7 million in fiscal 2003. We generated $714.5 million of cash from operations, $131.7 million of cash through the sale of equity securities under our stock plans, and used $59.1 million of cash in capital expenditures during fiscal 2003. Our principal source of liquidity is $1.59 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and $1.1 million in marketable securities at March 31, 2003. We believe the existing cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and investment requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those related to customer demand and acceptance of titles on new platforms and new title versions on existing platforms, our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due, successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives, the impact of competition, the economic conditions in the domestic and international markets, seasonality in operating results, risks of product returns and the other risks listed in the Risk Factors section. EA.com Business Segment Included in the amounts above is the following for the EA.com business segment: The EA.com business segment has been funded solely by Electronic Arts, with the exception of $20.0 million in proceeds from the sale of equities to AOL in fiscal 2000. This funding has been accounted for as capital contributions from Electronic Arts. Excess cash generated from EA.com business segment operations has been transferred to Electronic Arts, and has been accounted for as a return of capital. In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of EA.com into our core business. As such, our online products and services will no longer have separate funding needs in the foreseeable future. We do not expect this consolidation to have a material impact on our future liquidity and capital resource needs. The majority of outstanding Class B options, shares and warrants were retired or exchanged for Class A shares and warrants during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2003, the EA.com business segment used $35.9 million of cash in operations, $0.8 million in capital expenditures for computer equipment, offset by $35.1 million in capital contributions received from Electronic Arts. As a result of the $157.5 million net operating loss generated in the EA.com business segment, we realized a tax benefit of approximately $48.8 million. During fiscal 2002, the EA.com business segment used $99.7 million of cash in operations, $13.1 million in capital expenditures for computer equipment, internal use software and third party technology licenses, offset by $114.8 million in capital contributions received from Electronic Arts. As a result of the $151.6 million net operating loss generated in the EA.com business segment, we realized a tax benefit of approximately $47.0 million. Under our carriage agreement with AOL entered into in November 1999, we are required to pay $81.0 million to AOL over the life of the five year agreement. Of this amount, $36.0 million was paid upon signing the agreement with the remainder due in four equal annual installments beginning with the first anniversary of the initial payment. We made carriage payments to AOL of $11.25 million in each of the fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001. As of March 31, 2003, we have $11.25 million remaining on this commitment. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 hereof, for additional information. 50 Table of Contents Other Commitments Advertising Commitments AOL In our carriage agreement with AOL, we also made a commitment to spend $15.0 million in offline media advertisements prior to March 31, 2005 consisting of: $10.0 million on television, radio, print and outdoor advertising that promotes the availability of our online games on certain AOL online services; and $5.0 million ($1.0 million per year over the five year agreement) on television, radio, print and outdoor advertising that promotes the availability of a specific category of our online games (so called parlor games) on certain AOL online services. As of March 31, 2003, we have spent approximately $4.3 million against this commitment. We are not required to purchase any of the advertising from AOL or its affiliates. News America Corporation In addition, under an agreement amended on August 30, 2002, we made a commitment to spend $17.0 million in advertising with News America Corporation and its affiliates through the period ended December 31, 2006. As of March 31, 2003, we have fulfilled approximately $8.5 million of this commitment. See News America Corporation Exchange below. Lease Commitments We lease certain of our current facilities and certain equipment under non cancelable capital and operating lease agreements. We are required to pay property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs for certain of our facilities and will be required to pay any increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder of our facilities. In February 1995, we entered into a build to suit lease with Keybank National Association on our headquarters facility in Redwood City, California, which was extended in July 2001 and expires in July 2006. We accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, as amended. Existing campus facilities developed in phase one comprise a total of 350,000 square feet and provide space for sales, marketing, administration and research and development functions. We have an option to purchase the property (land and facilities) for $145.0 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for (1) an additional extension of the lease or (2) sale of the property to a third party with us retaining an obligation to the owner for the difference between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up to $128.9 million if the sales price is less than this amount. The lease also provides that a sale of the property to a third party is subject to remarketing conditions including marketing assistance, requisite repairs and maintenance, appropriate notice and sellers indemnities and warranties. In December 2000, we entered into a second build to suit lease with Keybank National Association for a five year term beginning December 2000 to expand our Redwood City, California headquarters facilities and develop adjacent property adding approximately 310,000 square feet to our campus. Construction was completed in June 2002. We accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, as amended. The facilities provide space for marketing, sales and research and development. We have an option to purchase the property for $127.0 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for (1) an extension of the lease or (2) sale of the property to a third party with us retaining an obligation to the owner for the difference between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up to $118.8 million if the sales price is less than this amount. The lease also provides that a sale of the property to a third party is subject to remarketing conditions including marketing assistance, requisite repairs and maintenance, appropriate notice and sellers indemnities and warranties. Lease rates are based upon the Commercial Paper Rate. The two lease agreements described above require us to maintain certain financial covenants related to consolidated net worth, fixed charge coverage 51 Table of Contents ratio, total consolidated debt to total consolidated capital and quick ratio, all of which we were in compliance with as of March 31, 2003. Letters of Credit In connection with our purchases of optical disks for our Nintendo GameCube titles distributed in North America, Nintendo requires us to provide irrevocable letters of credit prior to Nintendos acceptance of purchase orders from us for purchases of these optical disks. For purchases of optical disks for our Nintendo GameCube products distributed in Japan and Europe, Nintendo typically requires us to make cash deposits. In July 2002, we provided an irrevocable standby letter of credit to Nintendo of Europe. The standby letter of credit guarantees performance of our obligations to pay Nintendo of Europe for trade payables of up to 8.0 million Euros. The standby letter of credit expires in July 2005. At March 31, 2003, we had $0.3 million of payables to Nintendo of Europe covered by this standby letter of credit. Development, Celebrity, League and Content Licenses: Payments and Commitments The products produced by EA Studios are designed and created by our employee designers and artists and by non employee software developers (independent artists). We typically advance development funds to the independent artists during development of our games, usually in installment payments made upon the completion of specified development milestones, which payments are considered advances against subsequent royalties based on the sales of the products. These terms are typically set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists. In addition, we have certain celebrity, league and content license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments that are not dependent on any deliverables. Celebrities and organizations with whom we have contracts include: FIFA (soccer), NASCAR (stock car racing), John Madden (professional football), National Basketball Association, PGA TOUR (golf), Tiger Woods (golf), National Hockey League, Warner Bros. (Harry Potter), MGM/ Danjaq (James Bond), National Football League, Collegiate Licensing Company (collegiate football and basketball), ISC (stock car racing), Major League Baseball Properties, MLB Players Association (baseball) and Island Def Jam (wrestling). These developer and content license commitments represent the sum of (1) the cash payments due under non royalty bearing licenses and services agreements, and (2) the minimum payments and advances against royalties due under royalty bearing licenses and services agreements. These minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments are included in the table below. The following table summarized our minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of March 31, 2003 (in thousands), and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Commercial Contractual Obligations Commitments Developer/ Bank and Fiscal Year Licensee Other Letters of Ended March 31, Leases Advertising Commitments AOL Marketing Guarantees Credit Total 2004 $ 15,149 $ 6,178 $ 30,348 $ 11,250 $ 19,095 $ 362 $ 1,086 $ 83,468 2005 19,504 6,987 32,144 14,252 295 73,182 2006 19,623 3,000 29,564 9,692 295 62,174 2007 11,351 3,000 9,565 9,692 295 33,903 2008 7,952 11,733 9,692 294 29,671 Thereafter 8,102 11,949 16,952 294 37,297 $ 81,681 $ 19,165 $ 125,303 $ 11,250 $ 79,375 $ 1,835 $ 1,086 $ 319,695 As of March 31, 2003, we had $1.59 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. We believe that the existing cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and cash generated by our business 52 Table of Contents are adequate to enable us to meet our future minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments for at least the next 12 months. Transactions with Related Parties News America Corporation Exchange On February 7, 2000, we acquired Kesmai from News America Corporation (News Corp) in exchange for $22.5 million in cash and approximately 206,000 shares of our existing common stock valued at $8.65 million. Under the original agreements, we agreed to spend $12.5 million through the period ended June 1, 2002 in advertising with News Corp or any of its affiliates. In addition, under these agreements if certain conditions were met, including that a qualified public offering of Class B common stock did not occur within twenty four months of News Corps purchase of such shares and all of the Class B outstanding shares had been converted to Class A common stock, then (1) News Corp would have the right to (i) exchange Class B common stock for approximately 206,000 shares of Class A common stock, and (ii) receive cash from us in the amount of $9.65 million, and (2) we would agree to spend an additional $11.675 million in advertising with News Corp and its affiliates. On August 30, 2002, we entered into a new agreement with News Corp under which (i) News Corp exchanged its 2,000,000 shares of Class B common stock for 206,454 shares of Class A common stock and (ii) we paid News Corp $1.0 million in cash and committed to spend an additional $17.0 million in advertising with News Corp and its affiliates through the period ended December 31, 2006. All of our other obligations to News Corp under the original agreements were terminated. AOL Exchange In November 1999, we entered into a five year carriage agreement which gave us the exclusive right to provide online games and interactive entertainment content on the Games channels/areas of certain AOL online services and gain access to and sell our products to AOL subscribers and users. As part of this agreement, we sold to AOL 4,000,000 shares of Class B common stock for $20.0 million and a warrant to purchase an additional 2,000,000 shares of Class B common stock for $1.3 million. These shares were issued upon the authorization of the Class B common stock in March 2000. If a qualified public offering did not occur within one year following the initial sale of the shares to AOL, then at any time within four years thereafter, AOL had the right to exchange all shares of Class B common stock then owned for shares of Class A common stock. The exchange ratio was set at the ratio of the consideration paid for each share of Class B common stock and the average closing price of Class A common stock during the fifteen day period ending two days prior to execution of the carriage fee agreement with us. In the event of an exchange, the AOL warrant would be cancelled and exchanged for Class A common stock based on the price paid by AOL for the warrant divided by the average closing price of Class A common stock as described above. In February 2003, AOL exchanged its 4 million shares of Class B common stock for 446,323 shares of Class A common stock. As a result, the warrant issued to AOL to purchase an additional 2,000,000 shares of Class B common stock was automatically exchanged for 31,027 shares of Class A common stock. In total, AOL received 477,350 shares of Class A common stock in this exchange. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal use of the asset. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 143 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 53 Table of Contents In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities (VIEs) that either: (i) do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or (ii) the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest. This interpretation applies immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to VIEs in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. FIN 46 requires disclosure of VIEs in financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, if it is reasonably possible that as of the transition date: (i) the company will be the primary beneficiary of an existing VIE that will require consolidation or, (ii) the company will hold a significant variable interest in, or have significant involvement with, an existing VIE. We do not believe that we will have any entities that will require disclosure or new consolidation as a result of adopting the provisions of FIN 46. In January 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached consensus on Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF 00 21 provides guidance on how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables requires that such deliverables be accounted for separately. EITF 00 21 allows for prospective adoption for arrangements entered into after June 15, 2003 or adoption via a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principal. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of EITF 00 21 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. 54 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS Electronic Arts business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance. These risks and uncertainties are discussed below. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of the events or circumstances described below occurs, our business and financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline. If we do not develop products for widely accepted new video game platforms, our business will suffer. We derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on proprietary video game platforms of third parties, such as Sonys PlayStation 2. Therefore, the success of our products is driven in large part by the success of new video game hardware systems and our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful in the marketplace. We must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform. A new platform for which we are developing products may be delayed, may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated. If the platforms for which we are developing products are not released when anticipated or do not attain wide market acceptance, our revenue growth will suffer. If we do not accurately predict the importance to consumers of online game play for different console products, our sales may be limited in the future. Sony and Microsoft have introduced online game play for their respective PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles. We anticipate that Nintendo will do so for its GameCube console. We have agreed to support online game features for our Sony PlayStation 2 products but do not currently offer similar capability for our Xbox products. We currently cannot predict the importance to consumers of these features. If consumers consider online play capability to be a significant component of games for the Xbox, our sales of products for the Xbox would decline. Our business is both seasonal and cyclical. If we fail to deliver our products at the right times, our sales will suffer. Our business is highly seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand, and a significant percentage of our revenue, occurring in the December quarter. The timing of hardware platform introduction is often tied to the year end holiday season and is not within our control. If we miss this key selling period, due to product delays or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products, our sales will suffer disproportionately. Our industry is also cyclical. Video game platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years. As one group of platforms is reaching the end of its cycle and new platforms are emerging, consumers often defer game software purchases until the new platforms are available, causing sales to decline. This decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new platform. For example, the market for products for Sonys older PlayStation game console has dropped faster than expected since the launch of the PlayStation 2 platform. Our business is intensely competitive and increasingly hit driven. If we do not continue to deliver hit products, our success will be limited. Competition in our industry is intense, and new products are regularly introduced. During calendar year 2002, approximately 22 percent of the sales of videogames in North America consisted of only 20 hit products out of thousands published. These hit titles are increasingly expensive to produce. If our competitors develop more successful products, or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality products, our revenue will decline. 55 Table of Contents If we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to intellectual property, we will publish fewer hit titles and our revenue will decline. Many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others. For example, our EA SPORTS products include intellectual property licenses from the major sports leagues and players associations. Similarly, many of our hit EA Games titles such as James Bond, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, are based on key film and literary licenses. Competition for these licenses is intense. If we are unable to maintain these licenses and obtain additional licenses with significant commercial value, we will be unable to increase our revenue in the future. If patent claims continue to be asserted against us, we may be unable to sustain our current business models or profits. Many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used game technologies. Additionally, infringement claims under many recently issued patents are now being asserted against Internet implementations of existing games. Several such claims have been asserted against us. Such claims can harm our business. We incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims, regardless of the merits of the claims. In the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a third party patent, we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future. Other intellectual property claims may increase our product costs or require us to cease selling affected products. Many of our products include extremely realistic graphical images, and we expect that as technology continues to advance, images will become even more realistic. Some of the images and other content are based on real world examples that may inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others, it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement. From time to time, we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims. Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid or not, may be time consuming and expensive to defend. Such claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the affected products, redesign those products to avoid infringement, or obtain a license, all of which would be costly and harm our business. Our business, our products and our distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories of content, consumer privacy and online delivery. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our business may suffer. Legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution. For example, privacy laws in the United States and Europe impose various restrictions on our web sites. Those rules vary by territory although the Internet recognizes no geographical boundaries. Other countries, such as Germany, have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged goods and those transmitted over the Internet that are stricter than current United States laws. In the United States, the federal and several state governments are considering content restrictions on products such as ours, as well as restrictions on distribution of such products. Any one or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers and by requiring additional differentiation between products for different territories to address varying regulations. This additional product differentiation would be costly. If we do not consistently meet our product development schedules, we will experience fluctuations in our operating results. Product development schedules, particularly for new hardware platforms, high end multimedia PCs and the Internet, are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes, use of new development tools for new platforms and the learning process, research and experimentation associated with 56 Table of Contents development for new technologies. We have in the past experienced development delays for several of our products. Failure to meet anticipated production or go live schedules may cause a shortfall in our revenue and profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different from expectations. Delays that prevent release of our products during peak selling seasons may reduce lifetime sales of those products. Technology changes rapidly in our business, and if we fail to anticipate new technologies, the quality, timeliness and competitiveness of our products will suffer. Rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies our products must take advantage of in order to make them competitive in the market at the time they are released. Therefore, we usually start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve. We may not be able to achieve these goals, or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we can. In either case, our products may be technologically inferior to competitive products, or less appealing to consumers, or both. If we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products, then we may delay products until these technology goals can be achieved, which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses. Alternatively, we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies, either to preserve our product launch schedule or to keep up with our competition, which would increase our development expenses. If we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel, we will be unable to effectively conduct our business. The market for technical, creative, marketing and other personnel essential to the development of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive. In the last fiscal year, notwithstanding the downturn of the economy generally, competitive recruiting efforts aimed at our employees and executives continued. For example, in fiscal 2003, a team of employees that developed one of our hit Medal of Honor products left the company to develop products for a competitor. Our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent. In addition, the cost of real estate in the San Francisco Bay area the location of our headquarters and one of our largest studios remains high, and has made recruiting from other areas and relocating employees to our headquarters more difficult. If we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need, our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired. Our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of and or access to our video game products. If they do not approve our products, we will be unable to ship to our customers. Our agreements with hardware licensors (such as Sony for the PlayStation 2, Microsoft for the Xbox and Nintendo for the GameCube), who are also our chief competitors, typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products, which could, in certain circumstances, leave us unable to get our products approved, manufactured and shipped to customers. In most events, control of the approval and manufacturing process by the platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently. While we believe that our relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good, the potential for delay or refusal to approve or manufacture our products exists. Such occurrences would harm our business and our financial performance. In addition, as online capabilities for videogame platforms emerge, our platform licensors will control our ability to provide online game capabilities for our console platform products. Currently, both Microsoft and Sony provide online capabilities for Xbox and PlayStation 2 products, respectively. In each case, compatibility code and the consent of the licensor are required for us to include online capabilities in our products. In addition, the business model for Microsofts and Sonys online businesses for their videogame 57 Table of Contents products may compete with our online business. As these capabilities become more significant, the failure or refusal of our licensors to approve our products, or the successful deployment by these licensors of services competitive to ours may harm our business. Our international revenues are subject to currency fluctuations. For the year ended March 31, 2003 international net revenue comprised 42 percent of total consolidated net revenue. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002, international net revenue comprised 37 percent of total consolidated net revenue. We expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and growing portion of our revenue. Such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers. Additionally, foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies, which may fluctuate against the dollar. While we hedge against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot control translation issues. Our reported financial results could be affected if significant changes in current accounting principles are adopted. Recent actions and public comments from the SEC have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally. Similarly, Congress has considered a variety of bills that could affect certain accounting principles. The FASB and other regulatory accounting agencies have recently introduced several new or proposed accounting standards, such as accounting for stock options, some of which represent a significant change from current practices. Changes in our accounting for stock options could materially increase our reported expenses. Our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly. As a result of the factors discussed in this report and other factors that may arise in the future, the market price of our common stock historically has been, and we expect will continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations. These fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us, to changes in analysts earnings estimates, or to factors affecting the computer, software, Internet, entertainment, media or electronics businesses. 58 Table of Contents Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks, including the changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and prices. Foreign exchange contracts used to hedge foreign currency exposures and short term investments are subject to market risk. We do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We utilize foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures of underlying assets and liabilities, primarily certain intercompany receivables that are denominated in foreign currencies, thereby, limiting our risk. Our foreign exchange contracts are accounted for as derivatives whereby the gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses on open contracts at the end of each accounting period resulting from changes in the forward rate are recognized in earnings and are designed to offset gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. At March 31, 2003, we had foreign exchange contracts, all with maturities of less than one month to purchase and sell approximately $155.5 million in foreign currencies, primarily British Pounds, Swedish Krona, European Currency Units (Euro) and other currencies. Fair value represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate and the forward rate. The counterparties to these contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks. The risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material. Notwithstanding our efforts to manage foreign exchange risks, there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. The following table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts at March 31, 2003. The information is provided in U.S. dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount (forward amount), the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value. Weighted Average Contract Contract Amount Rate Fair Value (in (in thousands) thousands) Foreign currency to be sold under contract: British Pound $101,959 1.5686 $ 448 Swedish Krona 17,796 0.1148 (125) Euro 15,962 1.0642 (63) Japanese Yen 5,576 0.0083 (16) Australian Dollar 3,564 0.5940 (30) South African Rand 3,548 0.1223 (69) Norwegian Krone 2,842 0.1353 (9) Swiss Franc 1,447 0.7230 Danish Krone 1,289 0.1432 (7) New Zealand Dollar 1,098 0.5490 1 Brazilian Real 435 0.2899 (8) Total $155,516 $ 122 Foreign currency to be purchased under contract: British Pound $ 21,109 1.5643 $(190) Total $ 21,109 $(190) 59 Table of Contents While the contract amounts provide one measurement of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts (arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be settled on a net basis at our option. We control credit risk through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities. We also manage our interest rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity. At March 31, 2003, our cash equivalents and short term investments included debt securities of $1,270.2 million. Notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks, there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. The table below presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates of our investment portfolio at March 31, 2003: Average Interest Rate Cost Fair Value (Dollars in thousands) Cash equivalents(1) Variable rate 1.36% $632,568 $632,568 Short term investments(1)(2) Fixed rate 2.75% $633,205 $637,623 (1) See definition in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Maturity dates for short term investments range from 4 months to 36 months with call dates ranging from 0 months to 12 months. 60 Table of Contents
