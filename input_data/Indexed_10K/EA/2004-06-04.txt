Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW The following overview is a top level discussion of our operating results as well as the trends and drivers of our business. Management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for fiscal 2004, as well as our future prospects. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Form 10 K, including in Business, the remainder of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Risk Factors or the consolidated financial statements and related notes. About Electronic Arts We develop, market, publish and distribute interactive software games that are playable by consumers on home videogame machines (such as the Sony PlayStation 2, Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo GameCubeTM consoles), personal computers, hand held game machines (such as the Game Boy Advance) and online, over the Internet and other proprietary online networks. Many of our games are based on content that we license from others (e.g., Madden NFL Football, Harry PotterTM and FIFA Soccer), and many of our games are based on our own wholly owned intellectual property (e.g., The SimsTM, Medal of HonorTM). Our goal is to develop titles which appeal to the mass markets and, as a result, we develop, market, publish and distribute our games in over 100 countries, often translating and localizing them for sale in non English speaking countries. Our goal is to create software game franchises that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property. Examples of this are the annual iterations of our sports based franchises (e.g., NCAA Football and FIFA Soccer), titles based on long lived movie properties (e.g., James BondTM and Harry Potter) and wholly owned properties that can be successfully sequeled (e.g., The Sims and Medal of Honor). Overview of Fiscal 2004 Financial Results Net revenue for fiscal 2004 was $2,957.1 million, up 19.1 percent as compared with $2,482.2 million for fiscal 2003. We had 27 platinum titles (over one million units sold) in fiscal 2004 as compared to 22 platinum titles in 2003. In fiscal 2004, six franchises sold more than five million units: The Sims, Need for SpeedTM, Medal of Honor, FIFA Soccer, The Lord of the RingsTM and Madden NFL Football. Net income for fiscal 2004 was $577.3 million, an 82.1 percent increase over fiscal 2003. Diluted earnings per share increased 73.1 percent to $1.87 as compared with $1.08 for fiscal 2003. The growth in earnings was primarily driven by higher sales volume and increased gross margin. Operating cash flow was $669.3 million as compared with $714.5 million for fiscal 2003. The decline was primarily a result of the timing of sales during the fourth quarter. Managements Overview of Historical and Prospective Business Trends Sales of Hit Titles. During fiscal 2004, sales of a number of hit titles contributed to our revenue growth, several of which were top sellers across a number of international markets. Our top five selling titles across all platforms worldwide in fiscal 2004 were Need for Speed TM Underground, Madden NFL 2004, The Lord of the RingsTM; The Return of the KingTM, Medal of HonorTM Rising Sun and FIFA Soccer 2004. Hit titles are important to our financial performance because they benefit from overall economies of scale. We have developed, and it is our objective to continue to develop, many of our hit titles to become franchise titles that can be regularly iterated. Increased Console Installed Base. As consumers purchase the current generation of consoles, either as first time buyers or by upgrading from a previous generation, the console installed base increases. As the installed base for a particular console increases, we are generally able to increase our unit volume; however, as consumers anticipate the next generation of consoles, unit volumes often decrease. In the U.S. and Europe, 21 Table of Contents we believe the installed base for the current generation of consoles PlayStation2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube increased over 30 percent, 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively, during fiscal 2004. Accordingly, we believe the significant increase in the installed base for these consoles was a contributing factor to our net revenue growth in fiscal 2004. In March 2004, Microsoft reduced the retail price of its Xbox consoles in the U.S. and in May 2004 Sony did the same with its PlayStation2 consoles. As price reductions drive sales of consoles and the related installed base of these current generation consoles increases during fiscal 2005, we expect unit sales of current generation titles to remain strong. Software Prices. As current generation console prices decrease, we expect more value oriented consumers to become part of the interactive entertainment software market. We experienced this trend several years ago when prices were reduced on previous generation consoles (e.g., Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64). We believe that hit titles will continue to be launched at premium price points and will maintain those premium price points longer than less popular games, however, as a result of a more value oriented consumer base, and a greater number of software titles being published, we expect average software prices to gradually come down, which we expect to negatively impact our gross margin. International Sales Growth. Our fiscal 2004 net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately 45 percent of our worldwide net revenue, up from 42 percent in fiscal 2003. Our fiscal 2004 increase in international net revenue was driven primarily by increased sales in Europe. In fiscal 2005, we anticipate that international net revenue will continue to increase as a percentage of our worldwide net revenue, although not at the same rate as in fiscal 2004, as we strengthen our presence in new territories and as the console installed base expands more rapidly outside of North America. Foreign Exchange Impact. Given that a significant portion of our business is conducted internationally in foreign currency, fluctuations in currency prices can have a material impact on our results of operations. For example, the average exchange rate for one Euro, as compared to the U.S. dollar, increased from $0.99 in fiscal 2003 to $1.17 in fiscal 2004. We estimate that we had a total foreign exchange benefit on net revenue of approximately $156 million during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. Although we intend to continue to utilize foreign exchange forward and option contracts to either mitigate or hedge against some foreign currency exposures, we cannot predict the effect foreign currency fluctuations will have on us in fiscal 2005. Increasing Cost of Titles. Hit titles have become increasingly more expensive to produce and market as the platforms on which they are played continue to advance technologically and consumers demand continual improvements in the overall gameplay experience. We expect this trend to continue as we require larger production teams to create our titles, the technology needed to develop titles becomes more complex, we continue to develop and expand the online gaming capabilities included in our products and we develop new methods to distribute our content via the Internet. Any increase in the cost of licensing third party intellectual property used in our products would also make these products more expensive to publish. Expansion of Studio Resources and Technology. During fiscal 2004, as part of our effort to more efficiently utilize our resources and technology, we expanded our studio facilities in Los Angeles and Vancouver, allowing us to consolidate several smaller studios and resources. In fiscal 2005, we expect to devote significant resources primarily to the expansion of our studios in North America and Europe. As we move through the life cycle of current generation consoles, we will devote increased resources to developing current generation titles, and increase spending associated with tools and technologies for the next generation of consoles. We expect to develop more titles internally as a result of our studio expansions. We expect these activities to increase our research and development expenses and decrease our third party development costs, both as a percentage of net revenue. In addition, we expect the decrease in third party development costs to positively impact our gross margin. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and 22 Table of Contents liabilities, and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown. As a result, actual results may differ materially from our estimates. Sales Returns and Allowances and Bad Debt Reserves We principally derive revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on videogame platforms (such as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube), PCs and hand held game machines (such as the Nintendo Game Boy Advance). Product revenue is recognized net of sales allowances. We also have stock balancing programs for our PC products, which allow for the exchange of PC products by resellers under certain circumstances. We may decide to provide price protection for both our personal computer and videogame system products. In making this determination, we evaluate inventory remaining in the channel, the rate of inventory sell through in the channel, and our remaining inventory on hand. It is our general practice to exchange products or give credits, rather than give cash refunds. We estimate potential future product returns, price protection and stock balancing programs related to current period product revenue. We analyze historical returns, current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products, current trends in the videogame market and the overall economy, changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and price protection allowances. In addition, management monitors and manages the volume of our sales to retailers and distributors and their inventories, as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel can result in high returns or substantial price protection requirements in subsequent periods. In the past, actual returns have not generally exceeded our reserves. However, actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. For example, the risk of product returns for our products may increase as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube consoles pass the midpoint of their lifecycle and an increasing number and aggregate amount of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures. While management believes it can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates changed, our returns reserves would change, which would impact the net revenue we report. For example, if actual returns were significantly greater than the reserves we have established, our actual results would decrease our reported net revenue. Conversely, if actual returns were significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our reported net revenue. Similarly, significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period. We determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends. Depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers, the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly. We cannot predict customer bankruptcies or an inability of any of our customers to meet their financial obligations to us. Therefore, our estimates could differ materially from actual results. Royalties & Licenses Our royalty expenses consist of payments to (1) co publishing and or distribution affiliates, (2) content licensors, and (3) independent software developers. Co publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for delivery of product. License royalties consist of payments made to celebrities, professional sports organizations, movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademark, copyright, personal publicity rights, content and or other intellectual property. Royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games. 23 Table of Contents Royalty based payments made to content licensors and distribution affiliates that are paid in advance are generally capitalized as prepaid royalties and expensed to cost of goods sold at the greater of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales. With regard to payments made to independent software developers and co publishing affiliates, we are generally subject to development risk prior to the general release of the product. Accordingly, payments that are due prior to completion of the product are generally expensed as research and development as the services are incurred. Payments due after completion of the product (primarily royalty based in nature) are generally expensed as cost of goods sold at the higher of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales. Each quarter, we also evaluate the future realization of any prepaid royalties as well as minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales. Any impairments determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense. Impairments determined post launch are charged to cost of goods sold. In either case, we rely on estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties. If actual revenue, or revised sales estimates, fall below the initial sales estimate, then the actual charge taken may be greater in any given quarter than anticipated. As of March 31, 2004 we had $22.7 million of prepaid royalty assets and approximately $130.3 million in future obligations to our co publishing and or distribution affiliates and content licensors that could be impaired if our sales estimates changed. Valuation of Long Lived Assets We evaluate both purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets in order to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in value exists. This evaluation requires us to estimate, among other things, the remaining useful lives of the assets and future cash flows of the business. These evaluations and estimates require the use of judgment. Our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates. Under current accounting standards, we make judgments about the remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. In order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred, management makes various assumptions about the future value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows. Our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play on proprietary videogame consoles, hand held game machines and PCs (platforms). The success of our products is affected by our ability to accurately predict which platforms and which products we develop will be successful. Also, our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules. Due to product sales shortfalls, we may not realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our long lived assets, which may result in an impairment charge being recorded in the future. We recorded $0.5 million of impairment charges on long lived assets during fiscal 2004, $66.3 million during fiscal 2003 and $12.8 million in fiscal 2002. Income Taxes In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods. This process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction where we operate. These estimates involve complex issues, require extended periods of time to resolve, and require us to make judgments, such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns. We are also required to make the determinations of the need to record deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is established to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction. In addition, changes in our business, including the geographic mix of income, as well as changes in valuation allowances, the applicable accounting rules, the applicable tax laws and regulations and interpretations 24 Table of Contents thereof, developments in tax audit matters, and estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we resolved certain tax related matters with the Internal Revenue Service, which lowered our income tax expense by $19.7 million and resulted in a 2.5 percent rate reduction. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our fiscal year is reported on a 52/53 week period that ends on the final Saturday of March in each year. The results of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 each contain 52 weeks and ended on March 27, 2004, March 29, 2003 and March 30, 2002, respectively. For simplicity of presentation, all fiscal periods are treated as ending on a calendar month end. On October 20, 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two for one stock split of our Class A common stock which was distributed on November 17, 2003 in the form of a stock dividend for shareholders of record at the close of business on November 3, 2003. All issued and outstanding share and per share amounts related to the Class A common stock have been restated to reflect the stock split for all periods presented. Comparison of Fiscal 2004 to Fiscal 2003 Net Revenue We principally derive net revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on videogame consoles (such as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube), PCs and hand held game machines (such as the Nintendo Game Boy Advance). Additionally, in Europe and Asia we generate a significant portion of net revenue by marketing and selling third party interactive software games through our established distribution network. We also derive net revenue from selling subscriptions to online games, programming third party web sites, allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products, and selling advertisements on our online web pages. From a geographical perspective, our net revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004 and 2003 was as follows (in thousands): Year Ended March 31, Increase/ % 2004 2003 (Decrease) Change North America $ 1,609,539 $ 1,435,718 $ 173,821 12.1 % Europe 1,180,274 878,904 301,370 34.3 % Asia Pacific 96,708 87,569 9,139 10.4 % Japan 70,620 80,053 (9,433 ) (11.8 %) International 1,347,602 1,046,526 301,076 28.8 % Consolidated Net Revenue $ 2,957,141 $ 2,482,244 $ 474,897 19.1 % North America For fiscal 2004, net revenue in North America increased by 12.1 percent as compared to fiscal 2003. From a franchise perspective, the net revenue increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products released during the year ended March 31, 2004 in the following eight franchises: Need for SpeedTM, NBA STREET, NFL STREET, Madden NFL, Def JamTM, SSX, Tiger Woods/ PGA TOUR and MVP BaseballTM. Increased sales in these franchises resulted in increased net revenue of $353.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2003. Increases in net revenue from these franchises were partially offset by (1) a decrease in our Harry Potter franchise, as the fiscal 2004 title, Harry PotterTM: QuidditchTM World Cup, had no associated movie release, while our fiscal 2003 product, Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsTM, was released in conjunction with the blockbuster movie of the same title, (2) the termination of our Square EA joint venture agreement, and (3) a decrease in net revenue in our 25 Table of Contents Bond franchise as a result of the timing of the release of James Bond 007 TM: Everything or NothingTM (on all platforms except the Game Boy Advance) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, as compared to the strong sales of James Bond 007: NIGHTFIRE TM, which was released in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Together, lower sales in these franchises reduced net revenue by $176.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2003. Europe For fiscal 2004, net revenue in Europe increased by 34.3 percent as compared to fiscal 2003. We estimate foreign exchange rates (primarily the Euro and the British pound sterling) strengthened reported European net revenue by approximately $136 million or 15 percent for the year ended March 31, 2004. From a franchise perspective, the net revenue increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products released during the year ended March 31, 2004 in the following eleven franchises: Need for Speed, The Sims, FIFA Soccer, Lord of the RingsTM, Medal of Honor, Final Fantasy, SSX, Football Manager, Freedom Fighters, Tiger Woods/ PGA TOUR and Rugby. Increased sales in these franchises resulted in an increase in net revenue of $372.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2003. The increase was partially offset by (1) a decrease in our Harry Potter franchise, as the fiscal 2004 title, Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup, had no associated movie release, while our fiscal 2003 product, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was released in conjunction with the blockbuster movie of the same title, and (2) an expected decrease in sales of our World Cup franchise due to strong sales in the year ended March 31, 2003 in conjunction with the World Cup event and no similar event in the year ended March 31, 2004. Together, the two items noted above, reduced net revenue by $92.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2003. Asia Pacific For fiscal 2004, net revenue from sales in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan, increased by 10.4 percent as compared to fiscal 2003. The growth in net revenue was driven by the Need for Speed, The Sims and other franchises, partially offset by declines in the Harry Potter and World Cup franchises. We estimate foreign exchange rates strengthened reported Asia Pacific net revenue by approximately $15 million or 17 percent, for the year ended March 31, 2004. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates, we estimate that Asia Pacific net revenue decreased by approximately $6 million or 7 percent, for the year ended March 31, 2004. Japan For fiscal 2004, net revenue from sales in Japan decreased by 11.8 percent as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to declines in sales in the World Cup, Harry Potter and Final Fantasy franchises. In addition, we estimate that favorable changes in foreign exchange rates offset the decline in reported net revenue in Japan by approximately $6 million or 7 percent, for the year ended March 31, 2004. 26 Table of Contents Our worldwide net revenue by product line for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was as follows (in thousands): Year Ended March 31, Increase/ % 2004 2003 (Decrease) Change PlayStation 2 $ 1,314,758 44.4 % $ 910,693 36.7 % $ 404,065 44.4 % PC 469,692 15.9 % 499,634 20.2 % (29,942 ) (6.0 %) Xbox 384,320 13.0 % 219,378 8.8 % 164,942 75.2 % Nintendo GameCube 199,893 6.8 % 176,656 7.1 % 23,237 13.2 % Game Boy Advance 77,305 2.6 % 79,093 3.2 % (1,788 ) (2.3 %) Subscription Services 49,514 1.7 % 44,648 1.8 % 4,866 10.9 % PlayStation 29,619 1.0 % 99,951 4.0 % (70,332 ) (70.4 %) EA Studio Net Product Revenue 2,525,101 85.4 % 2,030,053 81.8 % 495,048 24.4 % Co publishing and Distribution 398,221 13.5 % 375,759 15.1 % 22,462 6.0 % Advertising, Programming, Licensing, and Other 33,819 1.1 % 76,432 3.1 % (42,613 ) (55.8 %) Total Net Revenue $ 2,957,141 100.0 % $ 2,482,244 100.0 % $ 474,897 19.1 % PlayStation 2 Net revenue from PlayStation 2 products increased from $910.7 million in fiscal 2003 to $1,314.8 million in fiscal 2004. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of PlayStation 2 products increased by 7.7 percent in fiscal 2004. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in the installed base and greater demand for our products. PC Net revenue from PC based products decreased from $499.6 million in fiscal 2003 to $469.7 million in fiscal 2004. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of PC products decreased by 4.3 percent in fiscal 2004. PC net revenue declined, largely due to declines of sales in the Harry Potter, World Cup and Bond franchises as discussed above, which were partially offset by an increase in sales of the Lord of the Rings franchise. Xbox Net revenue from Xbox products increased from $219.4 million in fiscal 2003 to $384.3 million in fiscal 2004. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of Xbox products increased by 4.2 percent in fiscal 2004. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in the installed base and greater demand for our products. Nintendo GameCube Net revenue from Nintendo GameCube products increased from $176.7 million in fiscal 2003 to $199.9 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in the installed base of the Nintendo GameCube. Subscription Services In fiscal 2004, net revenue from subscription services products increased by $4.9 million to $49.5 million as compared to fiscal 2003. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to the number of users for Club Pogo (launched in July 2003) and Pogo Downloadables (launched in May 2003), partially offset by a decrease in 27 Table of Contents subscription net revenue from The SimsTM Online, Ultima OnlineTM, and Earth & Beyond TM subscription services. PlayStation In fiscal 2004, net revenue from PlayStation products decreased by $70.3 million to $29.6 million as compared to fiscal 2003. We anticipated the decline in net revenue from PlayStation products as we continued to transition away from that platform. Although our PlayStation products are playable on the PlayStation 2 console, we expect sales of current PlayStation products to continue to decline in the future. Co Publishing and Distribution In fiscal 2004, net revenue from co publishing and distribution products increased by $22.5 million to $398.2 million as compared to fiscal 2003. The increase was due to a $74.5 million increase in Europe primarily from increased sales in the Final Fantasy, Freedom Fighters and Battlefield franchises, partially offset by a decline in the Kingdom Hearts franchise in North America. Although co publishing and distribution net revenue increased, it declined as a percentage of net revenue. Advertising, Programming, Licensing and Other In fiscal 2004, net revenue from advertising, programming, licensing and other products decreased by $42.6 million to $33.8 million as compared to fiscal 2003. The decrease was a result of expected declines in our advertising and programming net revenue following our renegotiation of the terms of our relationship with AOL during the three months ended June 30, 2003 and an expected decline in our Game Boy Color net revenue as we transitioned away from that platform. Operations by Segment In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of the EA.com business segment into our core business. We now consider online capability and gameplay to be integral to our existing and future products. Accordingly, beginning April 1, 2003, we no longer manage our online products and services as a separate business segment, and we have consolidated the reporting related to our online products and services into reporting for the overall development and publication of our core products for all reporting periods ending after that date. We believe that this will better reflect the way in which our Chief Executive Officer (our chief operating decision maker) reviews and manages our business and reflects the importance of our online products and services relative to the rest of our business. Concurrently, we have also eliminated separate reporting for our Class B common stock for all reporting periods ending after April 1, 2003. Fiscal 2003 and 2002 have been restated to conform with our fiscal 2004 presentation. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 hereof. Our view and reporting of business segments may change due to changes in underlying business facts and circumstances and the evolution of our reporting to our Chief Executive Officer. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold for our disk based and cartridge based products consists of (1) product costs, (2) certain royalty expenses for celebrities, professional sports and other organizations and independent software developers, (3) manufacturing royalties, net of volume discounts, (4) expenses for defective products, (5) write off of post launch prepaid royalty costs, and (6) operations expenses. Cost of goods sold for our online product subscription business consists primarily of data center and bandwidth costs associated with hosting our websites, credit card fees and royalties for use of third party properties. Cost of goods sold for our website advertising business primarily consists of ad serving costs. 28 Table of Contents Costs of goods sold for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 (in thousands): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2004 Revenue 2003 Revenue % Change $1,102,950 37.3 % $ 1,072,802 43.2 % 2.8 % In fiscal 2004, cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 5.9 percentage points to 37.3 percent from 43.2 percent for fiscal 2003 primarily due to a 3.3 percent decrease in product costs and a 2.8 percent decrease in royalty rates. The 3.3 percent decrease in product costs was primarily a result of: n Lower co publishing and distribution product costs, as a percentage of net revenue, due to a higher mix of co publishing titles relative to distribution titles in fiscal 2004. Co publishing titles generally have higher gross margins than distribution titles. Lower co publishing and distribution costs, as a percentage of net revenue, increased total gross margin by 1.6 percent in fiscal 2004. n Lower average manufacturing costs increased total gross margin by 1.0 percent in fiscal 2004. n Lower period costs primarily due to improved inventory management in North America. Lower period costs increased total gross margin by 0.5 percent in fiscal 2004. The 2.8 percent decrease in royalty rates was primarily the result of: n Decreased third party development royalties primarily due to a higher mix of titles developed internally rather than externally in fiscal 2004. Significant titles that were developed internally in fiscal 2004 for which a comparable title had been developed externally in fiscal 2003 included James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing and The Lord of the Rings; The Return of the King. We estimate that lower development royalties increased gross margin by 1.9 percent, which was spread across multiple platforms. n Lower license royalties, as a percentage of net revenue, as Need for Speed Underground, our highest grossing title of fiscal 2004, had a significantly lower license royalty rate than Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, our highest grossing title of fiscal 2003. Lower license royalties, as a percentage of net revenue, increased total gross margin by 1.1 percent in fiscal 2004. We expect cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue to increase in fiscal 2005 as a result of (1) a gradual decrease in the average selling price due to the current generation lifecycle, (2) overall product mix, and (3) higher license royalties as a percentage of net revenue. Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expenses consist of personnel related costs and advertising, marketing and promotional expenses, net of advertising expense reimbursements from third parties. In fiscal 2003, marketing and sales expense also included the amortization of the carriage fees payable for the distribution of our online games on AOL, which we are no longer required to pay. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 hereof. Marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 (in thousands): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2004 Revenue 2003 Revenue $ Change % Change $370,468 12.5 % $ 332,453 13.4 % $ 38,015 11.4 % Marketing and sales expenses increased by 11.4 percent in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to: n An increase in our advertising, contract services and promotional expenses of $38.0 million as we incrementally increased our advertising campaigns to support the release of new titles. 29 Table of Contents n A 13.6 percent increase in average headcount to further support the growth of our marketing and sales functions worldwide, which resulted in an increase to personnel related costs of approximately $16.5 million. The increase in marketing and sales expenses was partially offset by the discontinuance of carriage fee payments to AOL, which resulted in a decrease of $17.9 million. As a percentage of net revenue, marketing and sales expenses declined from 13.4 percent in fiscal 2003 to 12.5 percent in fiscal 2004. Marketing and sales expenses included vendor reimbursements for advertising expenses of $44.8 million in fiscal 2004 and $28.2 million in fiscal 2003. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related expenses of executive and administrative staff, fees for professional services such as legal and accounting, and allowances for bad debts.

The increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of $9.1 million, primarily as a result of collecting on accounts that we had previously deemed uncollectible. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred by our production studios for personnel related costs, consulting, equipment depreciation and any impairment of prepaid royalties for pre launch products. Research and development expenses for our online business include expenses incurred by our studios consisting of direct development costs and related overhead costs in connection with the development and production of our online games. Research and development expenses also include expenses associated with development of website content, network infrastructure direct expenses, software licenses and maintenance, and network and management overhead.

The increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and other operating expenses due to asset impairments recognized in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003. We expected increased research and development expenses in fiscal 2004 as we continued to support the global growth of our research and development capabilities. In recent quarters, we have developed a greater number of titles internally. We expect increased research and development spending to continue in fiscal 2005 due to the development of next generation tools and technologies and to a lesser extent, increased spending on current generation console products including the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube, as well as extending our investment in the development of games for the PC.

The studio closures were the result of a strategic decision to consolidate local development efforts in Redwood City, California. We recorded total pre tax charges of $9.2 million, consisting of $7.0 million for consolidation of facilities, $1.7 million for workforce reductions and $0.5 million for the write off of non current assets, primarily leasehold improvements. The facilities charge included contractual rental commitments under the real estate lease for unutilized office space at our Walnut Creek location, offset by estimated future sub lease income. The exit plans resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 117 personnel in development and administrative departments, the majority of whom are expected to be terminated in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. In addition, we also expect immaterial charges to be incurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2005, primarily related to the Texas facility relocation. Fiscal 2003 Studio Restructuring During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we closed our office located in San Francisco, California and our studio located in Seattle, Washington. The office and studio closures were the result of a strategic decision to consolidate local development efforts in Redwood City, California and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. We recorded total pre tax charges of $9.4 million, consisting of $7.3 million for consolidation of facilities, $1.5 million for the write off of non current assets, primarily leasehold improvements, and $0.6 million for workforce reductions. The facilities charge was net of a reduction in deferred rent of $0.5 million. The exit plans resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 33 personnel in development and administrative 31 Table of Contents departments. The estimated costs for consolidation of facilities included contractual rental commitments under the real estate lease for unutilized office space, offset by estimated future sub lease income. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we approved a plan to consolidate the Los Angeles, California, Irvine, California and Las Vegas, Nevada, studios into one major game studio in Los Angeles. These measures were taken in order to maximize efficiencies and streamline the creative development process and operations of our studios. In connection with these consolidation activities, we recorded a total pre tax restructuring charge of $5.1 million, including $1.6 million for the shutdown of facilities related to non cancelable lease payments for permanently vacated properties and associated costs, $2.0 million for the write off of abandoned equipment and leasehold improvements at facilities that were permanently vacated and $1.5 million for employee severance expenses related to involuntary terminations. Fiscal 2003 Online Restructuring In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of EA.com into our core business, and eliminated separate reporting for its Class B common stock for all future reporting periods after fiscal 2003. We consider online functionality to be an integral component of our existing and future products. During fiscal 2003, we recorded restructuring charges, including asset impairment, of $67.0 million, consisting of $1.8 million for workforce reductions, $2.3 million for consolidation of facilities and other administrative charges, and $62.9 million for the write off of non current assets. The estimated costs for workforce reduction included severance charges for terminated employees, costs for certain outplacement service contracts and costs associated with the tender offer to retire employee Class B options. The workforce reduction resulted in the termination of approximately 50 positions. The consolidation of facilities resulted in the closure of EA.coms Chicago and Virginia facilities and an adjustment for the closure of EA.coms San Diego studio in fiscal 2002. The estimated costs for consolidation of facilities and other administrative charges included contractual rental commitments under real estate leases for unutilized office space reduced by estimated future sub lease income and costs to close the facilities. As part of the restructuring efforts, we performed impairment tests under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, to evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets and remaining finite lived identifiable intangible assets utilized in the EA.com business. This test was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 in conjunction with the overall valuation of the EA.com legal entity and its Class B common stock. In February 2003, our only outside holder of Class B common stock, AOL, exercised its right to exchange its Class B shares for shares of Class A common stock. In late December 2002, EA.com launched The Sims Online, an online game based on our The Sims line of PC games, which have sold over 20 million units worldwide. The Sims Online was expected to be EA.coms flagship online subscription offering. As of March 31, 2003, the number of units sold and the number of subscribers for this product along with other EA.com revenue were significantly below our expectations. We considered these developments to be a triggering event under SFAS No. 144, which caused us to cancel most of our plans to develop similar online products that would have utilized long lived assets associated with the EA.com business. Impairment charges on long lived assets amounted to $62.9 million and included $24.9 million relating to impaired customized internal use software systems for the EA.com infrastructure, $25.6 million for other long lived assets and $12.4 million of finite lived intangibles impairment charges relating to EA.coms acquisitions of Kesmai Corporation and Pogo Corporation (now referred to as Kesmai and Pogo, respectively) studios. As of March 31, 2003, there were no finite lived intangible balances remaining related to Kesmai and Pogo studios. In conjunction with our annual policy to reassess the remaining useful lives of goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles and test the recoverability of these long lived assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142, our fair value based tests did not indicate an impairment of our recorded goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles at the EA.com reporting unit level as of January 1, 2003. The remaining portion of Kesmai goodwill assets as of March 31, 2003 was $13.8 million. The remaining portion of Pogo goodwill assets as of March 31, 2003 was $15.9 million. There are no assurances that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings and a corresponding write down of goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles. 32 Table of Contents The following table reflects our unaudited pro forma consolidated basic earnings per share for the fiscal years ended 2003 and 2002 as if the consolidation of the operations of our EA.com business segment into our core business had occurred at the beginning of each of the periods presented (in thousands, except per share data): Year Ended March 31, 2003 2002 Net income: As reported $ 317,097 $ 101,509 Pro forma $ 317,097 $ 101,509 Earnings per share: As reported $ 1.17 $ 0.45 Pro forma $ 1.12 $ 0.37 Number of shares used in computation: As reported 281,978 273,665 Add: conversion of AOL and News Corp Class B 1,028 1,368 Pro forma 283,006 275,033 All restructuring charges recorded prior to December 31, 2002 were recorded in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring), EITF No. 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination, and Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 100, Restructuring and Impairment Charges. All restructuring charges recorded subsequent to December 31, 2002 were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Adjustments to the restructuring reserves will be made in future periods, if necessary, based upon the then current events and circumstances.

Income Taxes Income taxes for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 (in thousands): March 31, Effective March 31, Effective 2004 Tax Rate 2003 Tax Rate % Change $219,268 27.5 % $ 143,049 31.0 % 53.3 % 33 Table of Contents Our effective income tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from significant operations outside the U.S., which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent. The effective income tax rate was 27.5 percent for fiscal 2004 and 31.0 percent for fiscal 2003. The reduced effective income tax rate in fiscal 2004 primarily reflects the resolution of certain tax related matters with the Internal Revenue Service in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, which lowered our income tax expense by $19.7 million and resulted in a 2.5 percent rate reduction and a change in the geographic mix of taxable income subject to lower tax rates. We intend to indefinitely reinvest our international earnings outside the U.S. and, accordingly, have not provided U.S. taxes that would be incurred if such earnings were repatriated back to the U.S. Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $738.3 million at March 31, 2004. We are currently projecting an effective income tax rate of approximately 29 percent for fiscal 2005. An effective income tax rate projection, which is inherently uncertain, is based on current tax law and current projections of the mix of income in various taxing jurisdictions and assumes no material changes in our business or the applicable tax or accounting rules. Our actual effective income tax rates for fiscal 2005 and future periods can differ from the projected effective income tax rates due to a variety of factors, including changes in our business that were not taken into account in connection with our projection, a variation between the projected and actual mix of income between international and domestic operations, changes or interpretations to applicable tax laws and regulations, changes in the applicable accounting rules or our ability to realize deferred tax assets, or developments in tax audit matters with various tax authorities. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we resolved certain tax related matters with the Internal Revenue Service, which lowered our income tax expense by $19.7 million and resulted in a 2.5 percent rate reduction. Finally, our projected effective income tax rate for fiscal 2005 does not take into account a new election that is available under the U.S. income tax rules regarding the allocation between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions tax deductions attributable to employee stock option compensation. If we take advantage of this election, it could detrimentally affect our effective income tax rate. We have not yet determined the impact that the election would have on our reported results. Net Income Net income for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 (in thousands): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2004 Revenue 2003 Revenue $ Change % Change $577,292 19.5 % $ 317,097 12.8 % $ 260,195 82.1 % Reported net income increased in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to the reasons discussed above. Although the dollar amount of our expenses increased in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, net income as a percentage of net revenue increased to 19.5 percent as compared to 12.8 percent in fiscal 2003 because expenses, including our cost of goods sold, grew at a slower rate than did our net revenue. 34 Table of Contents Comparison of Fiscal 2003 to Fiscal 2002 Net Revenue From a geographical perspective, our net revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 was as follows (in thousands): Year Ended March 31, Increase/ % 2003 2002 (Decrease) Change North America $ 1,435,718 $ 1,093,244 $ 342,474 31.3 % Europe 878,904 519,458 359,446 69.2 % Asia Pacific 87,569 53,376 34,193 64.1 % Japan 80,053 58,597 21,456 36.6 % International 1,046,526 631,431 415,095 65.7 % Consolidated Net Revenue $ 2,482,244 $ 1,724,675 $ 757,569 43.9 % North America For fiscal 2003, net revenue in North America increased by 31.3 percent as compared to fiscal 2002. From a franchise perspective, the net revenue increase was primarily driven by sales of products released during the year ended March 31, 2003 in the following nine franchises: Medal of Honor, Lord of the Rings, Kingdom Hearts, The Sims, Need for Speed, Harry Potter, NCAA Football, Bond and Tiger Woods/ PGA TOUR. Increased sales in these franchises resulted in increased net revenue of $451.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2002. The increase was offset by decreases in net revenue in our Final Fantasy, SSX and NBA Street franchises as none of these franchises had products released during fiscal 2003. Together, decreased sales in these franchises reduced net revenue by $108.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2002. Europe For fiscal 2003, net revenue in Europe increased by 69.2 percent as compared to fiscal 2002. From a franchise perspective, the net revenue increase was primarily driven by sales of products released during the year ended March 31, 2003 in the following eleven franchises: Lord of the Rings, Medal of Honor, The Sims, FIFA Soccer, Bond, World Cup, Harry Potter, Need for Speed, Battlefield, SimCityTM and Tiger Woods/ PGA TOUR. Increased sales in these franchises resulted in increased net revenue of $345.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2002. Asia Pacific For fiscal 2003, net revenue from sales in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan, increased by 64.1 percent compared to the year ended March 31, 2002. Our net revenue from sales of products on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox platforms increased by $15.7 and $6.3 million, respectively, for the year ended March 31, 2003 primarily due to the higher installed base on both platforms and the fact that 20 Xbox titles were available in the Asia Pacific region in 2003 as compared to three in 2002. Sales of co publishing and distribution titles increased $11.1 million primarily due to sales of Final Fantasy X and Battlefield 1942 in fiscal 2003. Japan For fiscal 2003, net revenue from sales in Japan increased by 36.6 percent compared to fiscal 2002. The increase was due primarily to the higher PlayStation 2 installed base and strong sales of PlayStation 2 titles, most notably Medal of Honor FrontlineTM, 2002 FIFA World Cup and Project FIFA World Cup which generated an additional $15.7 million in net revenue in fiscal 2003. We also had an increase in revenues from co publishing and distribution products of $11.0 million due in large part to sales of Final Fantasy 11. These increases were offset by a decrease in PlayStation revenue of $5.7 million. 35 Table of Contents Our worldwide net revenue by product line for fiscal 2003 and 2002 was as follows (in thousands): Year Ended March 31, Increase/ % 2003 2002 (Decrease) Change PlayStation 2 $ 910,693 36.7 % $ 482,882 28.0 % $ 427,811 88.6 % PC 499,634 20.2 % 456,292 26.5 % 43,342 9.5 % Xbox 219,378 8.8 % 78,363 4.5 % 141,015 180.0 % Nintendo GameCube 176,656 7.1 % 51,740 3.0 % 124,916 241.4 % Game Boy Advance 79,093 3.2 % 43,653 2.5 % 35,440 81.2 % Subscription Services 44,648 1.8 % 34,236 2.0 % 10,412 30.4 % PlayStation 99,951 4.0 % 189,535 11.0 % (89,584 ) (47.3 %) EA Studio Net Product Revenue 2,030,053 81.8 % 1,336,701 77.5 % 693,352 51.9 % Co publishing and Distribution 375,759 15.1 % 269,010 15.6 % 106,749 39.7 % Advertising, Programming, Licensing, and Other 76,432 3.1 % 118,964 6.9 % (42,532 ) (35.8 %) Total Net Revenue $ 2,482,244 100.0 % $ 1,724,675 100.0 % $ 757,569 43.9 % PlayStation 2 Net revenue from sales of PlayStation 2 products increased from $482.9 million in fiscal 2002 to $910.7 million in fiscal 2003. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of PlayStation 2 products increased by 8.7 percent in fiscal 2003. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in the installed base and greater demand for our products. For example, in the U.S., the installed base for the PlayStation 2 increased approximately 115 percent, as compared to fiscal 2002, due in part to Sonys hardware price cut in North America in May 2002. PC Net revenue from sales of titles for the PC increased in fiscal 2003 by 9.5 percent to $499.6 million as compared to $456.3 million in fiscal 2002. The increase was primarily due to strong sales of The Sims franchise titles, and the release of SimCity 4 TM, for a combined increase of $71.0 million, partially offset by lower net revenue from fiscal 2002 releases Black and White TM and Dune Emperor totaling $32.2 million. Although PC net revenue increased in fiscal 2003, PC net revenue declined as a percentage of net revenue as consumers migrated to console gameplay. Xbox Net revenue from sales of Xbox products increased from $78.4 million to $219.4 million, or 4.3 percent of net revenue, in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in the installed base and greater demand for our products .. The installed base increased in fiscal 2003 due to the launch of Xbox in the United States in November 2001 and in Europe in March 2002. In fiscal 2002, there was only a short period (five months in the United States and one month in Europe) during which the consoles were available as compared to twelve months in fiscal 2003. As a result, we were able to release Xbox products during all of fiscal 2003. Nintendo GameCube Net revenue from Nintendo GameCube products increased from $51.7 million to $176.7 million, or 4.1 percent of net revenue, in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. The increase in net revenue for fiscal 2003 was primarily due to growth in the installed base of the Nintendo GameCube, which was available in every 36 Table of Contents major market in which we operated during fiscal 2003. The Nintendo GameCube was launched in Japan in September 2001 and North America in November 2001, but not in Europe until May 2002. Game Boy Advance Net revenue from sales of Game Boy Advance titles increased in fiscal 2003 by 81.2 percent to $79.1 million as compared to $43.7 million in fiscal 2002, primarily due to increased net revenue in the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter franchises and the increased number of Game Boy Advance titles available in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, we released seven titles on the Game Boy Advance platform compared to three in fiscal 2002. PlayStation In fiscal 2003, net revenue from PlayStation products decreased by $89.6 million to $100.0 million as compared to fiscal 2002. The decrease in net revenue was attributable to the market transition to newer generation console systems and our transition away from that platform. Co Publishing and Distribution Net revenue from co publishing products and distribution products increased 39.7 percent to $375.8 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $269.0 million in fiscal 2002 primarily due to strong sales of hit titles including Kingdom Hearts, 1503 A.D. The New World and higher Battlefield 1942 franchise net revenue. Advertising, Programming, Licensing and Other In fiscal 2003, net revenue from advertising, programming, licensing and other products decreased by $42.5 million to $76.4 million as compared to fiscal 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of an expected decline in our Game Boy Color and Nintendo 64 net revenue as we transitioned away from those platforms. In addition, revenue derived from advertising on our online games sites decreased 16 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to $3.8 million in lower advertising revenue generated from AOL and co branded AOL online properties, and a $1.8 million decrease in online advertising purchased by online game companies that link their games sites to ours.

Higher PC margins increased our total gross margin by 1.7 percent. n Higher margins on co publishing and distribution products primarily due to a higher volume of co publishing products, which have a higher gross margin than distribution products, released in fiscal 2003, such as Battlefield 1942, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger and The Simpsons Road Rage. Higher margins on co publishing and distribution products contributed 0.9 percent to our total gross margin. n Higher margins on PlayStation 2 products primarily due to volume discounts received from Sony and overall lower average manufacturing royalty rates, all of which contributed 0.8 percent to our total gross margin. 37 Table of Contents Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 (in thousands): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2003 Revenue 2002 Revenue $ Change % Change $332,453 13.4 % $ 241,109 14.0 % $ 91,344 37.9 % Marketing and sales expenses increased by 37.9 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to: n Higher advertising spending of $46.1 million to support product releases on multiple platforms and across multiple territories including Madden NFLTM 2003, NBA Live 2003, The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, The Sims franchise titles and The Sims Online.

For fiscal 2002, amortization of goodwill totaled $13.1 million. n Certain identifiable intangible assets related to Westwood and DreamWorks were amortized in fiscal 2002, resulting in a decrease of $3.5 million. n Impairment of Pogo and Kesmai finite lived intangible assets as a result of the restructuring of the EA.com segment in fiscal 2003 and 2002, resulting in lower amortization expense of $2.9 million. In addition, we recorded intangible impairment charges relating to our restructuring of the EA.com business segment of $12.4 million in fiscal 2003 and $1.6 million in fiscal 2002. For further information, please see our discussion under Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges below. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges Restructuring and asset impairment charges for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 (in thousands): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2003 Revenue 2002 Revenue % Change Restructuring Charges $ 15,102 0.6 % $ 7,485 0.4 % 101.8 % Asset Impairment Charges $ 66,329 2.7 % $ 12,818 0.8 % 417.5 % For a discussion of our Fiscal 2003 restructurings, please refer to Comparison of Fiscal 2004 to Fiscal 2003 above. Fiscal 2002 Restructuring In October 2001, we announced a restructuring plan for EA.com. The restructuring initiatives involved strategic decisions to discontinue certain product offerings and focus only on key online priorities that aligned with our fiscal 2003 operational objectives. A concurrent workforce reduction resulted in the termination of approximately 270 positions. During fiscal 2002, we recorded restructuring charges of $20.3 million, consisting of $4.2 million for workforce reductions, $3.3 million for consolidation of facilities and other administrative charges, and $12.8 million for the write off of non current assets and facilities. The estimated costs for workforce reduction included severance charges for terminated employees and costs for certain outplacement service contracts. The consolidation of facilities resulted in the closure of EA.coms San Diego studio and consolidation of its San Francisco and Virginia facilities. The estimated costs for consolidation of facilities included contractual rental commitments under real estate leases for unutilized office space offset by estimated future sub lease income, costs to close or consolidate facilities, and costs to write off a portion of the assets from these facilities. Impairment charges on long lived assets amounted to $12.8 million and included $11.2 million relating to abandoned technologies consisting of customized internal use software systems for the EA.com infrastructure, $1.0 million of Kesmai intangibles impairment because associated products and services were discontinued and $0.6 million of goodwill charges relating to EA.coms San Diego studio closure. The remaining portion of Kesmai assets as of March 31, 2002 was $15.9 million, consisting of $13.1 million of goodwill and $2.8 million of intangibles relating to Kesmais developed and core technology and acquired workforce. For further discussion on our restructurings and asset impairment charges, please see Note 6 in our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in item 8 hereof. Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net, for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 (in thousands): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2003 Revenue 2002 Revenue $ Change % Change $5,222 0.2 % $ 12,848 0.7 % $ (7,626 ) (59.4 %) 39 Table of Contents Interest and other income, net, in fiscal 2003 decreased from fiscal 2002 primarily due to an other than temporary impairment of investments in affiliates of $10.6 million in fiscal 2003, partially offset by higher interest income in fiscal 2003 of $5.1 million, as a result of higher average cash balances during the fiscal year. Income Taxes Income taxes for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 (in thousands): March 31, Effective March 31, Effective 2003 Tax Rate 2002 Tax Rate % Change $143,049 31.0 % $ 45,969 31.0 % 211.2 % Our effective tax rate was 31.0 percent for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. Net Income Net income for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 (in thousands): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2003 Revenue 2002 Revenue $ Change % Change $317,097 12.8 % $ 101,509 5.9 % $ 215,588 212.4 % Reported net income increased in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to the reasons discussed above. Although the dollar amount of expenses rose in fiscal 2003 versus fiscal 2002, net income as a percentage of net revenue increased to 12.8 percent versus 5.9 percent as expenses grew at a slower rate than did our net revenue. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities (VIEs) that either (i) do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or (ii) are owned by equity investors who lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest. This interpretation applies immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003. With regard to VIEs already in existence prior to February 1, 2003, the implementation of FIN 46 was delayed and currently applies to the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after December 15, 2003. FIN 46 requires disclosure of VIEs in financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, if it is reasonably possible that as of the transition date (i) we will be the primary beneficiary of an existing VIE that will require consolidation, or (ii) we will hold a significant variable interest in, or have significant involvement with, an existing VIE. We adopted FIN 46 in the quarter ended December 31, 2003; however, it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In January 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached consensus on Issue No. 00 21 (EITF 00 21), Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF 00 21 provides guidance on how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables requires that such deliverables be accounted for separately. EITF 00 21 allows for prospective adoption for arrangements entered into after June 15, 2003 or adoption via a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We adopted EITF 00 21 in the quarter ended June 30, 2003; however, it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force ratified the consensus reached on paragraphs 6 through 23 of Issue No. 03 01 (EITF 03 1), The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. EITF 03 1 requires that certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures should be required for debt and marketable equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity under SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities and SFAS No. 124, 40 Table of Contents Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not for Profit Organizations that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized. We adopted EITF 03 1 in the year ended March 31, 2004; however, it did not have a material impact on the disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2004, the FASB, issued an exposure draft on the Proposed Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, Share Based Payment an amendment of FASB Statements No. 123 and 95. The proposed statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions with employees and other third parties. The proposed standard would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally would require that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method. If the final standard is approved as currently drafted in the exposure draft, it would have a material impact on the amount of earnings we report. Management has not yet determined the impact that the proposed statement will have on our business. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Year Ended March 31, March 31, Increase/ 2004 2003 (Decrease) (In millions) Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments $ 2,414 $ 1,588 $ 826 Marketable equity securities 1 1 $ 2,415 $ 1,589 $ 826 Percentage of total assets 71.0 % 67.3 % Year Ended March 31, March 31, Increase/ 2004 2003 (Decrease) (In millions) Cash provided by operating activities $ 669 $ 714 $ (45 ) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 288 (463 ) 751 Cash provided by financing activities 225 132 93 Effect of foreign exchange on cash and cash equivalents 18 14 4 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,200 $ 397 $ 803 Changes in Cash Flow During the year ended March 31, 2004, we generated $669.3 million of cash from operating activities compared to $714.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2003. This decline was primarily the result of our fourth quarter sales in fiscal 2004 occurring later in the quarter as compared to fiscal 2003, particularly in Europe. We expect to continue to generate similar levels of operating cash flow in fiscal 2005. For the year ended March 31, 2004, our primary use of cash in non operating activities consisted of $89.6 million in capital expenditures, primarily related to the expansions of our Los Angeles and Vancouver studios. These non operating expenditures were offset by net proceeds of $371.8 million in short term investments and $227.8 million in proceeds from the sale of our common stock through stock plans during the year ended March 31, 2004. Receivables, Net Our gross accounts receivable balance was $366.6 million and $246.7 million as of March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2003, respectively. The increase in our accounts receivable balance was primarily due to our fourth quarter sales in fiscal 2004 occurring later in the quarter as compared to fiscal 2003, particularly in Europe. We expect to collect a substantial portion of these amounts in the three months ended June 30, 2004. Reserves for sales returns, pricing allowances and doubtful accounts decreased from $164.6 million as of March 31, 2003 to $154.7 million as of March 31, 2004. Both the sales return and price protection reserves decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of trailing six and nine month net revenue as of March 31, 41 Table of Contents 2004. We believe these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of potential returns and allowances. Inventories Inventories increased to $55.1 million as of March 31, 2004 from $39.7 million as of March 31, 2003 primarily due to overall growth in Europe. We typically have a higher inventory balance, as a percentage of net revenue, on hand in Europe compared to North America, due to the need to provide multiple language versions of each title in that region. No single title represented more than $4.0 million of inventory as of March 31, 2004. Other Current Assets Other current assets increased to $143.9 million as of March 31, 2004 from $83.5 million as of March 31, 2003 primarily due to increases in volume rebates and advertising credits owed to us by our suppliers and VAT receivable, both relating to the growth of our business, offset by lower prepaid royalties as we continue to increase internal title development. Accounts Payable Accounts payable increased to $114.1 million as of March 31, 2004 from $106.3 million as of March 31, 2003 primarily due to the higher sales volume we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. Accrued and Other Liabilities Our accrued and other liabilities increased to $608.2 million as of March 31, 2004 from $464.5 million as of March 31, 2003, as a result of the overall increase in our sales and related operational expenses and profit. The increase was due to increases in income taxes payable, accrued compensation and benefits, accrued development, deferred revenue and VAT payable. We anticipate our accrued and other liabilities balance to decline following our tax and bonus payments during the three months ended June 30, 2004. Financial Condition We believe the existing cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, marketable equity securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments. We may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position, facilitate expansion, pursue strategic investments or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. There can be no guarantee that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all, or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. A portion of our cash is generated from operations domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions (approximately $554.4 million as of March 31, 2004) that is designated as indefinitely reinvested in the respective tax jurisdiction. While we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the United States in the short term, if we were required to do so to fund our operations in the United States, we would accrue and pay additional taxes in connection with their repatriation. On January 8, 2004, we filed an amended registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This registration statement, including the base prospectus contained therein, became effective on January 15, 2004 and uses a shelf registration process. This shelf registration statement allows us, at any time, to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings up to a total amount of $2.0 billion. Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus, we will use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including for working capital, financing capital expenditures, research and development, marketing and distribution efforts and, if opportunities arise, for acquisitions or strategic alliances. Pending such uses, we may invest the net proceeds in interest bearing securities. In addition, we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time. Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those related to customer demand and acceptance of our titles on new platforms and new 42 Table of Contents versions of our titles on existing platforms, our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due, successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives, the impact of competition, the economic conditions in the domestic and international markets, seasonality in operating results, risks of product returns and the other risks described in the Risk Factors section below. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Letters of Credit In July 2002, we provided an irrevocable standby letter of credit to Nintendo of Europe. The standby letter of credit guarantees performance of our obligations to pay Nintendo of Europe for trade payables of up to 8.0 million Euros. The standby letter of credit expires in July 2005. As of March 31, 2004, we had 0.2 million Euros payable to Nintendo of Europe covered by this standby letter of credit. In August 2003, we provided an irrevocable standby letter of credit to 300 California Associates II, LLC in replacement of our security deposit for office space. The standby letter of credit guarantees performance of our obligations to pay our lease commitment up to $1.1 million. The standby letter of credit expires in December 2006. As of March 31, 2004, we did not have a payable balance on this standby letter of credit. Development, Celebrity, League and Content Licenses: Payments and Commitments The products produced by our studios are designed and created by our employee designers, artists, software programmers and by non employee software developers (independent artists or third party developers). We typically advance development funds to the independent artists and third party developers during development of our games, usually in installment payments made upon the completion of specified development milestones. These payments are considered advances against subsequent royalties based on the sales of the products. These terms are set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists and third party developers. In addition, we have certain celebrity, league and content license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments that are not dependent on any deliverables. Celebrities and organizations with whom we have contracts include: FIFA and UEFA (professional soccer); NASCAR (stock car racing); John Madden (professional football); National Basketball Association (professional basketball); PGA TOUR (professional golf); Tiger Woods (professional golf); National Hockey League and NHLPA (professional hockey); Warner Bros. (Harry Potter, Catwoman and Superman); MGM/ Danjaq (James Bond); New Line Productions (The Lord of the Rings); National Football League and Players Inc. (professional football); Collegiate Licensing Company (collegiate football and basketball); ISC (stock car racing); Major League Baseball Properties; MLB Players Association (professional baseball) and Island Def Jam (fighting). These developer and content license commitments represent the sum of (i) the cash payments due under non royalty bearing licenses and services agreements, and (ii) the minimum payments and advances against royalties due under royalty bearing licenses and services agreements. These minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments are included in the following table. 43 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of March 31, 2004, and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands): Commercial Contractual Obligations Commitments Fiscal Year Developer/ Bank and Letters Ended Licensee Other of March 31, Leases(1) Commitments Marketing Guarantees Credit Total 2005 $ 20,234 $ 42,691 $ 24,744 $ 2,234 $ 305 $ 90,208 2006 23,041 36,962 7,167 234 67,404 2007 17,254 12,789 4,152 204 34,399 2008 14,132 16,003 4,152 204 34,491 2009 9,816 10,503 4,152 203 24,674 Thereafter 35,758 11,307 203 47,268 Total $ 120,235 $ 130,255 $ 44,367 $ 3,282 $ 305 $ 298,444 (1) See discussion on operating leases in the Off Balance Sheet Commitments section herein and Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 hereof, for additional information. The lease commitments disclosed above exclude commitments included in our restructuring activities for contractual rental commitments of $31.3 million under real estate leases for unutilized office space, offset by $18.4 million of estimated future sub lease income. These amounts were expensed in the periods of the related restructuring and are included in our accrued liabilities reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2004. Please see Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 hereof, for additional information. Transactions with Related Parties Transactions with Executive Officers On June 24, 2002, we agreed to loan Warren Jenson $4,000,000, to be forgiven over four years based on his continuing employment. Two million dollars of the note will be forgiven after two years employment (at which time we will provide Mr. Jenson the funds required to offset the tax implications of the forgiveness), and the remainder forgiven after four years. No additional funds will be provided to offset the tax implications of the forgiveness of the second two million dollars. The loan does not bear interest. The entire balance of the loan was outstanding as of June 1, 2004. In April 2002, we agreed to pay certain taxes incurred by Bruce McMillan, Executive Vice President, Group Studio General Manager, Worldwide Studios, arising from his temporary employment with us in the United Kingdom. Mr. McMillan agreed to reimburse us for those payments upon receipt of his corresponding tax refund from the Canadian taxing authorities. We subsequently paid approximately $168,704 and $32,931 in October 2002 and April 2003, respectively, to the UK Inland Revenue for taxes incurred by Mr. McMillan. In May 2003, Mr. McMillan became an executive officer of Electronic Arts. As of January 22, 2004, Mr. McMillan had repaid us the entire amount of the tax payments we made on his behalf. OFF BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS Lease Commitments We lease certain of our current facilities and certain equipment under non cancelable operating lease agreements. We are required to pay property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs for certain of our facilities and will be required to pay any increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder of our facilities. In February 1995, we entered into a build to suit lease with a third party for our headquarters facility in Redwood City, California, which was refinanced with Keybank National Association in July 2001 and expires in July 2006. We accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, 44 Table of Contents Accounting for Leases, as amended. Existing campus facilities developed in phase one comprise a total of 350,000 square feet and provide space for sales, marketing, administration and research and development functions. We have an option to purchase the property (land and facilities) for a maximum of $145.0 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for (i) an extension of the lease or (ii) sale of the property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up to $128.9 million if the sales price is less than this amount, subject to certain provisions of the lease. In December 2000, we entered into a second build to suit lease with Keybank National Association for a five year term beginning December 2000 to expand our Redwood City, California headquarters facilities and develop adjacent property adding approximately 310,000 square feet to our campus. Construction was completed in June 2002. We accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, as amended. The facilities provide space for marketing, sales and research and development. We have an option to purchase the property for a maximum of $130.0 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for (i) an extension of the lease, or (ii) sale of the property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up to $118.8 million if the sales price is less than this amount, subject to certain provisions of the lease. We believe the estimated fair values of both properties under these operating leases are in excess of their respective guaranteed residual values as of March 31, 2004. For the two lease agreements with Keybank National Association, as described above, the lease rates are based upon the Commercial Paper Rate and require us to maintain certain financial covenants as shown below, all of which we were in compliance with as of March 31, 2004. Actual as of Financial Covenants Requirement March 31, 2004 Consolidated Net Worth $ 1,684 million $ 2,678 million Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio 3.00 31.15 Total Consolidated Debt to Capital 60 % 8.5 % Quick Ratio Q1 & Q2 1.00 N/A Q3 & Q4 1.75 10.55 In July 2003, we entered into a lease agreement with an independent third party (the Landlord) for a studio facility in Los Angeles, California, which commenced in October 2003 and expires in September 2013 with two five year options to extend the lease term. Additionally, we have options to purchase the property after five and ten years based on the fair market value of the property at the date of sale, a right of first offer to purchase the property upon terms offered by the landlord, and a right to share in the profits from a sale of the property. We have accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, as amended. Existing campus facilities comprise a total of 243,000 square feet and provide space for research and development functions. Our rental obligation under this agreement is $50.2 million over the initial ten year term of the lease. We are taking possession of the property over a period of 18 months as the facilities become available for use. This commitment is offset by sublease income of $5.8 million for the sublet to an affiliate of the Landlord of 18,000 square feet of the Los Angeles facility, which commenced in October 2003 and expires in September 2013 with options of early termination by the affiliate after five years and by EA after four and five years. INFLATION We believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant for each of the past three fiscal years. 45 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS Our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance. If any of the events or circumstances described below occurs, our business and financial performance could be harmed, our actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and the market value of our securities could decline. The success of our business is highly dependent on being able to predict which new videogame platforms will be successful, and on the market acceptance and timely release of those platforms. We derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on videogame platforms manufactured by third parties, such as Sonys PlayStation 2. Therefore, the success of our products is driven in large part by the success of new videogame hardware systems and our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful in the marketplace. We must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform. A new platform for which we are developing products may be delayed, may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated. If the platforms for which we are developing products are not released when anticipated or do not attain wide market acceptance, our revenue growth will suffer, we may be unable to fully recover the resources we have committed, and our financial performance will be harmed. Our platform licensors set the royalty rates and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their platforms, and therefore have significant influence on our costs. If one or more of the platform licensors adopt a different fee structure for future game consoles or we are unable to obtain such licenses, our profitability will be materially impacted. In the next few years, we expect our platform licensors to introduce new game machines into the market. In order to publish products for a new game machine, we must take a license from the platform licensor which gives the platform licensor the opportunity to set the fee structure that we must pay in order to publish games for that platform. Similarly, the platform licensors have retained the flexibility to change their fee structures for online gameplay and features for their consoles. The control that platform licensors have over the fee structures for their future platforms and online access makes it difficult for us to predict our costs and profitability in the medium to long term. It is also possible that platform licensors will not renew our licenses. Because publishing products for videogame consoles is the largest portion of our business, any increase in fee structures or failure to secure a license relationship would have a significant negative impact on our business model and profitability. Our business is both seasonal and cyclical. If we fail to deliver our products at the right times, our sales will suffer. Our business is highly seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand, and a significant percentage of our revenue, occurring in the December quarter. If we miss this key selling period, due to product delays or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products, our sales will suffer disproportionately. Our industry is also cyclical. Videogame platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years. As one group of platforms is reaching the end of its cycle and new platforms are emerging, consumers often defer game software purchases until the new platforms are available, causing sales to decline. This decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new platform. For example, following the launch of Sonys PlayStation2 platform, we experienced a significant decline in revenue from sales of products for Sonys older PlayStation game console, which was not immediately offset by revenue generated from sales of products for the PlayStation2 platform. 46 Table of Contents Our business is intensely competitive and increasingly hit driven. If we do not continue to deliver hit products, our success will be limited. Competition in our industry is intense, and new products are regularly introduced. A relatively small number of hit titles accounts for a significant portion of total sales. For example, during calendar year 2003, approximately 19 percent of the sales of videogames in North America consisted of only 20 hit products. If our competitors develop more successful products, or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality products, our revenue and profitability will decline. If we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to intellectual property, we will publish fewer hit titles and our revenue, profitability and cash flows will decline. Competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs. Many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others. For example, our EA SPORTS products include rights licensed from the major sports leagues and players associations. Similarly, many of our hit EA GAMES franchises, such as Bond, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, are based on key film and literary licenses. Competition for these licenses is intense. If we are unable to maintain these licenses and obtain additional licenses with significant commercial value, our revenues and profitability will decline significantly. Competition for these licenses may also drive up the advances, guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor, which could significantly increase our costs. If patent claims continue to be asserted against us, we may be unable to sustain our current business models or profits. Many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used game technologies. Additionally, infringement claims under many recently issued patents are now being asserted against Internet implementations of existing games. Several such claims have been asserted against us. Such claims can harm our business. We incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims, regardless of the merits of the claims. In the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a third party patent, we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future. Other intellectual property claims may increase our product costs or require us to cease selling affected products. Many of our products include extremely realistic graphical images, and we expect that as technology continues to advance, images will become even more realistic. Some of the images and other content are based on real world examples that may inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others, it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement. From time to time, we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims. Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid or not, may be time consuming and expensive to defend. Such claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the affected products, redesign those products to avoid infringement, or obtain a license, all of which would be costly and harm our business. Our business, our products and our distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories of content, consumer privacy and online delivery. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our business may suffer. Legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution. For example, privacy laws in the United States and Europe impose various restrictions on our web sites. Those rules vary by territory although the Internet recognizes no geographical boundaries. Other countries, such as Germany, have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged goods and those transmitted over the Internet that are stricter than current United States laws. In the United States, the federal and several state governments are considering content restrictions on products such as ours, as well as restrictions on distribution of such products. Any one or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers and by requiring additional differentiation between 47 Table of Contents products for different territories to address varying regulations. This additional product differentiation would be costly. If we do not consistently meet our product development schedules, we will experience fluctuations in our operating results. Our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors, including the creative processes involved, the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams required by the increasing complexity of our products, and the need to refine and tune our products prior to their release. We have in the past experienced development delays for several of our products. Failure to meet anticipated production or go live schedules may cause a shortfall in our revenue and profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different from expectations. Delays that prevent release of our products during peak selling seasons or in conjunction with specific events, such as the release of a related movie or the beginning of a sports season or major sporting event, could adversely affect our financial performance. Technology changes rapidly in our business, and if we fail to anticipate new technologies, the quality, timeliness and competitiveness of our products will suffer. Rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies our products must take advantage of in order to make them competitive in the market at the time they are released. Therefore, we usually start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve. We may not be able to achieve these goals, or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we can. In either case, our products may be technologically inferior to competitive products, or less appealing to consumers, or both. If we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products, then we may delay products until these technology goals can be achieved, which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses. Alternatively, we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies, either to preserve our product launch schedule or to keep up with our competition, which would increase our development expenses. If we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel, we will be unable to effectively conduct our business. The market for technical, creative, marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive. Our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent. If we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need, or replace key employees following their departure, our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired. Our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of and or access to our videogame products. If they do not approve our products, we will be unable to ship to our customers. Our agreements with hardware licensors (such as Sony for the PlayStation 2, Microsoft for the Xbox and Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube) typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products, which could, in certain circumstances, leave us unable to get our products approved, manufactured and shipped to customers. These hardware licensors are also our chief competitors. In most events, control of the approval and manufacturing process by the platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently. While we believe that our relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good, the potential for these licensors to delay or refuse to approve or manufacture our products exists. Such occurrences would harm our business and our financial performance. 48 Table of Contents We compete directly with Microsoft and Sony for sales of products with online capabilities. We also require compatibility code and the consent of each in order to include online capabilities in our products for their respective platforms. As online capabilities for videogame platforms become more significant, Microsoft and Sony could restrict our ability to provide online capabilities for our console platform products. If Microsoft or Sony refused to approve our products with online capabilities or significantly impacted the financial terms on which these services are offered to our customers, our business could be harmed. Our international net revenue is subject to currency fluctuations. For the year ended March 31, 2004, international net revenue comprised 45 percent of total net revenue. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, international net revenue comprised 42 percent of total consolidated net revenue. We expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and growing portion of our revenue. Such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers. Additionally, foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies, which may fluctuate against the dollar. While we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities (primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables), and foreign currency option contracts to hedge some foreign currency forecasted transactions (primarily related to revenue generated by our operational subsidiaries), our results of operations and financial condition may, nonetheless, be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations. Our reported financial results could be affected if significant changes in current accounting principles are adopted. Recent actions and public comments from the SEC have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally. Similarly, Congress has considered a variety of bills that could affect certain accounting principles. The FASB and other regulatory accounting agencies have recently introduced several new or proposed accounting standards, such as accounting for stock options, some of which represent a significant change from current practices. For example, changes in our accounting for stock options could materially increase our reported expenses. Our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly. As a result of the factors discussed in this report, general economic conditions, and other factors that may arise in the future, the market price of our common stock historically has been, and we expect will continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations. These fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us, to changes in analysts earnings estimates, to factors affecting the computer, software, Internet, entertainment, media or electronics businesses, or to national and international economic conditions. The majority of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key customers. If these customers reduce their purchases of our products or become unable to pay for them, our business could be harmed. In the U.S. in fiscal 2004, over 70 percent of our sales were made to six key customers. In Europe, our top ten customers accounted for over 35 percent of our sales in that territory in fiscal 2004. Worldwide, we had direct sales to one customer, Wal Mart Stores, Inc., which represented 13 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2004. Though our products are available to consumers through a variety of retailers, the concentration of our sales in one, or a few, large customers could lead to short term disruption in our sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products, and could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products. Additionally, our receivables from these large customers increase significantly in the December quarter as they stock up for the holiday selling season. Also, having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers reduces our negotiating leverage with these customers. 49 Table of Contents Acquisitions, investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties, dilution to our investors and other negative consequences. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including (1) acquisitions of companies, businesses, intellectual properties, and other assets, and (2) investments in new interactive entertainment businesses (for example, online and mobile games). Any of these strategic transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. Although we regularly search for opportunities to engage in strategic transactions, we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities. We may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or investments or an acquisition or investment may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired company or business, or successfully exploiting acquired intellectual property or other assets, could divert a significant amount of our managements time and focus and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Additional risks we face include: n The need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls, procedures and policies, n Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization, n Retaining employees from the businesses we acquire, n The need to integrate an acquired companys accounting, management information, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and n To the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside of the United States, we face additional risks, including risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. Future acquisitions and investments could involve the issuance of our equity securities, potentially diluting our existing stockholders, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review, vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments. We have begun the implementation of a common set of financial information systems throughout our worldwide organization, which, if not completed in a successful and timely manner, could impede our ability to accurately process, prepare and analyze important financial data. As part of our effort to improve efficiencies throughout our worldwide organization, we have begun the implementation of a common set of practices, processes and financial information systems. The successful conversion from our current financial information systems to new financial information systems entails a number of risks due to the complexity of the conversion and implementation process. Such risks include verifying the accuracy of the business data and information prior to conversion, the actual conversion of that data and information to the new systems and then using that business data and information in the new systems after the conversion. In addition, because the implementation is company wide, there is a need for substantial and comprehensive company wide employee training. While testing of these new systems and processes and training of employees are done in advance of implementation, there are inherent limitations in our ability to simulate a full scale operating environment in advance of implementation. Finally, there can be no assurance that the conversion to, and the implementation of, the new financial information systems will not impede our ability to accurately and timely process, prepare and analyze the financial data we use in making operating decisions and which form the basis of the financial information we include in the periodic reports we file with the SEC. 50 Table of Contents Our products are subject to the threat of piracy by a variety of organizations and individuals. If we are not successful in combating and preventing piracy, our sales and profitability could be harmed significantly. In many countries around the world, more pirated copies of our products are sold than legitimate copies. Though piracy has not had a material impact on our operating results to date, highly organized pirate operations have been expanding globally. In addition, the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures we use in our products, the availability of broadband access to the Internet, the ability to download pirated copies of our games from various Internet sites, and the widespread proliferation of Internet cafes using pirated copies of our products, all have contributed to ongoing and expanding piracy. Though we take steps to make the unauthorized copying and distribution of our products more difficult, as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our games are played, neither our efforts nor those of the console manufacturers may be successful in controlling the piracy of our products. This could have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and prices. Foreign exchange forward and option contracts used to either mitigate or hedge foreign currency exposures and short term investments are subject to market risk. We do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables. Our foreign exchange forward contracts are accounted for as derivatives whereby the gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses on open contracts at the end of each accounting period resulting from changes in the forward rate are recognized in earnings and are designed to offset gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. As of March 31, 2004, we had foreign exchange forward contracts, all with maturities of less than one month, to sell approximately $189.6 million in foreign currencies, consisting primarily of British Pounds, Euros, Japanese Yen and other currencies. Of this amount, $172.3 million represents contracts to sell foreign currency in exchange for U.S. dollars and $17.3 million represents contracts to sell foreign currency in exchange for British Pounds. From time to time, we hedge some of our foreign currency risk related to anticipated future sales transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have maturities of 15 months or less. If qualified, these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. For the year ended March 31, 2004, we recognized a loss of $1.6 million in earnings associated with the time value of these option contracts. The counterparties to these forward and options contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks. The risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material. Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks, there can be no assurances that our mitigating activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. 51 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward and option contracts as of March 31, 2004. The information is provided in U.S. dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount (forward or option amount), the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value. The fair value of our forward and option contracts is recorded in other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Weighted Notional Average Amount Contract Rate Fair Value (In thousands, except contract rates) Foreign currency to be sold under contract: British Pound $ 84,222 1.8490 $ 967 Euro 48,002 1.2308 96 Japanese Yen 14,730 0.0094 23 Swedish Krona 12,022 0.1336 255 Danish Krone 8,092 0.1651 95 Australian Dollar 7,506 0.7506 43 Norwegian Krone 5,848 0.1462 89 Swiss Franc 4,773 0.7956 41 South African Rand 4,392 0.1514 59 Total $ 189,587 $ 1,668 Foreign currency to be purchased under contract: British Pound $ 17,274 1.8319 $ (19 ) Option contracts purchased Euro $ 84,868 1.1316 $ 1,257 52 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities. Though we maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity, currently, the majority of our investments are callable by the issuer. As there can be no assurance as to how long these investments will be held, we classify these securities as short term investments based on call date. As of March 31, 2004, our cash equivalents and short term investments included $2.3 billion of debt securities, consisting primarily of U.S. agency bonds, money market funds and municipal securities. Notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks, there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. The table below presents the amounts (in thousands) and related weighted average interest rates of our investment portfolio as of March 31, 2004: Weighted Average Interest Rate Cost Fair Value Cash equivalents(1) Fixed rate 1.59 % $ 698,479 $ 699,076 Variable rate 1.41 % 1,292,186 1,292,204 Short term investments(1)(2) Fixed rate 1.69 % 214,972 214,483 Variable rate 1.42 % 50,000 49,978 $ 2,255,637 $ 2,255,741 (1) See definition in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 hereof.
