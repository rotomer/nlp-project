Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation OVERVIEW The following overview is a top level discussion of our operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business. Management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for fiscal 2005, as well as our future prospects. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Form 10 K, including in Business, the remainder of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Risk Factors or the consolidated financial statements and related notes. About Electronic Arts We develop, market, publish and distribute interactive software games that are playable by consumers on home video game consoles (such as the Sony PlayStation 2, Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo GameCube consoles), personal computers, mobile platforms including hand held game players (such as the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS and Sony PSP) and cellular handsets and online, over the Internet and other proprietary online networks. Some of our games are based on content that we license from others (e.g., Madden NFL Football, Harry Potter and FIFA Soccer), and some of our games are based on our own wholly owned intellectual property (e.g., The Sims and Need for Speed). Our goal is to develop titles which appeal to the mass markets, which often means translating and localizing them for sale in non English speaking countries. In addition, we also attempt to create software game franchises that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property. Examples of this are the annual iterations of our sports based franchises (e.g., NCAA Football and FIFA Soccer), titles based on long lived movie properties (e.g., James Bond and Harry Potter) and wholly owned properties that can be successfully sequeled (e.g., The Sims and Need for Speed). Overview of Financial Results Total net revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 was $3.129 billion, up 5.8 percent, as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. Six franchises sold more than five million units in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005: The Sims, Need for Speed, Madden, FIFA, The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. We published three titles each on the Nintendo DS and the Sony PSP, two new platforms released during the year ended March 31, 2005. Net revenue on these platforms increased our net revenue by approximately $41 million and we expect to continue to develop titles for both platforms in fiscal 2006. Net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 was $504 million, a 12.7 percent decrease as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 and diluted earnings per share were $1.59 as compared with $1.87 for the prior year. We generated $634 million in cash from operations during the year ended March 31, 2005 as compared to $669 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. The decrease in cash flow was primarily the result of (1) our overall decline in net income for fiscal 2005, (2) higher accounts receivable balances due to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and (3) higher cash payments for income taxes. These declines were partially offset by higher balances in our current liabilities. Managements Overview of Historical and Prospective Business Trends Transition to Next Generation Consoles. Our industry is cyclical and we believe it has entered into a transition stage heading into the next cycle. Over the course of the next eighteen months, we expect Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo to introduce new video game consoles into the market. During this transition, we intend to continue developing new titles for the current generation of video game consoles while we also make significant investments as we prepare to introduce products that operate on the next generation consoles. We have and expect to continue to incur higher costs during this transition to next generation consoles. We also expect development costs for next generation video games to be greater on a per title basis than development costs for current generation video games. In addition, sales of video games for current generation consoles may begin to decline and consumers may defer game software purchases until the next generation consoles become 21 Table of Contents available. While we expect our sales and gross profit to increase in fiscal 2006, such increases may not offset the increased costs we have and expect to continue to incur during the transition. As we move through the transition, we expect our operating results to be more volatile and difficult to predict, which could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly. Increasing Cost of Titles. Titles have become increasingly expensive to produce and market as the platforms on which they are played continue to advance technologically and consumers demand continual improvements in the overall gameplay experience. We expect this trend to continue throughout the transition from current generation to next generation platforms as (1) we require larger production teams to create our titles, (2) the technology needed to develop titles becomes more complex, (3) the number and nature of the platforms for which we develop titles increases and becomes more diverse, (4) the cost of licensing the third party intellectual property we use in many of our titles increases, and (5) we develop new methods to distribute our content via the Internet and on hand held and wireless devices. Software Prices. As current generation console prices continue to decrease, we expect more value oriented consumers to purchase consoles and software. We experienced this trend several years ago when prices were reduced on previous generation consoles (e.g., Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64). As a result of a more value oriented consumer base, and a greater number of software titles being published, we expect average software prices to continue to decline on current generation consoles, which may have a negative impact on our gross margin but not necessarily our gross profit. Sales of Hit Titles. Sales of hit titles, several of which were top sellers across a number of international markets, continued to contribute to our revenue growth. Our top five selling titles across all platforms worldwide during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 were Need for Speed Underground 2, Madden NFL 2005, FIFA Soccer 2005, The Sims 2 and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Hit titles are important to our financial performance because they benefit from overall economies of scale. We have developed, and it is our objective to continue to develop, many of our hit titles to become franchise titles that can be regularly iterated. Increased Console Installed Base. As consumers purchase the current generation of consoles, either as a first time buyer or by upgrading from a previous generation, the console installed base increases. As the installed base for a particular console increases, we generally are able to increase our unit volume; however, these unit volumes often begin to decrease as consumers anticipate the release of the next generation of consoles. In March 2004, Microsoft reduced the retail price of its Xbox console in the U.S. and in May 2004 Sony did the same with its PlayStation 2 console. In August 2004, both companies also reduced their console retail prices in Europe. Although these price reductions drove an increase in console sales in the United States and Europe, hardware shortages during the holiday season limited the growth of the installed base in fiscal 2005. Nonetheless, we believe the significant increase in the installed base for current generation consoles was a contributing factor to our total net revenue growth during fiscal 2005. Provided that the console manufacturers are able to deliver an adequate supply of consoles, we expect the installed base of current generation consoles to increase during fiscal 2006 and unit sales of current generation titles to remain strong. International Operations and Sales Growth. In fiscal 2005, net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately 47 percent of our total net revenue, up from 46 percent during fiscal 2004. Our increase in international net revenue was primarily driven by sales in Europe and Asia Pacific, including the benefit of foreign exchange. We anticipate that international net revenue will continue to increase during fiscal 2006 as the console installed base continues to expand outside of North America. In particular, we believe that in order to succeed in China and Japan, it is important to develop content locally. As such, we expect to devote resources to hire local development talent and expand our infrastructure in each country, most notably, the expansion and creation of local studio facilities. In addition, we anticipate establishing online game marketing, publishing and distribution functions in China. As part of this strategy, we may seek to partner with established local companies through acquisitions, joint ventures or other similar arrangements. Foreign Exchange Impact. Given that a significant portion of our business is conducted internationally in foreign currency, fluctuations in currency prices can have a material impact on our results of operations. For example, the average exchange rate for the Euro, as compared to the U.S. dollar, increased from $1.17 per Euro during the twelve months ended March 31, 2004 to $1.25 per Euro during the twelve months ended March 31, 2005. As a result of the fluctuations in currency prices, we had a total foreign exchange benefit on 22 Table of Contents net revenue of approximately $95 million during the twelve months ended March 31, 2005. Although we intend to continue to utilize foreign exchange forward and option contracts to either mitigate or hedge against some foreign currency exposures, we cannot predict the effect foreign currency fluctuations will have on us during fiscal 2006. Expansion of Studio Resources and Technology. In fiscal 2005, we devoted significant resources to the overall expansion of our studio facilities in North America and Europe. We expect to continue to make significant investments in our studio facilities in North America in fiscal 2006. As we move through the life cycle of current generation consoles, we will continue to devote significant resources to the development of current generation titles while at the same time we continue to invest heavily in tools and technologies for the next generation of platforms and technology. Leader in Interactive Sports Entertainment. We are a leading developer and publisher of interactive sports entertainment. We generate a significant portion of our revenue from sports related product franchises such as FIFA Soccer, Madden NFL Football, NCAA Football, Tiger Woods Golf, NASCAR, NBA Basketball, and NCAA Basketball. We recently have taken a number of steps to enhance our products in the interactive sports category by entering into exclusive license agreements with ESPN, the NFL, PLAYERS, Inc. (the NFL players association), Collegiate Licensing Company (NCAA football), and the Arena Football League. In addition, we have long standing, exclusive relationships with various sports organizations and celebrities, including FIFA (the worldwide soccer governing body and sponsor of the soccer World Cup), UEFA (the European soccer governing body and sponsor of the soccer Euro Cup), NASCAR, Tiger Woods and the PGA TOUR, and, in the future, we may enter into other exclusive relationships with other sports partners. While we expect to generate increased revenue as a result of these agreements, it may not be enough to offset the impact of the associated costs on our gross profit, which could negatively affect our gross margin on these products. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown. As a result, actual results may differ materially from our estimates. Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns, Allowances and Bad Debt Reserves We principally derive revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles (such as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube), PCs and mobile platforms including hand held game players (such as the Nintendo Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS and Sony PSP) and cellular handsets. We evaluate the recognition of revenue based on the criteria set forth in Statement of Position (SOP) 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98 9, Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions and Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as revised by SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition. We evaluate revenue recognition using the following basic criteria and recognize revenue when all four criteria are met: Evidence of an arrangement: We recognize revenue when we have evidence of an agreement with the customer reflecting the terms and conditions to deliver products. Delivery: Delivery is considered to occur when the products are shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer. For online games and services, revenue is recognized as the service is provided. Fixed or determinable fee: If a portion of the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, we recognize that amount as revenue when the amount becomes fixed or determinable. 23 Table of Contents Collection is deemed probable: At the time of the transaction, we conduct a credit review of each customer involved in a significant transaction to determine the creditworthiness of the customer. Collection is deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due. If we determine that collection is not probable, we recognize revenue when collection becomes probable (generally upon cash collection). Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements, we must make assumptions and judgments in order to: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE) exists for each undelivered element; and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver. Changes to any of these assumptions or judgments, or changes to the elements in a software arrangement, could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors (channel partners), is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce product revenue for estimated future returns, price protection, and other offerings, which may occur with our customers and channel partners. In certain countries, we have stock balancing programs for our PC products, which allow for the exchange of PC products by resellers under certain circumstances. It is our general practice to exchange products or give credits, rather than give cash refunds. In certain countries, from time to time, we decide to provide price protection for both our PC and video game system products. In our decision, we analyze historical returns, current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products, current trends in the video game market and the overall economy, changes in consumer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and price protection allowances. In addition, we monitor the volume of our sales to our channel partners and their inventories, as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods. While historically actual returns and price protection have not generally exceeded our reserves, as we have previously publicly stated, in the quarter ended March 31, 2005 we incurred higher actual returns and price protection than we had anticipated. We have reviewed current sell through information through the date of this filing and do not intend to accept sales returns or provide price protection on unsold product in our distribution channels existing as of March 31, 2005 in amounts in excess of our March 31, 2005 allowances. In the future, actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. For example, the risk of product returns and or price protection for our products may increase as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube consoles move through their lifecycles and an increasing number and aggregate amount of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures. While management believes it can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates changed, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report. For example, if actual returns and or price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established, our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue. Conversely, if actual returns and or price protection were significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our reported total net revenue. Significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period. We determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends. Depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers, the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly. Royalties and Licenses Our royalty expenses consist of payments to (1) content licensors, (2) independent software developers, and (3) co publishing and or distribution affiliates. License royalties consist of payments made to celebrities, 24 Table of Contents professional sports organizations, movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademark, copyright, personal publicity rights, content and or other intellectual property. Royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games. Co publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for delivery of product. Royalty based payments made to content licensors and distribution affiliates generally are capitalized as prepaid royalties and expensed to cost of goods sold at the greater of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales. Prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and co publishing affiliates are generally in connection with the development of a particular product and, therefore, we are generally subject to development risk prior to the general release of the product. Accordingly, payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed as research and development as the services are incurred. Payments due after completion of the product (primarily royalty based in nature) are generally expensed as cost of goods sold at the higher of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales. Minimum guaranteed royalty obligations are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no significant performance remains with the licensor. When significant performance remains with the licensor, we record royalty payments as an asset when actually paid rather than upon execution of the contract. Minimum royalty payment obligations are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next twelve months. As of March 31, 2005 and March 31, 2004, approximately $51 million and $63 million, respectively, of minimum guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized. Each quarter, we also evaluate the future realization of our royalty based assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales. Any impairments determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense. Impairments determined post launch are charged to cost of goods sold. In either case, we rely on estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties. If actual sales or revised revenue estimates fall below the initial revenue estimate, then the actual charge taken may be greater in any given quarter than anticipated. As of March 31, 2005, we had $135 million of royalty related assets and $1,483 million of unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid that could be impaired if our revenue estimates change. Valuation of Long Lived Assets We evaluate both purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets in order to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in value exists. This evaluation requires us to estimate, among other things, the remaining useful lives of the assets and future cash flows of the business. These evaluations and estimates require the use of judgment. Our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates. Under current accounting standards, we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. In order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred, management makes various assumptions about the future value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows. Our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play on proprietary video game consoles, hand held game players and PCs (collectively referred to as platforms). The success of our products is affected by our ability to accurately predict which platforms and which products we develop will be successful. Also, our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules. Due to product sales shortfalls, we may not realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our long lived assets, which may result in an impairment charge being recorded in the future. We did not record any asset impairment charges in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2004 and 2003, we recognized less than $1 million and $66 million, respectively, of asset impairment charges. 25 Table of Contents Income Taxes In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods. This process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction where we operate. These estimates involve complex issues, require extended periods of time to resolve, and require us to make judgments, such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities. We are also required to make determinations of the need to record deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is established to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction. In addition, changes in our business, such as acquisitions, changes in our international structure, changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in the geographic mix of income, as well as changes in, or termination of, our agreements with tax authorities, valuation allowances, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other matters, and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate for future fiscal years. For example, in the three months ended March 31, 2004, we resolved certain tax related matters with the Internal Revenue Service, which lowered our income tax expense by approximately $20 million and resulted in a 2.5 percent rate reduction for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. By contrast, adverse developments in audits or applicable law result in increases in our tax expense. Similarly, we could experience an increase in our tax expense if we take advantage of a new election that we are entitled to make under the U.S. income tax rules regarding the allocation between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions of tax deductions attributable to employee stock option compensation. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our fiscal year is reported on a 52/53 week period that, historically, has ended on the final Saturday of March in each year. The results of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 each contain 52 weeks and ended on March 26, 2005, March 27, 2004 and March 29, 2003, respectively. For simplicity of presentation, all fiscal periods are treated as ending on a calendar month end. Beginning with the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, we will end our fiscal year on the Saturday nearest March 31. As a result, our fiscal 2006 will be reported as a 53 week year with the first quarter containing 14 weeks. Although certain amounts presented have been rounded to the nearest million, corresponding percentage changes have been calculated on the basis of amounts rounded to the nearest thousand. Comparison of Fiscal 2005 to Fiscal 2004 Net Revenue We principally derive net revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles (such as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube), PCs and mobile platforms which include hand held game players (such as the Nintendo Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS and Sony PSP) and cellular handsets. Additionally, in Europe and Asia Pacific, we generate a significant portion of net revenue by marketing and selling third party interactive software games through our established distribution network. We also derive net revenue from selling subscriptions to some of our online games, programming third party web sites with our game content, allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products, and selling advertisements on our online web pages. 26 Table of Contents From a geographical perspective, our total net revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 was as follows (in millions): Year Ended March 31, % 2005 2004 Increase Change North America $ 1,665 53.2 % $ 1,610 54.4 % $ 55 3.4 % Europe 1,284 41.0 % 1,180 39.9 % 104 8.8 % Asia Pacific 180 5.8 % 167 5.7 % 13 7.6 % International 1,464 46.8 % 1,347 45.6 % 117 8.6 % Total Net Revenue $ 3,129 100.0 % $ 2,957 100.0 % $ 172 5.8 % North America For fiscal 2005, net revenue in North America increased by 3.4 percent as compared to fiscal 2004. From a franchise perspective, the net revenue increase was primarily due to higher sales of products in our Need for Speed franchise. The net revenue increase was also driven by sales of titles in our Fight Night and Burnout franchises, neither of which had corresponding titles released in the prior fiscal year. Together, these items resulted in a net revenue increase of $180 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. This increase was partially offset by lower sales of products in our Medal of Honor, SSX and Lord of the Rings franchises, which reduced net revenue by $135 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. As part of this overall increase in net revenue, we benefited from the launch of the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP in November 2004 and March 2005, respectively. Europe For fiscal 2005, net revenue in Europe increased by 8.8 percent as compared to fiscal 2004. We estimate foreign exchange rates (primarily the Euro and the British pound sterling) strengthened reported European net revenue by approximately $86 million, or 7 percent, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates, we estimate that European net revenue increased by approximately $18 million, or 2 percent, for the year ended March 31, 2005. From a franchise perspective, the net revenue increase was primarily due to (1) higher sales of products in our Need for Speed and The Sims franchises, (2) sales of products in our Burnout franchise which did not have a corresponding title release in the prior fiscal year and (3) sales of UEFA Euro 2004, which was released during the three months ended June 30, 2004 in conjunction with the UEFA Euro 2004 football tournament held in Europe. Together, these items resulted in a net revenue increase of $241 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. This increase was partially offset by lower sales of products in our Medal of Honor, Final Fantasy, SSX and Lord of the Rings franchises, which reduced net revenue by $143 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. Asia Pacific For fiscal 2005, net revenue from sales in Asia Pacific increased by 7.6 percent as compared to fiscal 2004. The increase in net revenue was driven primarily by higher sales of products in our Need for Speed franchise and sales of products in our Burnout franchise, which did not have a corresponding title release in the prior fiscal year, partially offset by declines in our Medal of Honor franchise. We estimate foreign exchange rates strengthened reported Asia Pacific net revenue by approximately $9 million, or 5 percent, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates, we estimate that Asia Pacific net revenue increased by approximately $4 million, or 3 percent, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. 27 Table of Contents Our total net revenue by product line for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 was as follows (in millions): Year Ended March 31, Increase/ % 2005 2004 (Decrease) Change Consoles PlayStation 2 $ 1,330 42.5 % $ 1,315 44.4 % $ 15 1.2 % Xbox 516 16.5 % 384 13.0 % 132 34.2 % Nintendo GameCube 212 6.8 % 200 6.8 % 12 5.8 % Other consoles 10 0.3 % 30 1.0 % (20 ) (66.5 %) Total Consoles 2,068 66.1 % 1,929 65.2 % 139 7.2 % PC 531 17.0 % 470 15.9 % 61 13.1 % Mobility Game Boy Advance 76 2.4 % 77 2.6 % (1 ) (1.2 %) Nintendo DS 23 0.8 % 0.0 % 23 N/M PSP 18 0.6 % 0.0 % 18 N/M Game Boy Color 1 0.0 % 1 0.0 % N/M Total Mobility 118 3.8 % 78 2.6 % 40 50.5 % Co publishing and Distribution 283 9.0 % 398 13.5 % (115 ) (28.9 %) Internet Services, Licensing and Other Subscription Services 55 1.7 % 49 1.7 % 6 11.5 % Licensing, Advertising and Other 74 2.4 % 33 1.1 % 41 123.8 % Total Internet Services, Licensing and Other 129 4.1 % 82 2.8 % 47 56.4 % Total Net Revenue $ 3,129 100.0 % $ 2,957 100.0 % $ 172 5.8 % PlayStation 2 Net revenue from PlayStation 2 products increased from $1,315 million in fiscal 2004 to $1,330 million in fiscal 2005. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of PlayStation 2 products decreased by 1.9 percent in fiscal 2005. Xbox Net revenue from Xbox products increased from $384 million in fiscal 2004 to $516 million in fiscal 2005. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of Xbox products increased by 3.5 percent in fiscal 2005. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to the continued growth in the Xbox installed base driven by Microsofts price reductions in the U.S. in March 2004 and in Europe in August 2004, as well as the overall greater demand for our products. Nintendo GameCube Net revenue from Nintendo GameCube products increased from $200 million in fiscal 2004 to $212 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in the installed base of the Nintendo GameCube. PC Net revenue from PC based products increased from $470 million in fiscal 2004 to $531 million in fiscal 2005. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of PC products increased by 1.1 percent in fiscal 2005. The increase 28 Table of Contents in PC net revenue was primarily due to higher sales of products in The Sims, Lord of the Rings and Need for Speed franchises, partially offset by a decrease in sales of products in our Command and Conquer and SimCity franchises. Mobility Net revenue from mobile products increased from $78 million in fiscal 2004 to $118 million in fiscal 2005. Mobile products include all mobile devices such as hand helds and cellular handsets. The increase in mobility net revenue was primarily due to the release of titles in conjunction with the launch of the Nintendo DS and PSP platforms in North America and Japan. Co Publishing and Distribution In fiscal 2005, net revenue from co publishing and distribution products decreased by $115 million to $283 million as compared to fiscal 2004. The decrease was primarily due to a significant decrease in the number of co publishing and distribution titles we released in fiscal 2005. We released six co publishing titles in fiscal 2005 as compared to 11 titles in fiscal 2004. Subscription Services In fiscal 2005, net revenue from subscription services products increased by $6 million to $55 million as compared to fiscal 2004. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of paying subscribers to Club Pogo, partially offset by a decrease in subscription net revenue from Earth & Beyondtm and The Simstm Online subscription services. Licensing, Advertising and Other In fiscal 2005, net revenue from licensing, advertising and other products increased by $41 million to $74 million as compared to fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to licensing revenue related to the Nokia N Gage platform. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold for our disk based and cartridge based products consists of (1) product costs, (2) certain royalty expenses for celebrities, professional sports and other organizations and independent software developers, (3) manufacturing royalties, net of volume discounts, (4) expenses for defective products, (5) write offs of post launch prepaid royalty costs, (6) amortization of certain intangible assets, and (7) operations expenses. Cost of goods sold for our online product subscription business consists primarily of data center and bandwidth costs associated with hosting our web sites, credit card fees and royalties for use of third party properties. Cost of goods sold for our web site advertising business primarily consists of ad serving costs. Costs of goods sold for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were (in millions): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2005 Revenue 2004 Revenue % Change $ 1,197 38.2% $ 1,103 37.3% 8.5% In fiscal 2005, cost of goods sold as a percentage of total net revenue increased 0.9 percent from 37.3 percent to 38.2 percent. As a percentage of total net revenue, the increase was primarily due to a 2.3 percent increase for: (1) pricing actions taken in both North America and Europe due to higher than anticipated channel inventory, (2) inventory related costs due to non recurring rebates across several titles, and (3) incremental costs incurred to produce our titles for the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP. In addition, warranty and online costs increased by 0.8 percent. 29 Table of Contents Offsetting these increases was a decrease of 2.2 percent, primarily the result of lower co publishing and distribution royalties due to the lower mix of co publishing and distribution net revenue during the year ended March 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2004. We expect cost of goods sold as a percentage of total net revenue to remain flat during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. We expect margin pressure as a result of a decrease in average selling prices as current generation platforms mature and our industry transitions to next generation technology and higher license royalty rates. Although there can be no assurance, and our actual results could differ materially, we expect this pressure to be essentially offset by lower manufacturing royalty rates, lower outside development expense and, to some extent, product mix. Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expenses consist of personnel related costs and advertising, marketing and promotional expenses, net of advertising expense reimbursements from third parties. Marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were (in millions): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2005 Revenue 2004 Revenue $ Change % Change $391 12.5 % $ 370 12.5 % $ 21 5.4 % Marketing and sales expenses increased by 5.4 percent, but remained flat as a percentage of net revenue, in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to: An increase of $21 million in headcount and facilities related expenses, both to help support the growth of our marketing and sales functions worldwide. An increase of $12 million in marketing related costs to support our fiscal 2005 releases. The increase in marketing and sales expenses was partially offset by the following: A decrease of $9 million in advertising expense as compared to the prior fiscal year. A decrease of $4 million in bonus expense as compared to the prior fiscal year. Marketing and sales expenses included vendor reimbursements for advertising expenses of $42 million and $45 million in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related expenses of executive and administrative staff, fees for professional services such as legal and accounting, gains (losses) on fixed asset disposals, and allowances for bad debts. General and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were (in millions): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2005 Revenue 2004 Revenue $ Change % Change $221 7.1 % $ 185 6.3 % $ 36 19.8 % General and administrative expenses increased by 19.8 percent, or 0.8 percent of net revenue, in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to: An increase of $48 million in employee related costs primarily due to (1) charges taken in connection with certain employee related litigation matters and (2) an increase in headcount and other personnel related costs to help support our administrative functions worldwide. An increase of $20 million in professional and contracted services, such as Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs, business development expenses and legal fees, along with other costs to support our business. 30 Table of Contents The increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by the following: A decrease of $17 million in facilities related expenses primarily due to accelerated depreciation on equipment and software that were replaced and due to write offs of assets that were taken out of service in the prior fiscal year. A decrease of $8 million in bonus expense as compared to the prior fiscal year. A decrease of $8 million in our investment in strategic university relationships. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred by our production studios for personnel related costs, consulting, equipment depreciation and any impairment of prepaid royalties for pre launch products. Research and development expenses for our online business include expenses incurred by our studios consisting of direct development costs and related overhead costs in connection with the development and production of our online games. Research and development expenses also include expenses associated with development of web site content, network infrastructure direct expenses, software licenses and maintenance, and network and management overhead. Research and development expenses for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were (in millions): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2005 Revenue 2004 Revenue $ Change % Change $633 20.2% $ 511 17.3% $ 122 24.0 % Research and development expenses increased by 24.0 percent, or 2.9 percent of net revenue, in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to: An increase of $103 million in personnel related costs resulting from a 30 percent increase in employee headcount primarily in our Canadian and European studios, which included $6 million of stock based employee compensation related to our acquisition of Criterion Software Group Ltd (Criterion). These increases were partially offset by a $20 million reduction in bonus expense as compared to the prior fiscal year. An increase of $19 million in external development expenses due to the development of new products with our co publishing partners and development costs for Renderware and mobile platforms. An increase of $18 million in facilities related expenses to help support the growth of our research and development functions worldwide. We expect research and development spending to continue to increase in total dollars and as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2006 as we continue to invest in next generation tools and technologies, products for new platforms, and, to a lesser extent, as we increase spending on titles for the PC and current generation console products. Acquired In process Technology Acquired in process technology charges for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were (in millions): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2005 Revenue 2004 Revenue $ Change % Change $13 0.4% $ 0.0% $ 13 N/M The acquired in process technology was the result of our acquisitions of 100 percent of Criterion and an additional 44 percent of Digital Illusions C.E. (DICE) during the year ended March 31, 2005. Acquired in process technology includes the value of products in the development stage that are not considered to have reached technological feasibility or have alternative future use. Accordingly, the acquired in process technology was expensed in the Consolidated Statement of Operations upon consummation of these acquisitions. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 31 Table of Contents Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net, for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 was (in millions): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2005 Revenue 2004 Revenue $ Change % Change $56 1.8% $ 21 0.7% $ 35 163.8% Interest and other income, net, in fiscal 2005 increased from fiscal 2004 primarily due to: An increase of $15 million in interest income, net, as a result of higher yields on higher average cash, cash equivalents and short term investments balances in fiscal 2005. An increase of $10 million due to gains on investments. An increase of $8 million due to a net gain from our foreign currency activities. Income Taxes Income taxes for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were (in millions): March 31, Effective March 31, Effective 2005 Tax Rate 2004 Tax Rate % Change $ 221 30.5% $ 220 27.5% 0.7% Our effective income tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from significant operations outside the U.S., which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent. The effective income tax rate was 30.5 percent for fiscal 2005 and 27.5 percent for fiscal 2004. Our increased effective income tax rate in fiscal 2005 primarily reflects the fact that we resolved certain tax related matters with the Internal Revenue Service during fiscal 2004, which lowered our fiscal 2004 income tax expense by approximately $20 million and resulted in a 2.5 percent rate reduction. Additionally, adjustments related to certain tax audit developments, a change in valuation allowance, and non deductible acquisition related costs, partially offset by the geographic mix of taxable income subject to lower tax rates for fiscal 2005, increased our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2005. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest our accumulated foreign earnings outside the United States, and, accordingly, have not provided for U.S. taxes that would be incurred if such earnings were repatriated back to the U.S. Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $896 million as of March 31, 2005. Our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2006 and future periods will depend on a variety of factors. For example, changes in our business, including acquisitions, changes in our international structure, changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in the geographic mix of income, as well as changes in, or termination of, our agreements with tax authorities, valuation allowances, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other matters, and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate for future fiscal years. In addition, we may incur additional tax expense to the extent we undertake certain international restructurings that we are considering. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act), enacted on October 22, 2004, provides for a temporary 85 percent dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated in fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2006. The deduction would result in an approximate 5.25 percent federal tax on a portion of the foreign earnings repatriated. State, local and foreign taxes could apply as well. To qualify for this federal tax deduction, the earnings must be reinvested in the United States pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by our chief executive officer and approved by the Board of Directors. Certain other criteria in the Jobs Act must be satisfied as well. The maximum amount of our foreign earnings that we may repatriate subject to the Jobs Act deduction is $500 million. We historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. taxes have been provided thereon. As a result of the Jobs Act, we are in the process 32 Table of Contents of evaluating whether we will change our intentions regarding a portion of our foreign earnings and take advantage of the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act, and if so, the amount that we would repatriate. We may not take advantage of the new law at all. In addition to not having made a decision to repatriate any foreign earnings, we are not yet in a position to accurately determine the impact of a qualifying repatriation, should we choose to make one, on our income tax expense for fiscal 2006. If we decide to repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings, we would be required to recognize income tax expense related to the federal, state, local and foreign taxes that we would incur on the repatriated earnings when the decision is made. We estimate that the reasonably possible amount of the income tax expense could be up to $35 million. We expect to be in a position to finalize our analysis no later than February 2006. Net Income Net income for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 was (in millions): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2005 Revenue 2004 Revenue $ Change % Change $504 16.1% $ 577 19.5% $ (73 ) (12.7 %) Reported net income decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to growth in our expenses, especially research and development, as we prepared for the adoption of next generation technology within our industry while at the same time we continued to devote resources to the development of products for current generation consoles. Comparison of Fiscal 2004 to Fiscal 2003 Net Revenue From a geographical perspective, our net revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004 and 2003 was as follows (in millions): Year Ended March 31, % 2004 2003 Increase Change North America $ 1,610 54.4 % $ 1,436 57.8 % $ 174 12.1 % Europe 1,180 39.9 % 879 35.4 % 301 34.3 % Asia Pacific 167 5.7 % 167 6.8 % (0.2 %) International 1,347 45.6 % 1,046 42.2 % 301 28.8 % Consolidated Net Revenue $ 2,957 100.0 % $ 2,482 100.0 % $ 475 19.1 % North America For fiscal 2004, net revenue in North America increased by 12.1 percent as compared to fiscal 2003. From a franchise perspective, the net revenue increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products released during the year ended March 31, 2004 in the following eight franchises: Need for Speed, NBA STREET, NFL STREET, Madden NFL, Def Jam, SSX, Tiger Woods/ PGA TOUR and MVP Baseball. Increased sales in these franchises resulted in an increase in net revenue of $353 million for the year ended March 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2003. Increases in net revenue from these franchises were partially offset by (1) a decrease in our Harry Potter franchise, as the fiscal 2004 title, Harry Pottertm: Quidditchtm World Cup, had no associated movie release, while our fiscal 2003 product, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was released in conjunction with the blockbuster movie of the same title, (2) the termination of our Square EA joint venture agreement, and (3) a decrease in net revenue in our Bond franchise as a result of the timing of the release of James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing (on all platforms except the Game Boy Advance) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, as compared to the strong sales of James Bond 007: NIGHTFIRE, which was released in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Together, lower sales in these franchises 33 Table of Contents reduced net revenue by $177 million for the year ended March 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2003. Europe For fiscal 2004, net revenue in Europe increased by 34.3 percent as compared to fiscal 2003. We estimate foreign exchange rates (primarily the Euro and the British pound sterling) strengthened reported European net revenue by approximately $136 million or 15 percent for the year ended March 31, 2004. From a franchise perspective, the net revenue increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products released during the year ended March 31, 2004 in the following eleven franchises: Need for Speed, The Sims, FIFA Soccer, Lord of the Rings, Medal of Honor, Final Fantasy, SSX, Football Manager, Freedom Fighters, Tiger Woods/ PGA TOUR and Rugby. Increased sales in these franchises resulted in an increase in net revenue of $373 million for the year ended March 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2003. The increase was partially offset by (1) a decrease in our Harry Potter franchise, as the fiscal 2004 title, Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup, had no associated movie release, while our fiscal 2003 product, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was released in conjunction with the blockbuster movie of the same title, and (2) an expected decrease in sales of our World Cup franchise due to strong sales in the year ended March 31, 2003 in conjunction with the World Cup event and no similar event in the year ended March 31, 2004. Together, the two items noted above, reduced net revenue by $92 million for the year ended March 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2003. Asia Pacific For fiscal 2004, net revenue from sales in our Asia Pacific region remained flat as compared to fiscal 2003. Although there were net revenue increases from our Need for Speed, The Sims and other franchises, these increases were offset by declines in the sales of products in our Harry Potter, World Cup and Final Fantasy franchises. We estimate foreign exchange rates strengthened reported Asia Pacific net revenue by approximately $21 million or 12.4 percent, for the year ended March 31, 2004. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates, we estimate that Asia Pacific net revenue decreased by approximately $21 million or 12.6 percent, for the year ended March 31, 2004. 34 Table of Contents Our net revenue by product line for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 is as follows (in millions): Year Ended March 31, Increase/ % 2004 2003 (Decrease) Change Consoles PlayStation 2 $ 1,315 44.4 % $ 911 36.7 % $ 404 44.4 % Xbox 384 13.0 % 219 8.8 % 165 75.2 % Nintendo GameCube 200 6.8 % 177 7.1 % 23 13.2 % Other consoles 30 1.0 % 100 4.0 % (70 ) (70.4 %) Total Consoles 1,929 65.2 % 1,407 56.6 % 522 37.1 % PC 470 15.9 % 499 20.2 % (29 ) (6.0 %) Mobility Game Boy Advance 77 2.6 % 79 3.2 % (2 ) (2.3 %) Game Boy Color 1 0.0 % 26 1.1 % (25 ) (96.6 %) Total Mobility 78 2.6 % 105 4.3 % (27 ) (25.8 %) Co publishing and Distribution 398 13.5 % 376 15.1 % 22 6.0 % Internet Services, Licensing and Other Subscription Services 49 1.7 % 45 1.8 % 4 10.9 % Licensing, Advertising and Other 33 1.1 % 50 2.0 % (17 ) (34.3 %) Total Internet Services, Licensing and Other 82 2.8 % 95 3.8 % (13 ) (13.0 %) Total Net Revenue $ 2,957 100.0 % $ 2,482 100.0 % $ 475 19.1 % PlayStation 2 Net revenue from PlayStation 2 products increased from $911 million in fiscal 2003 to $1,315 million in fiscal 2004. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of PlayStation 2 products increased by 7.7 percent in fiscal 2004. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in the installed base and greater demand for our products. Xbox Net revenue from Xbox products increased from $219 million in fiscal 2003 to $384 million in fiscal 2004. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of Xbox products increased by 4.2 percent in fiscal 2004. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in the installed base and greater demand for our products. Nintendo GameCube Net revenue from Nintendo GameCube products increased from $177 million in fiscal 2003 to $200 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in the installed base of the Nintendo GameCube. Other consoles In fiscal 2004, net revenue from Other consoles, primarily the PlayStation, decreased by $70 million to $30 million as compared to fiscal 2003. We anticipated the decline in net revenue from PlayStation products as we continued to transition away from that platform. 35 Table of Contents PC Net revenue from PC based products decreased from $499 million in fiscal 2003 to $470 million in fiscal 2004. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of PC products decreased by 4.3 percent in fiscal 2004. PC net revenue declined, largely due to declines of sales in the Harry Potter, World Cup and Bond franchises as discussed above, which were partially offset by an increase in sales of the Lord of the Rings franchise. Mobility Net revenue from mobile products decreased from $105 million in fiscal 2003 to $78 million in fiscal 2004. The decrease in mobility was primarily due to the expected decline in our Game Boy Color net revenue as we transitioned away from that platform. Co Publishing and Distribution In fiscal 2004, net revenue from co publishing and distribution products increased by $22 million to $398 million as compared to fiscal 2003. The increase was due to a $75 million increase in Europe primarily from increased sales in the Final Fantasy, Freedom Fighters and Battlefield franchises, partially offset by a decline in the Kingdom Hearts franchise in North America. Although co publishing and distribution net revenue increased, it declined as a percentage of total net revenue. Subscription Services In fiscal 2004, net revenue from subscription services products increased by $4 million to $49 million as compared to fiscal 2003. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to the number of subscribers to Club Pogo (launched in July 2003) and purchasers of Pogo Downloadables (launched in May 2003), partially offset by a decrease in subscription net revenue from The Simstm Online, Ultima Onlinetm, and Earth & Beyond tm subscription services. Licensing, Advertising and Other In fiscal 2004, net revenue from licensing, advertising and other products decreased by $17 million to $33 million as compared to fiscal 2003. The decrease was a result of expected declines in our advertising and programming net revenue following our renegotiation of the terms of our relationship with AOL during the three months ended June 30, 2003. Operations by Segment In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of the EA.com business segment into our core business because we began to consider online capability and gameplay as integral to our existing and future products. Accordingly, beginning April 1, 2003, we no longer managed our online products and services as a separate business segment, and we consolidated the reporting related to our online products and services into reporting for the overall development and publication of our core products for all reporting periods ending after that date. This change better reflected the way in which our Chief Executive Officer (our chief operating decision maker) reviews and manages our business and reflects the importance of our online products and services relative to the rest of our business. Concurrently, we eliminated separate reporting for our Class B common stock for all reporting periods ending after April 1, 2003. Fiscal 2003 has been restated to conform with fiscal 2004 presentation. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report. Our view and reporting of business segments may change due to changes in underlying business facts and circumstances and the evolution of our reporting to our Chief Executive Officer. 36 Table of Contents Cost of Goods Sold Costs of goods sold for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were (in millions): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2004 Revenue 2003 Revenue % Change $ 1,103 37.3% $ 1,073 43.2% 2.8% In fiscal 2004, cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 5.9 percentage points to 37.3 percent, from 43.2 percent for fiscal 2003, primarily due to a 3.3 percent decrease in product costs and a 2.8 percent decrease in royalty rates. The 3.3 percent decrease in product costs was primarily a result of: Lower co publishing and distribution product costs, as a percentage of net revenue, due to a higher mix of co publishing titles relative to distribution titles in fiscal 2004. Co publishing titles generally have higher gross margins than distribution titles. Lower co publishing and distribution costs, as a percentage of net revenue, increased total gross margin by 1.6 percent in fiscal 2004. Lower average manufacturing costs increased total gross margin by 1.0 percent in fiscal 2004. Lower period costs primarily due to improved inventory management in North America. Lower period costs increased total gross margin by 0.5 percent in fiscal 2004. The 2.8 percent decrease in royalty rates was primarily the result of: Decreased third party development royalties primarily due to a higher mix of titles developed internally rather than externally in fiscal 2004. Significant titles that were developed internally in fiscal 2004 for which a comparable title had been developed externally in fiscal 2003 included James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing and The Lord of the Rings; The Return of the King. We estimate that lower development royalties increased gross margin by 1.9 percent, which was spread across multiple platforms. Lower license royalties, as a percentage of net revenue, as Need for Speed Underground, our highest grossing title of fiscal 2004, had a significantly lower license royalty rate than Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, our highest grossing title of fiscal 2003. Lower license royalties, as a percentage of net revenue, increased total gross margin by 1.1 percent in fiscal 2004. Marketing and Sales In fiscal 2003, marketing and sales expense included the amortization of the carriage fees payable for the distribution of our online games on AOL, which we are no longer required to pay. Marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were (in millions): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2004 Revenue 2003 Revenue $ Change % Change $ 370 12.5% $ 332 13.4% $ 38 11.4% Marketing and sales expenses increased by 11.4 percent in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to: An increase in our advertising, contract services and promotional expenses of $38 million as we incrementally increased our advertising campaigns to support the release of new titles. A 13.6 percent increase in average headcount to further support the growth of our marketing and sales functions worldwide, which resulted in an increase to personnel related costs of approximately $17 million. The increase in marketing and sales expenses was partially offset by the discontinuance of carriage fee payments to AOL, which resulted in a decrease of $18 million. 37 Table of Contents As a percentage of net revenue, marketing and sales expenses declined from 13.4 percent in fiscal 2003 to 12.5 percent in fiscal 2004. Marketing and sales expenses included vendor reimbursements for advertising expenses of $45 million in fiscal 2004 and $28 million in fiscal 2003. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were (in millions): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2004 Revenue 2003 Revenue $ Change % Change $ 185 6.3% $ 131 5.3% $ 54 41.2% General and administrative expenses increased by 41.2 percent, or 1.0 percent of net revenue, in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to: An increase in depreciation expense of approximately $18 million primarily due to accelerated depreciation on equipment and software that are being replaced and due to write offs of assets that have been taken out of service in fiscal 2004. An increase of approximately 9 percent, or $15 million, in personnel related costs to support the continued growth of our business. An increase in contributions of $8 million as we invest in our strategic university relationships. An increase of approximately $11 million in professional services. An increase of approximately $10 million in information technology and facilities expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of $9 million, primarily as a result of collecting on accounts that we had previously deemed uncollectible. Research and Development Research and development expenses for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were (in millions): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2004 Revenue 2003 Revenue $ Change % Change $ 511 17.3% $ 401 16.1% $ 110 27.4% Research and development expenses increased by 27.4 percent, or 1.2 percentage points of net revenue, in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to: Increases in personnel related costs of $101 million of which approximately $64 million resulted from a 22.2 percent increase in average regular full time employee headcount. An overall increase in external development expenses of $23 million related to development of new products. The increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and other operating expenses due to asset impairments recognized in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was (in millions): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2004 Revenue 2003 Revenue $ Change % Change $ 3 0.1% $ 8 0.3% $ (5 ) (63.4% ) Amortization of intangibles resulted primarily from our acquisitions of Westwood, Kesmai, DreamWorks Interactive, ABC Software, Pogo and other acquisitions. The decline in amortization was a result of the impairment charges taken in fiscal 2003. 38 Table of Contents Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges Restructuring and asset impairment charges for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were (in millions): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2004 Revenue 2003 Revenue % Change Restructuring Charges $ 9 0.3% $ 15 0.6% (35.7% ) Asset Impairment Charges $ 0.0% $ 66 2.7% (100.0% ) Fiscal 2004 Studio Restructuring During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we closed the majority of our leased studio facility in Walnut Creek, California and our entire owned studio facility in Austin, Texas in order to consolidate local development efforts in Redwood City, California. We recorded total pre tax charges of $9 million, consisting of $7 million for consolidation of facilities (net of expected future sublease income), $2 million for workforce reductions of approximately 117 personnel and less than $1 million for the write off of non current assets, primarily leasehold improvements. Fiscal 2003 Studio Restructuring During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we closed our office located in San Francisco, California and our studio located in Seattle, Washington in order to consolidate local development efforts in Redwood City, California and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. We recorded total pre tax charges of $9 million, consisting of $7 million for consolidation of facilities (net of expected future sublease income), $1 million for the write off of non current assets, primarily leasehold improvements, and $1 million for workforce reductions of approximately 33 personnel. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we approved a plan to consolidate the Los Angeles, California, Irvine, California and Las Vegas, Nevada, studios into one major game studio in Los Angeles. We recorded a total pre tax restructuring charge of $5 million, including $2 million for the shutdown of facilities and associated costs, $2 million for the write off of non current assets, primarily leasehold improvements and $1 million for workforce reductions. Fiscal 2003 Online Restructuring In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of EA.com into our core business, and eliminated separate reporting for our Class B common stock for all future reporting periods after fiscal 2003. We recorded restructuring charges, including asset impairment, of $67 million, consisting of $2 million for workforce reductions of approximately 50 personnel, $2 million for consolidation of facilities and $63 million for the write off of non current assets. The consolidation of facilities resulted in the closure of EA.coms Chicago and Virginia facilities and an adjustment for the closure of EA.coms San Diego studio in fiscal 2002. As part of the restructuring efforts, we performed impairment tests under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, to evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets and remaining finite lived identifiable intangible assets utilized in the EA.com business. This test was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 in conjunction with the overall valuation of the EA.com legal entity and its Class B common stock. As of March 31, 2003, the unit sales and the number of subscribers for The Sims Online, our flagship EA.com product, and overall EA.com performance were significantly below our expectations, which we considered to be a triggering event under SFAS No. 144. These results caused us to cancel most of our plans to develop similar online products that would have utilized the long lived assets associated with the EA.com business. Impairment charges on long lived assets amounted to $63 million and included $25 million relating to impaired customized internal use software systems for the EA.com infrastructure, $26 million for other long lived assets and $12 million of finite lived intangibles impairment charges relating to EA.coms acquisitions of Kesmai Corporation and Pogo Corporation. 39 Table of Contents Fiscal 2002 Online Restructuring In October 2001, we announced restructuring initiatives involving EA.com and the closure of EA.coms San Diego studio and consolidation of our San Francisco and Virginia facilities. As a result, we recorded restructuring charges of $20 million, consisting of $4 million for workforce reductions, $3 million for consolidation of facilities and other administrative charges and $13 million for the write off of non current assets and facilities. All restructuring charges recorded prior to December 31, 2002 were recorded in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring), EITF No. 95 03, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination, and SAB No. 100, Restructuring and Impairment Charges. All restructuring charges recorded subsequent to December 31, 2002, were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Adjustments to the restructuring reserves will be made in future periods, if necessary, based upon the then current events and circumstances. The following table reflects our unaudited pro forma consolidated basic earnings per share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 as if the consolidation of the operations of our EA.com business segment into our core business had occurred at the beginning of the period (in millions, except per share data): Year Ended March 31, 2003 Net income: As reported $ 317 Pro forma $ 317 Earnings per share: As reported $ 1.17 Pro forma $ 1.12 Number of shares used in computation: As reported 282 Add: conversion of AOL and News Corp Class B 1 Pro forma 283 For further discussion on our restructurings and asset impairment charges, see Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report. Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was (in millions): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2004 Revenue 2003 Revenue $ Change % Change $21 0.7% $5 0.2% $16 N/M Interest and other income, net, in fiscal 2004 increased from fiscal 2003 primarily due to the following: Interest income increased by $8 million in fiscal 2004 as a result of higher average cash balances in that year. During the year ended March 31, 2003, we recorded $11 million for other than temporary impairments of investments in affiliates, offset by income of $5 million recorded from our equity investment in Square EA, LLC. 40 Table of Contents Income Taxes Income taxes for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were (in millions): March 31, Effective March 31, Effective 2004 Tax Rate 2003 Tax Rate % Change $ 220 27.5% $ 143 31.0% 53.3% Our effective income tax rate reflected tax benefits derived from significant operations outside the U.S., which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent. The effective income tax rate was 27.5 percent for fiscal 2004 and 31.0 percent for fiscal 2003. The reduced effective income tax rate in fiscal 2004 primarily reflected the resolution of certain tax related matters with the Internal Revenue Service in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, which lowered our income tax expense by $20 million and resulted in a 2.5 percent rate reduction, and also reflected a change in the geographic mix of taxable income subject to lower tax rates. Net Income Net income for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was (in millions): March 31, % of Net March 31, % of Net 2004 Revenue 2003 Revenue $ Change % Change $577 19.5% $ 317 12.8% $ 260 82.1% Reported net income increased in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to the reasons discussed above. Although the dollar amount of our expenses increased in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, net income as a percentage of net revenue increased to 19.5 percent as compared to 12.8 percent in fiscal 2003 as expenses, including our cost of goods sold, grew at a slower rate than did our net revenue. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ratified the other than temporary impairment measurement and recognition guidance and certain disclosure requirements for impaired securities as described in EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. In September 2004, the FASB issued a proposed Staff Position (FSP) EITF Issue No. 03 1 a, Implementation Guidance for the Application of Paragraph 16 of EITF 03 1. The proposed FSP will provide measurement and recognition guidance with respect to debt securities that are impaired solely due to interest rates and or sector spreads. In October 2004, the FASB delayed the effective date for the other than temporary impairment measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 until FSP Issue No. 03 1 a is issued. However, this delay does not suspend the requirement to recognize other than temporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature; nor does it delay the required disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments in paragraphs 21 22 of EITF Issue No. 03 1. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Management is unable to determine what impact the adoption of the measurement and recognition guidance in EITF Issue No. 03 1 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) and requires that those items be recognized as current period charges. SFAS No. 151 also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Management believes the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchange of Non monetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. SFAS No. 153 amends Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 29, Accounting 41 Table of Contents for Non monetary Transactions, to eliminate the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is effective for non monetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Management believes the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements using a fair value based method. The statement replaces SFAS No. 123, supersedes APB No. 25, and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. While the fair value method under SFAS No. 123R is very similar to the fair value method under SFAS No. 123 with regards to measurement and recognition of stock based compensation, management is currently evaluating the impact of several of the key differences between the two standards on our consolidated financial statements. For example, SFAS No. 123 permits us to recognize forfeitures as they occur while SFAS No. 123R will require us to estimate future forfeitures and adjust our estimate on a quarterly basis. SFAS No. 123R also will require a classification change in the statement of cash flows, whereby a portion of the tax benefit from stock options will move from operating cash flow activities to financing cash flow activities (total cash flows will remain unchanged). In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released SAB No. 107, Share based Payment, which provides the views of the staff regarding the interaction between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations for public companies. In April 2005, the SEC adopted a rule that amends the compliance dates of SFAS No. 123R. Under the revised compliance dates, we will be required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R no later than the first interim period of fiscal 2007. While management continues to evaluate the impact of SFAS No. 123R on our consolidated financial statements, we currently believe that the expensing of stock based compensation will have an impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations similar to our pro forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123, as amended. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Year Ended March 31, March 31, 2005 2004 Increase (In millions) Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments $ 2,958 $ 2,414 $ 544 Marketable equity securities 140 1 139 Total $ 3,098 $ 2,415 $ 683 Percentage of total assets 70.9 % 69.7 % Year Ended March 31, March 31, 2005 2004 Decrease (In millions) Cash provided by operating activities $ 634 $ 669 $ (35 ) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities (1,726 ) 288 (2,014 ) Cash provided by financing activities 200 225 (25 ) Effect of foreign exchange on cash and cash equivalents 12 18 (6 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (880 ) $ 1,200 $ (2,080 ) Changes in Cash Flow During the year ended March 31, 2005, we generated $634 million of cash from operating activities as compared to $669 million for the year ended March 31, 2004. This decline was primarily the result of (1) our 42 Table of Contents overall decline in net income for fiscal 2005, (2) higher accounts receivable balances due to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and (3) higher cash payments for income taxes. These declines were partially offset by higher balances in our current liabilities. We expect to continue to generate significant operating cash flow in fiscal 2006. For the year ended March 31, 2005, our primary use of cash in non operating activities consisted of net purchases of $1,446 million in short term investments, $126 million in capital expenditures, primarily related to the expansions of our Los Angeles and Vancouver studios as well as upgrades to our worldwide ERP systems, $90 million for our purchase of a 19.9 percent investment in Ubisoft, $81 million for our acquisitions of 100 percent of Criterion and an additional 44 percent of DICE, and $41 million towards the repurchase and retirement of our common stock. These non operating expenditures were partially offset by $241 million in proceeds from the sale of our common stock through stock plans and $16 million in proceeds from the sale of property during the year ended March 31, 2005. We anticipate making continued capital investments in our Vancouver studio during fiscal 2006 as well as completing the remaining $709 million of our $750 million share repurchase program by September 30, 2005. Short term investments and marketable equity securities The composition of our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments changed from primarily cash equivalents, which were $1.991 billion as of March 31, 2004, to primarily short term investments, which were $1.688 billion as of March 31, 2005 and, therefore, our portfolio is more susceptible to changes in short term interest rates. As of March 31, 2005, our short term investments had gross unrealized losses of approximately $22 million or 1.3 percent of the total in short term investments. From time to time, we may liquidate some or all of our short term investments to fund operational needs or other activities, such as capital expenditures, business acquisitions, or stock repurchase programs. Depending on the short term investments that we liquidate to fund these activities, we could recognize a portion of the gross unrealized losses. Marketable equity securities increased to $140 million as of March 31, 2005, from $1 million as of March 31, 2004, primarily due to our purchase of a 19.9 percent investment in Ubisoft Entertainment. Receivables, net Our gross accounts receivable balance was $458 million and $367 million as of March 31, 2005 and March 31, 2004, respectively. The increase in our accounts receivable balance was primarily due to an increase in our fourth quarter gross sales (prior to reserve adjustments) versus the prior year and the timing of those sales, which occurred later in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 than in the prior year. We expect to collect a substantial portion of these amounts in the three months ended June 30, 2005. Reserves for sales returns, pricing allowances and doubtful accounts increased from $155 million as of March 31, 2004 to $162 million as of March 31, 2005. Both the sales return and price protection reserves increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of trailing six month net revenue and remained relatively flat as a percentage of trailing nine month net revenue as of March 31, 2005. We believe these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of potential returns and allowances. Inventories Inventories increased to $62 million as of March 31, 2005 from $55 million as of March 31, 2004 primarily due to overall growth in Europe. We typically have a higher inventory balance, as a percentage of net revenue, on hand in Europe than in North America, due to the need to provide multiple language versions of each title in that region. No single title represented more than $4 million of inventory as of March 31, 2005. Other current assets Other current assets increased to $164 million as of March 31, 2005, from $163 million as of March 31, 2004, primarily due to the amortization of certain prepaid amounts and collections of advertising credits owed to us by our suppliers offset by higher prepaid royalties as we continue to invest in our product development. 43 Table of Contents Accounts payable Accounts payable increased to $134 million as of March 31, 2005, from $114 million as of March 31, 2004, primarily due to higher gross sales volumes and an extension of payment terms with our vendors in fiscal 2005. Accrued and other liabilities Our accrued and other liabilities increased to $694 million as of March 31, 2005 from $630 million as of March 31, 2004. The increase was due to increases in income taxes payable, accruals for pending litigation and increases to our deferred rent and deferred revenue, offset by a decrease in royalties payable and accrued payroll and related expenses. We anticipate our accrued and other liabilities balance will decline following our bonus payments during the three months ended June 30, 2005. Financial Condition We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, marketable equity securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures, potential future acquisitions or strategic investments, and funding of our stock repurchase program. We may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position, facilitate expansion, pursue strategic investments or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. There can be no guarantee that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all, or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. Our two lease agreements with Keybank National Association, described in the Off Balance Sheet Commitments section below, are scheduled to expire in June 2006 and July 2006. We currently are evaluating whether to extend the leases, purchase the properties under lease, or identify a third party buyer for the properties when the leases expire. Should we choose to renew the leases, we would not expect a material change in our lease payments from the amounts under the current lease agreements. Should we choose to purchase the properties, we could incur a cash outflow of at least $200 million. We have not yet determined the course of action that we will take. A portion of our cash that was generated from operations domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions (approximately $987 million as of March 31, 2005) is designated as indefinitely reinvested in the respective tax jurisdiction. While we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the United States in the short term, if we were required to do so in order to fund our operations in the United States, we would accrue and pay additional taxes in connection with their repatriation. We are in the process of evaluating whether we will repatriate foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act. On October 18, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $750 million of shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the authorization, we may repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions over the course of a twelve month period. During the year ended March 31, 2005, we repurchased and retired 805,500 shares of our common stock for approximately $41 million. We have a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This shelf registration statement, which includes a base prospectus, allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings up to a total amount of $2.0 billion. Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus, we will use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including for working capital, financing capital expenditures, research and development, marketing and distribution efforts and, if opportunities arise, for acquisitions or strategic alliances. Pending such uses, we may invest the net proceeds in interest bearing securities. In addition, we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time. Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those related to customer demand and acceptance of our titles on new platforms and new 44 Table of Contents versions of our titles on existing platforms, our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due, successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives, the impact of competition, the economic conditions in the domestic and international markets, seasonality in operating results, risks of product returns and the other risks described in the Risk Factors section below. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Letters of Credit In July 2002, we provided an irrevocable standby letter of credit to Nintendo of Europe. The standby letter of credit guarantees performance of our obligations to pay Nintendo of Europe for trade payables of up to 18 million. The standby letter of credit expires in July 2005. As of March 31, 2005, we had 0.5 million payable to Nintendo of Europe covered by this standby letter of credit. In August 2003, we provided an irrevocable standby letter of credit to 300 California Associates II, LLC in replacement of our security deposit for office space. The standby letter of credit guarantees performance of our obligations to pay our lease commitment up to approximately $1 million. The standby letter of credit expires in December 2006. As of March 31, 2005, we did not have a payable balance on this standby letter of credit. Development, Celebrity, League and Content Licenses: Payments and Commitments The products produced by our studios are designed and created by our employee designers, artists, software programmers and by non employee software developers (independent artists or third party developers). We typically advance development funds to the independent artists and third party developers during development of our games, usually in installment payments made upon the completion of specified development milestones. Contractually, these payments are considered advances against subsequent royalties on the sales of the products. These terms are set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists and third party developers. In addition, we have certain celebrity, league and content license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments that are not dependent on any deliverables. Celebrities and organizations with whom we have contracts include: ESPN (content in EA SPORTS games); FIFA and UEFA (professional soccer); NASCAR (stock car racing); John Madden (professional football); National Basketball Association (professional basketball); PGA TOUR (professional golf); Tiger Woods (professional golf); National Hockey League and NHLPA (professional hockey); Warner Bros. (Harry Potter, Batman and Superman); MGM/ Danjaq (James Bond); New Line Productions (The Lord of the Rings); National Football League, Arena Football League and PLAYERS Inc. (professional football); Collegiate Licensing Company (collegiate football and basketball); ISC (stock car racing); Island Def Jam (fighting); and Viacom Consumer Products (The Godfather). These developer and content license commitments represent the sum of (i) the cash payments due under non royalty bearing licenses and services agreements, and (ii) the minimum payments and advances against royalties due under royalty bearing licenses and services agreements, the majority of which are conditional upon performance by the counterparty. These minimum guarantee payments and any related marketing commitments are included in the table below. 45 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of March 31, 2005, and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions): Contractual Obligations Commercial Commitments Developer/ Letters Fiscal Year Licensor Bank and of Ended March 31, Leases(1) Commitments(2) Marketing Other Guarantees Credit Total 2006 $ 30 $ 134 $ 33 $ 4 $ 1 $ 202 2007 24 131 34 189 2008 20 128 30 178 2009 15 136 30 181 2010 12 124 31 167 Thereafter 35 830 197 1,062 Total $ 136 $ 1,483 $ 355 $ 4 $ 1 $ 1,979 (1) See discussion on operating leases in the Off Balance Sheet Commitments section herein and Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report, for additional information. (2) Developer/licensor commitments include $50 million of commitments to developers or licensors that have been included in both current and long term assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2005 because the developer or licensor does not have any performance obligations to us. In addition, our developer/licensor and marketing commitments increased significantly in the latter half of fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of agreements we renewed with the National Football League and PLAYERS Inc., as well as an exclusive, long term agreement we entered into with ESPN Inc. (ESPN) for the development and integrated marketing of ESPN content in EA SPORTS games beginning in calendar 2006. While our commitments with ESPN are not contractually due until fiscal 2011 and beyond and are presented as such in the table above, we anticipate paying these commitments earlier as we publish titles associated with the agreement. The lease commitments disclosed above exclude commitments included in our restructuring activities for contractual rental commitments of $23 million under real estate leases for unutilized office space, offset by $13 million of estimated future sub lease income. These amounts were expensed in the periods of the related restructuring and are included in our accrued and other liabilities reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2005. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report, for additional information. Transactions with Related Parties On June 24, 2002, we hired Warren Jenson as our Chief Financial and Administrative Officer and agreed to loan him $4,000,000, to be forgiven over four years based on his continuing employment. The loan does not bear interest. On June 24, 2004, pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement, we forgave two million dollars of the loan and provided Mr. Jenson approximately $1.6 million to offset the tax implications of the forgiveness. As of March 31, 2005, the remaining outstanding loan balance was $2,000,000, which will be forgiven on June 24, 2006, provided that Mr. Jenson has not voluntarily resigned his employment with us or been terminated for cause prior to that time. No additional funds will be provided to offset the tax implications of the forgiveness of the remaining two million dollars. 46 Table of Contents OFF BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS Lease Commitments We lease certain of our current facilities and certain equipment under non cancelable operating lease agreements. We are required to pay property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs for certain of our facilities and will be required to pay any increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder of our facilities. In February 1995, we entered into a build to suit lease with a third party for our headquarters facility in Redwood City, California, which was refinanced with Keybank National Association in July 2001 and expires in July 2006. We accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, as amended. Existing campus facilities developed in phase one comprise a total of 350,000 square feet and provide space for sales, marketing, administration and research and development functions. We have an option to purchase the property (land and facilities) for a maximum of $145 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for (i) an extension of the lease or (ii) sale of the property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up to $129 million if the sales price is less than this amount, subject to certain provisions of the lease. In December 2000, we entered into a second build to suit lease with Keybank National Association for a five and one half year term beginning December 2000 to expand our Redwood City, California headquarters facilities and develop adjacent property adding approximately 310,000 square feet to our campus. Construction was completed in June 2002. We accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, as amended. The facilities provide space for sales, marketing, administration and research and development functions. We have an option to purchase the property for a maximum of $130 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for (i) an extension of the lease, or (ii) sale of the property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up to $119 million if the sales price is less than this amount, subject to certain provisions of the lease. We believe the estimated fair values of both properties under these operating leases are in excess of their respective guaranteed residual values as of March 31, 2005. For the two lease agreements with Keybank National Association, as described above, the lease rates are based upon the Commercial Paper Rate and require us to maintain certain financial covenants as shown below, all of which we were in compliance with as of March 31, 2005. Actual as of Financial Covenants Requirement March 31, 2005 Consolidated Net Worth (in millions) $ 2,061 $ 3,498 Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio 3.00 19.93 Total Consolidated Debt to Capital 60 % 6.6 % Quick Ratio Q1 & Q2 1.00 N/A Q3 & Q4 1.75 13.07 As our two lease agreements with Keybank National Association are scheduled to expire in June 2006 and July 2006, we currently are evaluating whether to extend the leases, purchase the properties under lease, or identify a third party buyer for the properties when the leases expire. We have not yet determined the course of action that we will take. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section above for additional information. In July 2003, we entered into a lease agreement with an independent third party (the Landlord) for a studio facility in Los Angeles, California, which commenced in October 2003 and expires in September 2013 with two five year options to extend the lease term. Additionally, we have options to purchase the property after five and ten years based on the fair market value of the property at the date of sale, a right of first offer to purchase the property upon terms offered by the Landlord, and a right to share in the profits from a sale of the property. 47 Table of Contents We have accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, as amended. Existing campus facilities comprise a total of 243,000 square feet and provide space for research and development functions. Our rental obligation under this agreement is $50 million over the initial ten year term of the lease. This commitment is offset by sublease income of $6 million for the sublet to an affiliate of the Landlord of 18,000 square feet of the Los Angeles facility, which commenced in October 2003 and expires in September 2013, with options of early termination by the affiliate after five years and by us after four and five years. In June 2004, we entered into a lease agreement with an independent third party for a studio facility in Orlando, Florida, which commenced in January 2005 and expires in June 2010, with one five year option to extend the lease term. The campus facilities comprise a total of 117,000 square feet, which we intend to use for research and development functions. We have accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, as amended. Our rental obligation over the initial five and a half year term of the lease is $13 million. Litigation On July 29, 2004, a class action lawsuit, Kirschenbaum v. Electronic Arts Inc., was filed against us in Superior Court in San Mateo, California. The complaint alleges that we improperly classified Image Production Employees in California as exempt employees and seeks injunctive relief, unspecified monetary damages, interest and attorneys fees. The complaint was first amended on or about November 30, 2004 to add two former employees as named plaintiffs, and amended again on or about January 5, 2005 to add another former employee as a named plaintiff. The allegations in the complaint were not materially changed by the amendments. On February 14, 2005, a second employment related class action lawsuit, Hasty v. Electronic Arts Inc., was filed against us in Superior Court in San Mateo, California. The complaint alleges that we improperly classified Engineers in California as exempt employees and seeks injunctive relief, unspecified monetary damages, interest and attorneys fees. On or about March 16, 2005, we received a first amended complaint, which contains the same material allegations as the original complaint. We answered the first amended complaint on April 20, 2005. On March 24, 2005, a purported class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our officers and directors. The complaint, which asserts claims under Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on allegedly false and misleading statements, was filed in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, by an individual purporting to represent a class of purchasers of EA common stock. Additional purported class action lawsuits have been filed in the same court by other individuals asserting the same claims against us. We have not yet responded to any of the complaints. In addition, on April 12, 2005, a shareholder derivative action was filed against certain of our officers and directors. This suit asserts claims based on substantially the same factual allegations set forth in the federal class action lawsuits. The complaint was filed in San Mateo Superior Court. On April 13, 2005, a second shareholder derivative action was filed in San Mateo Superior Court based on the same claims as the first complaint. On May 16, 2005, a shareholder derivative action based on substantially the same allegations was filed in the United States District Court, Northern District of California. We have not responded to the shareholder derivative complaints. In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Our management considers that any liability from any reasonably foreseeable disposition of such other claims and litigation, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Director Indemnity Agreements We have entered into indemnification agreement with the members of our Board of Directors to indemnify them to the extent permitted by law against any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, amounts paid in settlement 48 Table of Contents and damages incurred by the directors as a result of any lawsuit, or any judicial, administrative or investigative proceeding in which the directors are sued as a result of their service as members of our Board of Directors. INFLATION We believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant for each of the past three fiscal years. RISK FACTORS Our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance. If any of the events or circumstances described below occurs, our business and financial performance could be harmed, our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our securities could decline. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance. Our business is highly dependent on the success and timely release of new video game platforms, on the continued availability of existing video game platforms, as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms. We derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on video game platforms manufactured by third parties, such as Sonys PlayStation 2 and Microsofts Xbox. The success of our business is driven in large part by the availability of an adequate supply of current generation video game platforms, the timely release and success of new video game hardware systems, our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful in the marketplace, and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms. We must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform. A new platform for which we are developing products may be delayed, may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated. If the platforms for which we are developing products are not released when anticipated, are not available in adequate amounts to meet consumer demand, or do not attain wide market acceptance, our revenue will suffer, we may be unable to fully recover the resources we have committed, and our financial performance will be harmed. Our industry is cyclical and has entered a transition period heading into the next cycle. During the transition, we expect our costs to increase, we may experience a decline in sales as consumers anticipate and adopt next generation products and our operating results may suffer and become more difficult to predict. Video game platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years, which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well. Sonys PlayStation 2 was introduced in 2000 and Microsofts Xbox and the Nintendo GameCube were introduced in 2001. Over the course of the next eighteen months, we expect Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo to introduce new video game platforms into the market (so called next generation platforms). As a result, we believe that the interactive entertainment industry has entered into a transition stage leading into the next cycle. During this transition, we intend to continue developing new titles for the current generation of video game platforms while we also make significant investments preparing to introduce products upon the launch of the next generation platforms. We have and expect to continue to incur increased costs during the transition to next generation platforms, which are not likely to be offset in the near future. We also expect development costs for next generation video games to be greater on a per title basis than development costs for current generation video games. Further, we expect that, as the current generation of platforms reaches the end of its cycle and next generation platforms are introduced into the market, sales of video games for current generation consoles may begin to decline. Consumers may defer game software purchases until the next generation platforms become available. This decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new platforms. For example, following the launch of Sonys PlayStation 2 platform, we experienced a significant decline in revenue from sales of products for Sonys older PlayStation game console, which was not immediately offset by revenue generated from sales of products for the PlayStation 2 49 Table of Contents platform. If the increased costs we have incurred and expect to continue to incur are not offset during the transition, our operating results will suffer and our financial position will be harmed. In addition, during this transition, we expect our operating results to be more volatile and difficult to predict, which could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly. Our platform licensors set the royalty rates and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their platforms, and therefore have significant influence on our costs. If one or more of the platform licensors adopt a different fee structure for future game consoles or we are unable to obtain such licenses, our profitability will be materially impacted. In the next eighteen months, we expect our platform licensors to introduce new video game platforms into the market. For example, Microsoft and Sony have indicated that they plan to release next generation successors to the Xbox and PlayStation 2, respectively, over the course of the next eighteen months. In order to publish products for a new game machine, we must take a license from the platform licensor which gives the platform licensor the opportunity to set the fee structure that we must pay in order to publish games for that platform. Similarly, certain platform licensors have retained the flexibility to change their fee structures for online gameplay and features for their consoles. The control that platform licensors have over the fee structures for their future platforms and online access makes it difficult for us to predict our costs and profitability in the medium to long term. It is also possible that platform licensors will not renew our licenses. Because publishing products for video game consoles is the largest portion of our business, any increase in fee structures or failure to secure a license relationship would significantly harm our ability to generate revenues and or profits. If we do not consistently meet our product development schedules, our operating results will be adversely affected. Our business is highly seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand, and a significant percentage of our revenue, occurring in the December quarter. In addition, we seek to release many of our products in conjunction with specific events, such as the release of a related movie or the beginning of a sports season or major sporting event. If we miss these key selling periods, due to product delays or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products, our sales will suffer disproportionately. Our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors, including the creative processes involved, the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams required by the increasing complexity of our products, and the need to refine and tune our products prior to their release. We have in the past experienced development delays for several of our products. Failure to meet anticipated production or go live schedules may cause a shortfall in our revenue and profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different from expectations. If the average price of current generation titles continues to decline, our operating results will suffer. As a result of a more value oriented consumer base caused by price reductions in current generation platforms by Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, a greater number of current generation titles being published, and significant pricing pressure from our competitors, we have experienced a decrease in the average price of our titles for current generation platforms. Although we believe that a few of the most popular current generation titles will continue to be launched at premium price points, as the interactive entertainment industry transitions to next generation video game platforms, we expect there to be fewer current generation titles able to command premium price points, and we expect that even these titles will be subject to price reductions at an earlier point in their sales cycle than we have seen in prior years. We expect the average price of current generation titles to continue to decline, which will have a negative effect on our margins and operating results. Technology changes rapidly in our business, and if we fail to anticipate or successfully implement new technologies, the quality, timeliness and competitiveness of our products and services will suffer. Rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies we must implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market. Therefore, we usually start our product development with a range of technical 50 Table of Contents development goals that we hope to be able to achieve. We may not be able to achieve these goals, or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we can. In either case, our products and services may be technologically inferior to our competitors, less appealing to consumers, or both. If we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products and services, then we may delay their release until these technology goals can be achieved, which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses. Alternatively, we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies, either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition, which would increase our development expenses. Our business is intensely competitive and hit driven. If we do not continue to deliver hit products or if consumers prefer our competitors products over our own, our operating results could suffer. Competition in our industry is intense and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge. While many new products are regularly introduced only a relatively small number of hit titles accounts for a significant portion of net revenue. Hit products published by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate, which could cause our product sales to fall below our expectations. If our competitors develop more successful products, offer competitive products at lower price points, or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and well received products, our revenue, margins, and profitability will decline. If we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to intellectual property, we will publish fewer hit titles and our revenue, profitability and cash flows will decline. Competition for these licenses may make them more expensive, and increase our costs. Many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others. For example, our EA SPORTS products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players associations. Similarly, many of our hit EA GAMEStm franchises, such as Bond, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, are based on key film and literary licenses. Competition for these licenses is intense. If we are unable to maintain these licenses and obtain additional licenses with significant commercial value, our revenues and profitability will decline significantly. Competition for these licenses may also drive up the advances, guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor, which could significantly increase our costs. If patent claims continue to be asserted against us, we may be unable to sustain our current business models or profits. Many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used game technologies. Additionally, infringement claims under many recently issued patents are now being asserted against Internet implementations of existing games. Several such claims have been asserted against us. Such claims can harm our business. We incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims, regardless of the merits of the claims. In the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a third party patent, we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future, which could negatively impact our operating results. Other intellectual property claims may increase our product costs or require us to cease selling affected products. Many of our products include extremely realistic graphical images, and we expect that as technology continues to advance, images will become even more realistic. Some of the images and other content are based on real world examples that may inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others, it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement. From time to time, we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims. Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid or not, may be time consuming and expensive to defend. Such claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the affected products, redesign those products to avoid infringement, or obtain a license, all of which would be costly and harm our business. 51 Table of Contents From time to time we may become involved in other litigation which could adversely affect us. We are currently, and from time to time in the future may become, subject to other claims and litigation, which could be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. In addition, the outcome of any claims or litigation may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. For further information regarding certain claims and litigation in which we are currently involved, see Part I Item 3. Legal Proceedings above. Our business, our products and our distribution are subject to increasing regulation of content, consumer privacy and online delivery in the key territories in which we conduct business. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our business may suffer. Legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution. For example, privacy laws in the United States and Europe impose various restrictions on our web sites. Those rules vary by territory although the Internet recognizes no geographical boundaries. Other countries, such as Germany, have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged goods and those transmitted over the Internet that are stricter than current United States laws. In the United States, the federal and several state governments are considering content restrictions on products such as ours, as well as restrictions on distribution of such products. Any one or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers and by requiring additional differentiation between products for different territories to address varying regulations. This additional product differentiation would be costly. If we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel, we will be unable to effectively conduct our business. In addition, compensation related changes in accounting requirements, in addition to evolving legal and operational factors, could have a significant impact on our expenses and operating results. The market for technical, creative, marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive. Our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent. If we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need, or replace key employees following their departure, our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired. We annually review and evaluate with the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors the compensation and benefits that we offer our employees to ensure that we are able to attract and retain our talent. Within our regular review, we have considered recent changes in the accounting treatment of stock options, the competitive market for technical, creative, marketing and other personnel, and the evolving nature of job functions within our studios, marketing organizations and other areas of the business. Any changes we make to our compensation programs could result in increased expenses and have a significant impact on our operating results. Our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of and or access to our video game products. If they do not approve our products, we will be unable to ship to our customers. Our agreements with hardware licensors (such as Sony for the PlayStation 2, Microsoft for the Xbox and Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube) typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products, which could, in certain circumstances, leave us unable to get our products approved, manufactured and shipped to customers. These hardware licensors are also our chief competitors. In most events, control of the approval and manufacturing process by the platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently. While we believe that our relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good, the potential for these licensors to delay or refuse to approve or manufacture our products exists. Such occurrences would harm our business and our financial performance. We also require compatibility code and the consent of Microsoft and Sony in order to include online capabilities in our products for their respective platforms. As online capabilities for video game platforms 52 Table of Contents become more significant, Microsoft and Sony could restrict our ability to provide online capabilities for our console platform products. If Microsoft or Sony refused to approve our products with online capabilities or significantly impacted the financial terms on which these services are offered to our customers, our business could be harmed. Our international net revenue is subject to currency fluctuations. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, international net revenue comprised 47 percent of our total net revenue. We expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue. Such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers. Additionally, foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies, which may fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. While we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities (primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables) and from time to time, foreign currency option contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions (primarily related to a portion of the revenue generated by our operational subsidiaries), our results of operations, including our reported net revenue and net income, and financial condition would be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the Euro and Pound Sterling. Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are also required to estimate what our taxes will be in the future. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the estimate process is inherently uncertain, and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in our business, including the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the elections we make, changes in applicable tax laws as well as other factors. Further, our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision. Should our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates, our income tax provision and net income could be materially affected. We are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these non income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations, changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Changes in our worldwide operating structure could have adverse tax consequences. We are in the process of examining our worldwide operating structure in light of changing tax laws, our current and anticipated business operations, and the pending expiration of an offshore advance pricing agreements with a foreign tax authority in December 2005 under which our current business operates. Certain changes that we are considering, or a failure to make certain other changes, to our operating structure would increase our tax expense. In addition, while our current intention is to invest indefinitely our undistributed foreign earnings offshore, we are in the process of evaluating whether we will change our intentions regarding a portion of our foreign earnings and take advantage of the repatriation provision of the Jobs Act, and if so, the amount that we would intend to repatriate. We may decide not to take advantage of the new law at all. In addition to not having made a decision to repatriate any foreign earnings, we are not yet in a position to determine the impact of a qualifying repatriation, should we choose to make one, on our income tax expense for fiscal 2006. 53 Table of Contents Our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves. As a result of the enactment of the Sarbanes Oxley Act and the review of accounting policies by the SEC and national and international accounting standards bodies, the frequency of accounting policy changes may accelerate. For example, the FASB has issued a new standard that will require us to adopt a different method of determining and accounting for the compensation expense of our employee stock options. This and other possible changes to accounting standards, could adversely affect our reported results of operations although not necessarily our cash flows. Further, accounting policies affecting software revenue recognition have been the subject of frequent interpretations, which could significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products. As we enhance, expand and diversify our business and product offerings, the application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue, could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows. The majority of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key customers. If these customers reduce their purchases of our products or become unable to pay for them, our business could be harmed. In the U.S., in fiscal 2005, over 80 percent of our U.S. sales were made to six key customers, two of which have recently announced plans to merge. In Europe, our top ten customers accounted for over 30 percent of our sales in that territory in fiscal 2005. Worldwide, we had direct sales to one customer, Wal Mart Stores, Inc., which represented 14 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2005. Though our products are available to consumers through a variety of retailers, the concentration of our sales in one, or a few, large customers could lead to a short term disruption in our sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products, and could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products. Additionally, our receivables from these large customers increase significantly in the December quarter as they stock up for the holiday selling season. Also, having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers reduces our negotiating leverage with these customers. Acquisitions, investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties, dilution to our investors and other negative consequences. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including (1) acquisitions of companies, businesses, intellectual properties, and other assets, and (2) investments in new interactive entertainment businesses (for example, online and mobile games). Any of these strategic transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. Although we regularly search for opportunities to engage in strategic transactions, we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities. We may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or investments or an acquisition or investment may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired company or business, or successfully exploiting acquired intellectual property or other assets, could divert a significant amount of our managements time and focus and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Additional risks we face include: The need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that, prior to the acquisition, lacked these controls, procedures and policies, Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization, Retaining key employees from the businesses we acquire, The need to integrate an acquired companys accounting, management information, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and To the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside of the United States, we face additional risks, including risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. 54 Table of Contents Future acquisitions and investments could involve the issuance of our equity securities, potentially diluting our existing stockholders, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review, vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments. Our products are subject to the threat of piracy by a variety of organizations and individuals. If we are not successful in combating and preventing piracy, our sales and profitability could be harmed significantly. In many countries around the world, more pirated copies of our products are sold than legitimate copies. Though piracy has not had a material impact on our operating results to date, highly organized pirate operations have been expanding globally. In addition, the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures we use in our products, the availability of broadband access to the Internet, the ability to download pirated copies of our games from various Internet sites, and the widespread proliferation of Internet cafes using pirated copies of our products, all have contributed to ongoing and expanding piracy. Though we take steps to make the unauthorized copying and distribution of our products more difficult, as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our games are played, neither our efforts nor those of the console manufacturers may be successful in controlling the piracy of our products. This could have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future. Our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The market price of our common stock historically has been, and we expect will continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations. These fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us (including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material), to changes in securities analysts earnings estimates, to our results falling below the expectations of analysts and investors, to factors affecting the computer, software, Internet, entertainment, media or electronics industries, or to national or international economic conditions. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market prices. Market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices. Foreign currency option and foreign exchange forward contracts are used to either hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to market risk. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Interest rate risk is the potential loss arising from changes in interest rates and credit ratings. We do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be exposed to significant interest rate risk because our portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk From time to time, we hedge some of our foreign currency risk related to anticipated foreign currency denominated sales transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have maturities of 15 months or less. These transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of any tax effects, in stockholders equity and subsequently reclassified into net revenue in the period when the forecasted transaction actually occurs. The ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value is reported in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not entirely 55 Table of Contents eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. The fair value of our foreign currency option contracts purchased and included in other current assets was $1 million as of both March 31, 2005 and 2004. We utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, primarily intercompany receivables and payables. The forward contracts generally have a contractual term of less than one month and are transacted near month end. Therefore, the fair value of the forward contracts generally is not significant at each month end. Our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133 and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts are reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and gains and losses from changes in fair value are reported in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. As of March 31, 2005 we had foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately $425 million of foreign currencies. Of this amount, $379 million represents contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars, $22 million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for British Pounds, and $24 million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for U.S. dollars. As of March 31, 2004 we had foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately $190 million of foreign currencies. Of this amount, $173 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars and $17 million to sell foreign currency for British Pounds. The fair value of our forward contracts was approximately $0 and $2 million as of March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The counterparties to these forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks. The risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material. Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks, there can be no assurances that our mitigating activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. For example, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would not result in a material loss in fair value of our option contracts under either scenario as of March 31, 2005 or 2004. A hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would result in potential losses on our forward contracts of $40 million and $61 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2005, and $17 million and $26 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2004. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift in foreign currency exchange rates, which do not always move in the same direction. Actual results may differ materially. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio. We manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities. Additionally, the contractual terms of the securities do not permit the issuer to call, prepay or otherwise settle the securities at prices less that the stated par value of the securities. We also do not use derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio. As of March 31, 2005 and 2004, our short term investments were classified as available for sale and, consequently, recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of any tax effects, 56 Table of Contents in stockholders equity. Our portfolio of short term investments consists of the following investment categories, summarized by fair value as of March 31, 2005 and 2004 (in millions): As of March 31, 2005 2004 U.S. government agencies $ 1,168 $ 264 U.S. government bonds 298 Corporate bonds 180 Asset backed securities 42 Total short term investments $ 1,688 $ 264 Notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks, there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a significant adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. The following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our short term investment portfolio as of March 31, 2005, arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. The modeling technique measures the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS. Actual results may differ materially.

Therefore, we have changed our quantitative disclosures of interest rate risk from the tabular presentation used in prior years to the sensitivity analysis, presented above, as we believe this methodology better illustrates the effects on our portfolio caused by our primary risk of changes in interest rates. We have not presented a similar sensitivity analysis for fiscal 2004 because of the relatively insignificant amount of short term investments in fiscal 2004 versus fiscal 2005. Market Price Risk The values of our equity investments in publicly traded companies are subject to market price volatility. As of March 31, 2005, our marketable equity securities were classified as available for sale and, consequently, were recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of any tax effects, in stockholders equity. The fair value of our marketable equity securities was $140 million and $1 million as of March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 57 Table of Contents At any time, a sharp decrease in market prices in our investments in marketable equity securities could have a significant adverse impact on the fair value of our investments. The following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our marketable equity securities as of March 31, 2005, arising from selected potential changes in market prices. The modeling technique measures the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in market price plus or minus 25 percent, 50 percent and 75 percent. Hypothetical changes in market prices of the same magnitude would not have resulted in material changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities as of March 31, 2004 and, accordingly, are not presented.
