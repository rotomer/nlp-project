Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW The following overview is a top level discussion of our operating results, as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business. Management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, as well as our future prospects. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Form 10 K, including in the Business section and the Risk Factors above, the remainder of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. About Electronic Arts We develop, market, publish and distribute video game software and content that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms, including video game consoles (such as the PLAYSTATION&reg; 3, Microsoft Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii), personal computers, handheld game players (such as the PlayStation&reg; Portable (PSP) and the Nintendo DS) and mobile devices (such as cellular phones and smart phones including the Apple iPhone). Some of our games are based on content that we license from others (e.g., FIFA Soccer, Madden NFL Football, Harry Potter, and Hasbros toy and game intellectual properties), and some of our games are based on our own wholly owned intellectual property (e.g., The Sims, Need for Speed, and Dead Space). Our goal is to publish titles with global mass market appeal, which often means translating and localizing them for sale in non English speaking countries. In addition, we also attempt to create software game franchises that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property. Examples of this franchise approach are the annual iterations of our sports based products (e.g., FIFA Soccer, Madden NFL Football, and NCAA&reg; Football), wholly owned properties that can be successfully sequeled (e.g., The Sims, Need for Speed and Battlefield) and titles based on long lived literary and or movie properties (e.g., Harry Potter). Financial Results Total net revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 was $3,654 million, down $558 million as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. At March 31, 2010, deferred net revenue associated with sales of online enabled packaged goods and digital content increased by $505 million as compared to March 31, 2009, directly reducing the amount of reported net revenue during the year ended March 31, 2010. At March 31, 2009, deferred net revenue associated with sales of online enabled packaged goods and digital content decreased by $126 million as compared to March 31, 2008, directly increasing the amount of reported net revenue during the year ended March 31, 2009. Without these changes in deferred net revenue, reported net revenue increased by approximately $73 million during fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009. Net revenue for fiscal year 2010 was driven by FIFA 10, Madden NFL 10 and The Sims 3. Net loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 was $677 million as compared to a net loss of $1,088 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 was $2.08 as compared to a diluted loss per share of $3.40 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Net loss decreased for fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 primarily as a result of (1) the recognition of $368 million of goodwill impairment during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, (2) a $262 million decrease in our income tax provision primarily due to the discrete tax charge to establish the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in 2009, (3) a $261 million decrease in cost of goods sold, and (4) a $130 million decrease in research and development costs. These decreases were partially offset by (1) a decrease of $558 million in net revenue and (2) a $60 million increase in restructuring charges primarily from our fiscal 2010 restructuring. During fiscal year 2010, we generated $152 million of cash from operating activities as compared to generating $12 million for fiscal year 2009. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to decreases in personnel related costs and external development and contracted services as part of our cost reduction initiatives, as well as a reduction in incentive based compensation payments. 30 Table of Contents Trends in Our Business Economic Environment. Overall consumer spending has declined as a result of the national and global economic downturn. Retailers globally continue to take a conservative stance in ordering game inventory. We believe that the continued decline in the packaged goods sector contributed to the lower than anticipated demand for our products during the 2009 holiday selling season. We remain cautious about our future sales in light of the economic environment and the impact it has had on our business. Current Generation Game Consoles. Video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle of four to six years, which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well. The current cycle began with Microsofts launch of the Xbox 360 in 2005, and continued in 2006 when Sony and Nintendo launched their next generation systems, the PLAYSTATION 3 and the Wii, respectively. Unlike past cycles, we believe this current cycle may be extended, partly due to the growth of online gaming services and content, the greater graphic and processing power of the current generation hardware and the introduction of new peripherals. However, growth in the installed base of users of the Xbox 360, the PLAYSTATION 3 and the Wii may slow down in light of the economic environment. Consequently, our industry may experience a decline. Wireless Platforms. Advances in wireless technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving platforms for on the go interactive entertainment that appeal to a broad consumer base. Our efforts in wireless interactive entertainment are focused in two areas packaged goods games for handheld game systems and downloadable games for mobile devices. We expect sales of games for mobile devices to continue to be an important part of our business worldwide. Catalog Sales. The video game industry is experiencing a change in retail sales patterns which is decreasing revenue from our catalog sales. Currently, many console games experience sales cycles that are shorter than in the past. To mitigate this trend, we offer our consumers a direct to consumer service (such as head to head play or other multiplayer options) and or additional content available through our online service to further enhance the gaming experience and extend the time that consumers play our games after their initial purchase. Used Games. Certain of our customers sell used video games, which are generally priced lower than new video games and do not result in revenue to the publisher of the games from the sale. We have seen the market for used video games grow. If our customers continue to increase their sales of used video games, it could negatively affect our sales of new video games and have an adverse impact on our operating results. Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Games. We see a larger portion of packaged goods games sales concentrated on the most popular titles, and that those titles are typically sequels of prior games. We have reacted to this trend by significantly reducing the number of games that we produce to provide greater focus on our most promising intellectual properties. Digital Content Distribution and Services. Consumers are spending an ever increasing portion of their money and time on interactive entertainment that is accessible online, or through mobile digital devices such as smart phones, or through social networks such as Facebook and MySpace. We provide a variety of online delivered products and services. Many of our games that are available as packaged good products are also available through direct online download through the Internet (from websites we maintain and others that we license). We also offer online delivered content and services that are add ons or related to our packaged goods products such as additional game content or enhancements of multiplayer services. Further, we provide other games, content and services that are available only via electronic delivery, such as Internet only games and game services, and games for mobile devices. Advances in mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving devices that are being used to play games by an ever broadening base of consumers. We have responded to these advances in technology, and consumer acceptance of digital distribution, by offering subscription services, online downloads for a one time fee, and advertising supported free games and game sites. We expect online delivery of games and game services to be an increasing part of our business going forward. 31 Table of Contents Recent Developments Acquisition of Playfish Limited. On November 9, 2009, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Playfish Limited (Playfish) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $308 million in cash and equity. In addition, we may be required to pay additional variable cash consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance milestones through December 31, 2011. This additional consideration is limited to a maximum of $100 million. Playfish is a developer of free to play social games that can be played on social networking platforms. Fiscal 2010 Restructuring Plan. In fiscal year 2010, we announced details of a restructuring plan. This plan includes a narrowing of our product portfolio to provide greater focus on titles with higher margin opportunities. Under this plan, we reduced our workforce by approximately 1,200 employees and have been (1) consolidating or closing various facilities, (2) eliminating certain titles, and (3) incurring IT and other costs to assist in reorganizing certain activities. The majority of these actions were completed by March 31, 2010. Since the inception of this plan through March 31, 2010, we have incurred charges of approximately $116 million. Overall, including charges incurred through March 31, 2010, we expect to incur total cash and non cash charges between $140 million and $145 million by March 31, 2012. These charges consist primarily of (1) employee related costs (approximately $65 million), (2) intangible asset impairment costs, abandoned rights to intellectual property costs, and other costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions (approximately $35 million), (3) facilities exit costs (approximately $25 million), and (4) other reorganizational costs including IT and consulting costs (approximately $20 million). Employee Stock Option Exchange Program. On October 21, 2009, we launched a voluntary Employee Stock Option Exchange Program (Exchange Program) to permit our eligible employees to exchange outstanding eligible options for a lesser number of restricted stock units, shares of restricted stock (in Canada only), or new options (in China only) to be granted under our 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (the Equity Plan). The Exchange Program offer period began on October 21, 2009 and ended on November 18, 2009. Options eligible for the Exchange Program were those options granted prior to October 21, 2008, that had an exercise price per share greater than $28.18, which was the 52 week high trading price of our common stock measured as of the start date of the Exchange Program, as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, and that upon conversion using the exchange ratio applicable for such options resulted in four or more shares of restricted stock units, shares of restricted stock or new options, as the case may be. The Exchange Program resulted in options to purchase approximately 16,561,000 shares of our common stock being exchanged for restricted stock units to acquire approximately 4,996,000 shares, approximately 923,000 shares of restricted stock awards and new options to purchase approximately 18,000 shares. Due to the structure of the Exchange Program as a value for value exchange for the eligible options tendered for exchange, and certain assumptions we are required to use regarding the eligible options for accounting purposes, we will recognize an incremental accounting charge of approximately $70 million over the vesting period of the restricted stock units, restricted stock and options issued in the Exchange Program in addition to recognizing any remaining unrecognized expense for the stock options surrendered in the exchange. International Operations and Foreign Currency Exchange Impact. International sales (i.e., revenue derived from countries other than Canada and the United States), are a fundamental part of our business. Net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately 45 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2010 and approximately 43 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2009. We believe that in order to succeed internationally, it is important to locally develop content that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs. Year over year, we estimate that foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our net revenue of approximately $107 million, or 3 percent, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, the U.S. dollar strengthened against other currencies, including the Euro and the British pound sterling. In addition, our international investments and our cash and cash equivalents 32 Table of Contents denominated in foreign currencies are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against these currencies, then foreign exchange rates may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations and our financial condition. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown. As a result, actual results may differ materially from our estimates. Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns, Allowances and Bad Debt Reserves We derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles (such as the PLAYSTATION 3, Xbox 360 and Wii), PCs, handheld game players (such as the PSP and Nintendo DS), and mobile devices (such as cellular phones and smart phones including the Apple iPhone). We evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 985 605, Software: Revenue Recognition, and Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. We evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met: Evidence of an arrangement. Evidence of an agreement with the customer that reflects the terms and conditions to deliver products that must be present in order to recognize revenue. Delivery. Delivery is considered to occur when a product is shipped and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer. For online game services, delivery is considered to occur as the service is provided. For digital downloads that do not have an online service component, delivery is generally considered to occur when the download is made available. Fixed or determinable fee. If a portion of the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue as the amount becomes fixed or determinable. Collection is deemed probable. We conduct a credit review of each customer involved in a significant transaction to determine the creditworthiness of the customer. Collection is deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due. If we determine that collection is not probable, we recognize revenue when collection becomes probable (generally upon cash collection). Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and management judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report in each period. For example, for multiple element arrangements, we must make assumptions and judgments in order to (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered, (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services, (3) determine whether VSOE exists for each undelivered element, and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver. Changes to any of these assumptions or management judgments, or changes to the elements in a software arrangement, could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Depending on the type of product, we may offer an online service that permits consumers to play against others via the Internet and or receive additional updates or content from us. For those games that consumers can play via the Internet, we may provide a matchmaking service that permits consumers to connect with other consumers to play against each other online. In those situations where we do not require an additional fee for this 33 Table of Contents online service, we account for the sale of the software product and the online service as a bundled sale, or multiple element arrangement, in which we sell both the software product and the online service for one combined price. We defer net revenue from sales of these games for which we do not have VSOE for the online service that we provided in connection with the sale, and recognize the revenue from these games over the estimated online service period, which is generally estimated to be six months beginning in the month after shipment. In addition, for some software products we also provide updates or additional content (digital content) to be delivered via the Internet that can be used with the original software product. In many cases we separately sell digital content for an additional fee; however, some purchased digital content can only be accessed via the Internet (i.e., the consumer never takes possession of the digital content). We account for online transactions in which the consumer does not take possession of the digital content as a service transaction and, accordingly, we recognize the associated revenue over the estimated service period. In other transactions, at the date we sell the software product we have an obligation to provide incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee. In these cases, we account for the sale of the software product as a multiple element arrangement and recognize the revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated period of game play. Determining whether a transaction constitutes an online service transaction or a digital content download of a product requires judgment and can be difficult. The accounting for these transactions is significantly different. Revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available (assuming all other recognition criteria are met). Revenue from an online game service is recognized as the service is rendered. If the service period is not defined, we recognize the revenue over the estimated service period. Determining the estimated service period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage. In addition, determining whether we have an implicit obligation to provide incremental unspecified future digital content without an additional fee can be difficult. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors (channel partners), is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce product revenue for estimated future returns, price protection, and other offerings, which may occur with our customers and channel partners. Price protection represents the right to receive a credit allowance in the event we lower our wholesale price on a particular product. The amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old price and the new price. In certain countries, we have stock balancing programs for our PC and video game system software products, which allow for the exchange of these software products by resellers under certain circumstances. It is our general practice to exchange software products or give credits rather than to give cash refunds. In certain countries, from time to time, we decide to provide price protection for our software products. When evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances, we analyze historical returns, current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our software products, current trends in retail and the video game segment, changes in customer demand and acceptance of our software products, and other related factors. In addition, we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories, as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods. In the future, actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing software products. For example, the risk of product returns and or price protection for our software products may continue to increase as the PlayStation 2 console moves through its lifecycle. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates changed, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report. For example, if actual returns and or price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established, our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue. Conversely, if actual returns and or price protection were significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our reported total net revenue. In addition, if our estimates of returns and price protection related to online enabled packaged goods software products change, the amount of deferred net revenue we recognize in the future would change. 34 Table of Contents Significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period. We determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and historical experience. Depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers, the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly. Fair Value Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item in order to fairly present our financial statements. Without an independent market or another representative transaction, determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion on the appropriate accounting. There are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value. These include (1) the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value, (2) the income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, future cash flows or future earnings) to a single present value amount, and (3) the cost approach, which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset. For many of our fair value estimates, including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets and acquired in process technology, we use the income approach. Using the income approach requires the use of financial models, which require us to make various estimates including, but not limited to (1) the potential future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured, (2) the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows, (3) the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows, and (4) the inherent risk associated with the cash flows (risk premium). Making these cash flow estimates are inherently difficult and subjective, and, if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate, our financial results may be negatively impacted. Furthermore, relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached. For example, a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired. While we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions, the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments: Business Combinations. We must estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities and contingencies assumed, acquired in process technology, and contingent consideration issued in a business combination. Our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets and acquired in process technology are amortized over various estimated useful lives. Furthermore, a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill, an asset that is not amortized. Determining the fair value of assets acquired requires an assessment of the highest and best use or the expected price to sell the asset and the related expected future cash flows. Determining the fair value of acquired in process technology also requires an assessment of our expectations related to the use of that asset. Determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to transfer the liability. Determining the fair value of contingent consideration issued requires an assessment of the expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled, and applying a discount rate that appropriately captures a market participants view of the risk associated with the obligation. This fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination. Such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Assessment of Impairment of Goodwill, Intangibles, and Other Long Lived Assets. Current accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability of our finite lived acquisition related intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the remaining value of the assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is potentially impaired. In order to determine if a potential 35 Table of Contents impairment has occurred, management must make various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows. For some assets, our estimated fair value is dependent upon predicting which of our products will be successful. This success is dependent upon several factors, which are beyond our control, such as which operating platforms will be successful in the marketplace. Also, our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules. We are required to perform a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. Our reporting units are determined by the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which (1) discrete financial information is available and (2) segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We are required to perform the impairment test at least annually by applying a fair value based test. The first step measures for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the reporting unit level. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. To determine the fair value of each reporting unit used in the first step, we use a combination of the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies data, and or the income approach, which utilizes discounted cash flows. Each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include long term growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. These estimates and assumptions have to be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment. Our estimates for market growth, our market share and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Our business consists of developing, marketing and distributing video game software using both established and emerging intellectual properties and our forecasts for emerging intellectual properties are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information and have an inherently higher risk of accuracy. If future forecasts are revised, they may indicate or require future impairment charges. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. Assessment of Impairment of Short Term Investments, Marketable Equity Securities and Other Investments. We periodically review our short term investments, marketable equity securities and other investments for impairment. Our short term investments consist of securities with remaining maturities greater than three months at the time of purchase and our marketable equity securities consist of investments in common stock of publicly traded companies, both are accounted for as available for sale securities. Unrealized gains and losses on our short term investments and marketable equity securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity, net of tax, until either (1) the security is sold or (2) we determine that the fair value of the security has declined below its adjusted cost basis and the decline is other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on our short term investments and marketable equity securities are calculated based on the specific identification method and are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income, net, and losses on strategic investments, net, respectively. Determining whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each security. The ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the credit quality of the issuer, the duration that the fair value has been less than the adjusted cost basis, severity of the impairment, reason for the decline in value and potential recovery period, the financial condition and near term prospects of the investees, and our intent to sell and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, any contractual terms impacting the prepayment or settlement process, as well as, if we would be required to sell an investment due to liquidity or contractual reasons before its anticipated recovery. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized impairment charges of $26 million, $57 million, and $109 million, respectively, on our marketable equity securities. Our ongoing consideration of these factors could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could have a material impact on our financial results. 36 Table of Contents Our other investments consist principally of non voting preferred shares in two companies whose common stock is publicly traded and are accounted for under the cost method. Under this method, these investments are recorded at cost until we determine that the fair value of the investment has fallen below its adjusted cost basis and that such declines are other than temporary. We monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in the carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near term prospects of the investees. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, we recognized impairment charges of $10 million, and $9 million, respectively, on our other investments. We did not recognize any impairment charges in fiscal year 2010 on our other investments. Assessment of Inventory Obsolescence. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand. We write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products. Inventory write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value, based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess. At the point of a loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Stock Based Compensation We are required to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant. We recognize compensation costs for stock based payment transactions to employees based on their grant date fair value on a straight line approach over the service period for which such awards are expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock is determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and our 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), respectively, is determined using the Black Scholes valuation model. The determination of fair value is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award. Generally, our assumptions are based on historical information and judgment is required to determine if historical trends may be indicators of future outcomes. The key assumptions for the Black Scholes valuation calculation are: Risk free interest rate. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option. Expected volatility. We use a combination of historical stock price volatility and implied volatility computed based on the price of options publicly traded on our common stock for our expected volatility assumption. Expected term. The expected term represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. The expected term is determined based on historical exercise behavior, post vesting termination patterns, options outstanding and future expected exercise behavior. Expected dividends. Employee stock based compensation expense is calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and an adjustment to stock based compensation expense will be recognized at that time. Changes to our underlying stock price, our assumptions used in the Black Scholes option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rate, as well as future equity granted or assumed through acquisitions could significantly impact the compensation expense we recognize. Royalties and Licenses Our royalty expenses consist of payments to (1) content licensors, (2) independent software developers, and (3) co publishing and distribution affiliates. License royalties consist of payments made to celebrities, 37 Table of Contents professional sports organizations, movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks, copyrights, personal publicity rights, content and or other intellectual property. Royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games. Co publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products. Royalty based obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid. These royalty based obligations are generally expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue. Significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract. Because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue, it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors, including (1) the total number of titles subject to the contract, (2) the timing of the release of these titles, (3) the number of software units we expect to sell, which can be impacted by a number of variables, including product quality, the timing of the titles release and competition, and (4) future pricing. Determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products. Accordingly, if our future revenue projections change, our effective royalty rates would change, which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize. Prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and co publishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and, therefore, we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product. Accordingly, payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred. Payments due after completion of the product (primarily royalty based in nature) are generally expensed as cost of goods sold. Our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments, which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor. When performance remains with the licensor, we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred, rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract. These obligations are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next twelve months. As of March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2009, approximately $13 million and $37 million, respectively, of minimum guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized. Each quarter, we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royalty based assets, as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales. Any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense. Impairments or losses determined post launch are charged to cost of goods sold. We evaluate long lived royalty based assets for impairment using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist. Unrecognized minimum royalty based commitments are accounted for as executory contracts and, therefore, any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned (i.e., cease use) or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated. During fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized impairment charges of $10 million, loss charges of $43 million and loss and impairment charges of $4 million, respectively. The $10 million impairment charge recognized during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, was primarily related to our fiscal 2010 restructuring. This impairment is included in restructuring charges presented in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The loss charges in fiscal year 2009 primarily related to an amendment of a licensor agreement in which we terminated certain rights we previously had to use the licensors intellectual property. Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carry forwards. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it 38 Table of Contents is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified. It is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. Forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results, particularly in light of the recent deterioration of the economic environment. Therefore, cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment. In addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income, we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets, namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, the carry back of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. Evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments. Each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence; this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity. Certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets. For example, in determining the valuation allowance we recorded at June 30, 2009, we did not include as a source of future taxable income the taxable temporary difference related to the accumulated tax depreciation on our headquarters facilities in Redwood City, California. On July 13, 2009, we purchased our Redwood Shores headquarters facilities concurrent with the expiration and extinguishment of the lessors financing agreements. These facilities were subject to lease obligations to non affiliated parties which expired in July 2009, and had been accounted for as operating leases. The total amount paid under the terms of the leases was $247 million, of which $233 million related to the purchase price of the facilities and $14 million was for the loss on our lease obligation. Therefore, in the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2009, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $31 million, consisting of approximately $6 million related to the loss on our lease obligation and a $25 million reduction in our valuation allowance due to the inclusion of a significant portion of the remaining taxable temporary difference as a source of future taxable income. Based on the assumptions and requirements noted above, we have recorded a valuation allowance against most of our U.S. deferred tax assets. In addition, we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future U.S. tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods. This process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate. These estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation, as well as with respect to other matters, such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities. The ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations. In addition, changes in our business, including acquisitions, changes in our international corporate structure, changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in the geographic mix and amount of income, as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities, valuation allowances, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other matters, and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate. We historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States and, accordingly, no U.S. taxes have been provided thereon. We currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the United States. 39 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our fiscal year is reported on a 52 or 53 week period that ends on the Saturday nearest March 31. Our results of operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 contained 53 weeks and ended on April 3, 2010. Our results of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 contained 52 weeks and ended on March 28, 2009 and March 29, 2008, respectively. For simplicity of disclosure, all fiscal periods are referred to as ending on a calendar month end. Comparison of Fiscal 2010 to Fiscal 2009 Net Revenue Net revenue consists of sales generated from (1) video games sold as packaged goods and designed for play on hardware consoles (such as the PLAYSTATION 3, Xbox 360 and Wii), PCs, and handheld game players (such as the Sony PSP and Nintendo DS), (2) video games for mobile devices (such as cellular phones and smart phones including the Apple iPhone), (3) digitally downloaded games and content and online services associated with these games, (4) services in connection with some of our online enabled games, (5) programming third party web sites with our game content, (6) allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products, and (7) advertisements on our online web pages and in our games. Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral, a non GAAP financial measure, is provided in this section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A). See Non GAAP Financial Measures below for an explanation of our use of this non GAAP measure. A reconciliation to the corresponding measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States is provided in the discussion below. Revenue Deferral in this Net Revenue section, includes the unrecognized revenue from (1) bundled sales of certain online enabled packaged goods and PC digital downloads for which either we do not have VSOE for the online service that we provide in connection with the sale of the software or we have an obligation to provide future incremental unspecified digital content, (2) certain packaged goods sales of massively multiplayer online role playing games, and (3) sales of certain incremental digital content associated with our games, which are types of micro transactions. Fluctuations in the Revenue Deferral are largely dependent upon the amounts of products that we sell with the online features and services previously discussed, while the recognition of Revenue Deferral for a period is also dependent upon (1) the period of time the online features and services are to be provided and (2) the timing of the sale. For example, most Revenue Deferrals incurred in the first half of a fiscal year are recognized within the same fiscal year; however, virtually all of the Revenue Deferrals incurred in the last month of a fiscal year will be recognized in the subsequent fiscal year. From a geographical perspective, our total Net Revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 was as follows (in millions): Year Ended March 31, 2010 2009 NorthAmerica Europe Asia Total NorthAmerica Europe Asia Total Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral $ 2,322 $ 1,615 $ 222 $ 4,159 $ 2,362 $ 1,521 $ 203 $ 4,086 Revenue Deferral (1,255 ) (981 ) (122 ) (2,358 ) (538 ) (472 ) (67 ) (1,077 ) Recognition of Revenue Deferral 958 799 96 1,853 588 540 75 1,203 Net Revenue $ 2,025 $ 1,433 $ 196 $ 3,654 $ 2,412 $ 1,589 $ 211 $ 4,212 For fiscal year 2010, Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral was $4,159 million, driven by FIFA 10, Madden NFL 10, and The Sims 3. Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral for fiscal year 2010 increased $73 million, or 2 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2009. From an operational perspective, this increase was primarily driven by 40 Table of Contents (1) $149 million from sales of Dragon Age which was released in 2010 with no comparable release in 2009, (2) a $137 million increase from sales of The Sims, and (3) $131 million from sales of EA SPORTS Active, which was released in 2010 with no comparable release in 2009. These increases were partially offset by a $329 million decrease from sales of Rock Band. Revenue Deferral for fiscal year 2010 increased $1,281 million, or 119 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2009. Starting in fiscal year 2010, we began to sell substantially all of our online enabled products released after April 1, 2009, with an obligation to provide future incremental unspecified digital content on a when and if available basis. As we do not have VSOE for this obligation, we are required to recognize the revenue associated with this bundled sale over the expected life of the game. From an operational perspective, this increase was primarily driven by (1) a $263 million increase from sales of The Sims, (2) a $174 million increase from sales of FIFA Soccer, (3) a $171 million increase from sales of Battlefield, and (4) $150 million from sales of Dragon Age. The Recognition of Revenue Deferral for fiscal year 2010 increased $650 million, or 54 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2009. This increase is directly related to the increase in the Revenue Deferral in fiscal year 2010.

Net Revenue for fiscal year 2010 decreased $558 million, or 13 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2009. From an operational perspective, this decrease was primarily driven by (1) a $329 million decrease from sales of Rock Band and (2) an $84 million decrease from sales of Battlefield primarily due to a larger amount being deferred because of our obligation to provide future incremental unspecified digital content that did not exist in fiscal year 2009. These decreases were partially offset by (1) $131 million from sales of EA SPORTS Active and (2) an $89 million increase from sales of The Sims. North America For fiscal year 2010, Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral in North America was $2,322 million, driven by Madden NFL 10, The Beatles:Rock Band, and Battlefield: Bad Company 2. Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral for fiscal year 2010 decreased $40 million, or 2 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2009. From an operational perspective, this decrease was primarily driven by a $293 million decrease from sales of Rock Band. This decrease was partially offset by (1) $90 million from sales of EA SPORTS Active, (2) $89 million from sales of Dragon Age, and (3) a $62 million increase from sales of The Sims. Revenue Deferral for fiscal year 2010 increased $717 million, or 133 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2009.

Europe For fiscal year 2010, Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral in Europe was $1,615 million, driven by FIFA 10, The Sims 3, and Need for Speed Shift. Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral for fiscal year 2010 increased $94 million, or 6 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2009. From an operational perspective, this increase was primarily driven by (1) a $68 million increase from sales of The Sims, (2) a $64 million increase from sales of FIFA Soccer, and (3) $53 million from sales of Dragon Age. These increases were partially offset by (1) a $39 million decrease from sales of Rock Band and (2) a $36 million decrease from sales of Spore. We estimate that 41 Table of Contents foreign exchange rates (primarily the British pound sterling) decreased reported Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral by approximately $44 million, or 3 percent, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates from Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral, we estimate that Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral increased by approximately $138 million, or 9 percent, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Revenue Deferral for fiscal year 2010 increased by $509 million, or 108 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2009.

Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates from Net Revenue, we estimate that net revenue decreased by approximately $40 million, or 3 percent, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Asia For fiscal year 2010, Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral in Asia was $222 million, driven by FIFA 10, Battlefield: Bad Company 2, and The Sims 3. Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral for fiscal year 2010 increased by $19 million, or 9 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2009. From an operational perspective, this increase was primarily driven by (1) a $8 million increase from sales of FIFA Soccer, (2) $8 million from sales of EA SPORTS Active, and (3) $7 million from sales of Dragon Age. These increases were partially offset by a $5 million decrease from sales of Mercenaries. We estimate that foreign exchange rates (primarily the Australian dollar) increased reported Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral by approximately $8 million, or 4 percent, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009.

We defer Net Revenue from sales of certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content for which we are not able to objectively determine the fair value (as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for software sales) of the online service that we provided in connection with the sale. We recognize the revenue from these games over the estimated online service period. We also defer Net Revenue from sales of certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content for which we had an obligation to deliver incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee. We recognize the revenue for these games on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the game. We believe that excluding the impact of Revenue Deferral and the Recognition of Revenue Deferral related to packaged goods games and digital content from our operating results is important to facilitate comparisons between years in understanding our underlying sales performance for the period. We use this non GAAP measure internally to evaluate our operating performance, when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, and when assessing the performance of our management team. While we believe that this non GAAP financial measure is useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non GAAP financial measure may not be the same as non GAAP measures presented by other companies. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold for our packaged goods business consists of (1) product costs, (2) certain royalty expenses for celebrities, professional sports and other organizations and independent software developers, (3) manufacturing royalties, net of volume discounts and other vendor reimbursements, (4) expenses for defective products, (5) write offs of post launch prepaid royalty costs, (6) amortization of certain intangible assets, (7) personnel related costs, and (8) warehousing and distribution costs. We generally recognize volume discounts when they are earned from the manufacturer (typically in connection with the achievement of unit based milestones), whereas other vendor reimbursements are generally recognized as the related revenue is recognized. Cost of goods sold for our online products consists primarily of data center and bandwidth costs associated with hosting our web sites, credit card fees and royalties for use of third party properties. Cost of goods sold for our web site advertising business primarily consists of server costs. Cost of goods sold for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue % Change Change as a% of NetRevenue $1,866 51.1% $2,127 50.5% (12.3%) 0.6% During fiscal year 2010, cost of goods sold increased by 0.6 percent as a percentage of total net revenue as compared to fiscal year 2009. This increase was primarily due to a $631 million increase in deferred net revenue related to certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content for the twelve months ended March 31, 2010, as compared to the twelve months ended March 31, 2009. Overall, we estimate the increase in deferred net revenue related to certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content negatively impacted cost of goods sold as a percent of total net revenue by 7.7 percentage points. The overall increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was partially mitigated by (1) a greater percentage of net revenue from EA studio products, which have a higher margin than our co publishing and distribution products, which positively impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenue by approximately 3.1 percent and (2) EA Studio products that we sold which had previously been written down to a lower costs basis and lower inventory write downs on our fiscal year 2010 releases as compared to our fiscal year 2009 releases, which positively impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenue by approximately 2.1 percent. 43 Table of Contents Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expenses consist of personnel related costs, related overhead costs and advertising, marketing and promotional expenses, net of qualified advertising cost reimbursements from third parties. Marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $730 20% $691 16% $39 6% Marketing and sales expenses increased by $39 million, or 6 percent, in fiscal year 2010, as compared to fiscal year 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $56 million in marketing, advertising and promotional expenses primarily to support our launch of new franchises and incremental spending on established franchises. This increase was partially offset by an $15 million decrease in personnel related costs primarily resulting from a decrease in headcount as a result of our cost reduction initiatives. Marketing and sales expenses included vendor reimbursements for advertising expenses of $39 million and $31 million in fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. We expect marketing and sales expenses to remain flat in absolute dollars during fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related expenses of executive and administrative staff, related overhead costs, fees for professional services such as legal and accounting, and allowances for doubtful accounts. General and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $320 9% $332 8% $(12) (4%) General and administrative expenses decreased by $12 million, or 4 percent, in fiscal year 2010, as compared to fiscal year 2009 primarily due to (1) a decrease of $14 million in stock based compensation expense and (2) a decrease of $7 million in additional personnel related costs resulting from our cost reduction initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in facilities related expenses primarily due to a $14 million loss on our lease obligation related to the purchase of our Redwood Shores headquarters facilities. We expect general and administrative expenses to decrease in absolute dollars during fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010, primarily due to lower contracted services and facilities related expenses, partially offset by higher personnel related expenses. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred by our production studios for personnel related costs, related overhead costs, contracted services, depreciation and any impairment of prepaid royalties for pre launch products. Research and development expenses for our online business include expenses incurred by our studios consisting of direct development and related overhead costs in connection with the development and production of our online games. Research and development expenses also include expenses associated with the development of web site content, software licenses and maintenance, network infrastructure and management overhead. 44 Table of Contents Research and development expenses for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $1,229 34% $1,359 32% $(130) (10%) Research and development expenses decreased by $130 million, or 10 percent, in fiscal year 2010, as compared to fiscal year 2009. The decrease was primarily due to (1) a decrease of $82 million in additional personnel related costs primarily resulting from our cost reduction initiatives, (2) a decrease of $46 million in external development and contracted services, and (3) a decrease of $24 million in stock based compensation expense. These decreases were partially offset by a $23 million increase in incentive based compensation expense. We expect research and development expenses to decrease in absolute dollars during fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 primarily due to a decrease in external development costs and lower facilities related expenses. Restructuring Charges Restructuring charges for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $140 4% $80 2% $60 75% Fiscal 2010 Restructuring In fiscal year 2010, we announced details of a restructuring plan to narrow our product portfolio to provide greater focus on titles with higher margin opportunities. Under this plan, we reduced our workforce by approximately 1,200 employees and have been (1) consolidating or closing various facilities, (2) eliminating certain titles, and (3) incurring IT and other costs to assist in reorganizing certain activities. The majority of these actions were completed by March 31, 2010. During fiscal year 2010, we incurred $116 million of restructuring charges, of which (1) $62 million were for employee related expenses, (2) $32 million related to intangible asset impairment costs, abandoned rights to intellectual property, and other costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions, and (3) $22 million related to the closure of certain of our facilities. In fiscal year 2011, we anticipate incurring between $15 million and $20 million of restructuring charges related to the fiscal 2010 restructuring. Overall, including charges incurred through March 31, 2010, we expect to incur total cash and non cash charges between $140 million and $145 million by March 31, 2012. These charges consist primarily of (1) employee related costs (approximately $65 million), (2) intangible asset impairment costs, abandoned rights to intellectual property costs, and other costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions (approximately $35 million), (3) facilities exit costs (approximately $25 million), and (4) other reorganizational costs including IT and consulting costs (approximately $20 million). Fiscal 2009 Restructuring During fiscal year 2010, we incurred $14 million of restructuring charges, primarily for facilities related expenses. During fiscal year 2009, we incurred $41 million of restructuring charges, of which $32 million was for employee related expenses and $7 million was for facilities related expenses. We do not expect to incur any additional restructuring charges under this plan. Fiscal 2008 Reorganization During fiscal year 2010, we incurred $10 million of reorganization charges, primarily related to other expenses, including contracted services costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions. During fiscal 45 Table of Contents year 2009, we incurred $34 million of reorganization charges, of which $22 million was for facilities related expenses and $12 million related to other expenses, including contracted services costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions. We do not expect to incur any additional charges under this plan. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 was as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $53 1% $58 1% $(5) (9%) Amortization of intangibles decreased by $5 million, or 9 percent, in fiscal year 2010, as compared to fiscal year 2009, primarily due to a change in the estimated useful lives of certain intangibles. This decrease is partially offset by the amortization of intangibles related to our acquisition of Playfish. Acquired In Process Technology Prior to the adoption of FASB ASC 805, upon consummation of an acquisition, we generally incurred a charge for the related acquired in process technology, as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The development of a majority of the projects for which we incurred an acquired in process technology charge in connection with our acquisition of VGH were either completed or did not reach technological feasibility and therefore were abandoned. As of March 31, 2010, we had one project in connection with our acquisition of VGH that continued to be in process. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. Certain Abandoned Acquisition Related Costs Certain abandoned acquisition related costs consist of costs we incurred in connection with the abandoned acquisition of Take Two. On August 18, 2008, we allowed our tender offer for Take Two shares to expire and on September 14, 2008, we announced that we had terminated discussions with Take Two. As a result, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, we recognized $21 million in related costs consisting of legal, banking and other consulting fees. Goodwill Impairment Adverse economic conditions, including the decline in our market capitalization and our expected financial performance at the time, indicated that a potential impairment of goodwill existed during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. As a result, we performed goodwill impairment tests for our reporting units. As a result of the goodwill impairment analysis, we determined that our EA Mobile reporting units goodwill was impaired. Substantially all of our goodwill associated with our EA Mobile reporting unit was derived from our fiscal 2006 acquisition of JAMDAT Mobile Inc. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $368 million related to our EA Mobile reporting unit. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for our reporting units, and we determined that there were no indicators of impairment to our goodwill. There were no events or circumstances subsequent to the completion of our impairment testing that indicated an assessment was necessary. Losses on Strategic Investments, Net Losses on strategic investments, net for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $(26) (1%) $(62) (1%) $36 58% 46 Table of Contents During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, losses on strategic investments, net decreased by $36 million, or 58 percent, as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. We recognized a $26 million impairment charge on our investment in The9 during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, we recognized (1) $40 million of impairment charges on our investments in Neowizs common and preferred shares and (2) a $27 million impairment charge on our investment in The9. These charges were offset by a $5 million dividend received from our investment in The9. Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net, for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $6 $34 1% $(28) (82%) For fiscal year 2010, interest and other income, net, decreased by $28 million, or 82 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2009, primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from lower yields and balances on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Income Taxes Income tax provision (benefit) for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 EffectiveTax Rate March 31,2009 EffectiveTax Rate % Change $(29) (4.1%) $233 27.2% (112%) Our effective income tax rate was a tax benefit of 4.1 percent for fiscal year 2010. Our effective income tax rate was 27.2 percent for fiscal year 2009. In fiscal year 2010, our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0 percent due primarily to U.S. losses for which no benefit is recognized, tax charges related to our integration of Playfish, non U.S. losses with a reduced or zero tax benefit and non deductible stock based compensation expenses, partially offset by benefits related to the resolution of examinations by taxing authorities and reductions in the valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets. In fiscal year 2009, we recorded a tax provision instead of a tax benefit on the pre tax loss due primarily to the deferred tax valuation allowance. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0 percent due primarily to the deferred tax valuation allowance, non deductible goodwill impairment, non deductible stock based compensation expenses, non deductible losses on strategic investments, losses in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. rate of 35.0 percent, and a loss on facility impairment for which the future tax benefit is uncertain and not more likely than not to be realized. Our effective income tax rates for fiscal year 2011 and future periods will depend on a variety of factors, including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance, as well as changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions, changes in our international structure, changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in the geographic mix of income, changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other matters, and variations in our annual pre tax income or loss. We incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pre tax consolidated income or loss. As a result, in absolute dollar terms, our tax provision will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pre tax income or loss than at higher levels. In addition, at lower levels of pre tax income or loss, our effective tax rate will be more volatile. Certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit 47 Table of Contents of deferred tax assets. For example, in determining the valuation allowance we recorded at June 30, 2009, we did not include as a source of future taxable income the taxable temporary difference related to the accumulated tax depreciation on our headquarters facilities in Redwood City, California. On July 13, 2009, we purchased our Redwood Shores headquarters facilities concurrent with the expiration and extinguishment of the lessors financing agreements. These facilities were subject to lease obligations to non affiliated parties which expired in July 2009, and had been accounted for as operating leases. The total amount paid under the terms of the leases was $247 million, of which $233 million related to the purchase price of the facilities and $14 million was for the loss on our lease obligation. Therefore, in the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2009, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $31 million, consisting of approximately $6 million related to the loss on our lease obligation and a $25 million reduction in our valuation allowance due to the inclusion of a significant portion of the remaining taxable temporary difference as a source of future taxable income. The Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009 (the Act) was signed into law on November 6, 2009. The Act provides that taxpayers may elect to increase the carry back period for tax losses incurred in a taxable year beginning or ending in either 2008 or 2009. During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2009, we elected to increase the carry back period for tax losses incurred in fiscal year 2009. This election resulted in a reduction in the valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets due to an increase in the sources of taxable income from the extended carry back period. As a result, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $28 million in the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2009 for the reduction in the valuation allowance. We historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States and, accordingly, no U.S. taxes have been provided thereon. We currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the United States.

We generally recognize volume discounts when they are earned from the manufacturer (typically in connection with the achievement of unit based milestones), whereas other vendor reimbursements are generally recognized as the related revenue is recognized. Cost of goods sold for our online products consists primarily of data center and bandwidth costs associated with hosting our web sites, credit card fees and royalties for use of third party properties. Cost of goods sold for our web site advertising business primarily consists of server costs.

The overall increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was mitigated by an increase of $372 million in the Recognition of Revenue Deferral and a $109 million decrease in the Revenue Deferral, as discussed in the Net Revenue section above, which decreased the cost of goods sold as a percent of total net revenue by approximately 6 percent. Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expenses consist of personnel related costs, related overhead costs and advertising, marketing and promotional expenses, net of qualified advertising cost reimbursements from third parties. 51 Table of Contents Marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue March 31,2008 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $691 16 % $ 588 16 % $ 103 18 % Marketing and sales expenses increased by $103 million, or 18 percent, in fiscal year 2009, as compared to fiscal year 2008. The increase was primarily due to (1) an increase of $85 million in marketing, advertising and promotional expenses primarily to support our launch of new franchises and incremental spending on established franchises and (2) a $17 million increase in additional personnel related costs primarily resulting from an increase in headcount prior to actions taken under our fiscal 2009 restructuring.

The increase was primarily due to (1) higher external development costs of $120 million due to a greater number of projects in development as compared to the prior year and the recognition of costs related to our acquisition of VGH for all of fiscal year 2009 compared to approximately three months in fiscal year 2008, (2) an increase of $66 million in additional personnel related costs primarily resulting from an increase in headcount prior to actions taken under our fiscal 2009 restructuring, (3) an increase of $43 million in stock based compensation expense, and (4) an increase in facilities related expenses of $8 million to support our research and development functions worldwide. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $26 million in incentive based compensation expense. 52 Table of Contents Goodwill Impairment Adverse economic conditions, including the decline in our market capitalization and our expected financial performance at the time, indicated that a potential impairment of goodwill existed during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. As a result, we performed goodwill impairment tests for our reporting units. As a result of the goodwill impairment analysis, we determined that our EA Mobile reporting units goodwill was impaired.

Certain Abandoned Acquisition Related Costs Certain abandoned acquisition related costs consist of costs we incurred in connection with the abandoned acquisition of Take Two. On August 18, 2008, we allowed our tender offer for Take Two shares to expire and on September 14, 2008, we announced that we had terminated discussions with Take Two. As a result, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, we recognized $21 million in related costs consisting of legal, banking and other consulting fees. 53 Table of Contents Acquired In Process Technology Acquired in process technology includes the value of products in the development stage that are not considered to have reached technological feasibility or have an alternative future use. Accordingly, prior to the adoption of FASB ASC 805, upon consummation of an acquisition, we generally incurred a charge for the related acquired in process technology, as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. Acquired in process technology charges for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue March 31,2008 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $3 $138 4% $(135) (98%) Acquired in process technology decreased by $135 million, or 98 percent, in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008, primarily due to the charge of $138 million related to our acquisition of VGH in fiscal year 2008. Losses on Strategic Investments, Net Losses on strategic investments, net for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue March 31,2008 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $(62) (1%) $(118) (3%) $56 (47%) During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, losses on strategic investments, net decreased by $56 million, or 47 percent, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2008. We recognized (1) a $40 million impairment charge on our investments in Neowizs common and preferred shares and (2) a $27 million impairment charge on our investment in The9 during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. These charges were partially offset by a $5 million dividend received from our investment in The9. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, we recognized (1) an $81 million impairment charge on our investment in The9 and (2) a $37 million impairment charge on our investments in Neowiz Corporations common and preferred shares. Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net, for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue March 31,2008 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $34 1% $98 3% $(64) (65%) For fiscal year 2009, interest and other income, net, decreased by $64 million, or 65 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2008, primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from lower yields on our cash, cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Income Taxes Income tax provision (benefit) for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2009 EffectiveTax Rate March 31,2008 EffectiveTax Rate % Change $233 27.2% $(53) (10.3%) (540%) 54 Table of Contents In fiscal year 2009, we recorded a tax provision instead of a tax benefit on the pre tax loss due primarily to the deferred tax valuation allowance. Our effective income tax provision rate was 27.2 percent for fiscal year 2009. Our effective income tax was a benefit of 10.3 percent for fiscal year 2008. In fiscal year 2009, our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0 percent due primarily to the deferred tax valuation allowance, non deductible goodwill impairment, non deductible stock based compensation expenses, non deductible losses on strategic investments, losses in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. rate of 35.0 percent, and a loss on facility impairment for which the future tax benefit is uncertain and not more likely than not to be realized. In fiscal year 2008, our effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0 percent due primarily to non deductible acquisition related costs, losses on strategic investments, a loss on facility impairment for which the future tax benefit is uncertain and not more likely than not to be realized, and certain non deductible stock based compensation expenses. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009 13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. This guidance modifies the fair value requirements of FASB ASC subtopic 605 25, Revenue Recognition Multiple Element Arrangements, by allowing the use of the best estimate of selling price in addition to vendor specific objective evidence and third party evidence for determining the selling price of a deliverable. This guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which is based on: (a) vendor specific objective evidence, (b) third party evidence, or (c) estimated selling prices. In addition, the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted. ASU 2009 13 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2009 13 to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009 14, Software (Topic 985) Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements. This guidance modifies the scope of FASB ASC subtopic 965 605, Software Revenue Recognition, to exclude from its requirements non software components of tangible products and software components of tangible products that are sold, licensed, or leased with tangible products when the software components and non software components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality. ASU 2009 14 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.

The increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to decreases in personnel related costs and external development and contracted services as part of our cost reduction initiatives, as well as a reduction in incentive based compensation payments. For fiscal year 2010, we generated $710 million of cash proceeds from maturities and sales of short term investments. Our primary use of cash in non operating activities consisted of (1) $611 million used to purchase short term investments, (2) $305 million in capital expenditures, of which $233 million was used to purchase our Redwood Shores headquarters facilities, (3) $283 million used for acquisitions, of which $275 million, net of cash acquired, was used to fund our acquisition of Playfish, and (4) a $100 million increase in acquisition related restricted cash for contingent consideration in connection with our acquisition of Playfish. Short term Investments and Marketable Equity Securities Due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities, our short term investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in short term interest rates. As of March 31, 2010, our short term investments had gross unrealized gains of $2 million, or less than 1 percent of the total in short term investments, and gross unrealized losses of less than $1 million, or less than 1 percent of the total in short term investments. From time to time, we may liquidate some or all of our short term investments to fund operational needs or other activities, such as capital expenditures, business combinations or stock repurchase programs. Depending on which short term investments we liquidate to fund these activities, we could recognize a portion, or all, of the gross unrealized gains or losses. The fair value of our marketable equity securities decreased to $291 million as of March 31, 2010, from $365 million as of March 31, 2009. This decrease was due to (1) a $31 million decrease in the unrealized gains on our investments, (2) impairment charges of $26 million recognized on our investment in The9, and (3) a $17 million decrease in the cost basis of our investment in The9 resulting from the sale of a portion of this investment. Receivables, Net Our gross accounts receivable balances were $423 million and $333 million as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in our accounts receivable balance was primarily due to higher sales volumes in the 56 Table of Contents fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. Reserves for sales returns, pricing allowances and doubtful accounts as of March 31, 2010 and 2009 was flat at $217 million. As a percentage of trailing nine month net revenue, reserves increased from 6 percent as of March 31, 2009, to 7 percent as of March 31, 2010. We believe these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of potential returns, pricing allowances and doubtful accounts. Inventories Inventories decreased to $100 million as of March 31, 2010 from $217 million as of March 31, 2009, primarily as a result of lower Rock Band inventory. Other Current Assets and Other Assets Other current assets increased to $239 million as of March 31, 2010, from $216 million as of March 31, 2009, while other assets increased to $175 million as of March 31, 2010 from $115 million as of March 31, 2009. Other current assets and other assets combined, increased by $83 million primarily due to a $100 million increase in acquisition related restricted cash for contingent consideration in connection with our acquisition of Playfish. Accounts Payable Accounts payable decreased to $91 million as of March 31, 2010, from $152 million as of March 31, 2009, primarily due to payments related to our inventory purchases and royalty payables. Accrued and Other Current Liabilities Our accrued and other current liabilities decreased to $717 million as of March 31, 2010 from $723 million as of March 31, 2009. The $6 million decrease was primarily due to a $93 million decrease in accrued royalties. This decrease was partially offset by (1) a $39 million increase in contingent consideration in connection with our acquisition of Playfish and (2) an increase of $35 million in our accrued compensation and benefits. Deferred income taxes, net Our net deferred income tax asset position increased by $22 million as of March 31, 2010 as compared to March 31, 2009 primarily due to (1) an increase of $12 million for tax credit and loss carryovers in Canada and the United Kingdom and (2) a net increase of $5 million in U.S. deferred taxes for decreases in the valuation allowance offset by changes in the netting of deferred taxes with liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. Financial Condition We believe that cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, marketable equity securities, cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures and, potentially, future acquisitions or strategic investments. We may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position, facilitate expansion, pursue strategic acquisitions and investments or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. There can be no assurance, however, that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all, or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. The loan financing arrangements supporting our Redwood City headquarters leases, described in the Off Balance Sheet Commitments section below, expired in July 2009. On July 13, 2009, we purchased our Redwood Shores headquarters facilities comprised of approximately 660,000 square feet concurrent with the expiration and extinguishment of the lessors financing agreements. These facilities were subject to lease obligations to non affiliated parties, which expired in July 2009, and had previously been accounted for as operating leases. The total amount paid under the terms of the leases was $247 million, of which $233 million related to the purchase price of the facilities and $14 million was for the loss on our lease obligation. 57 Table of Contents As of March 31, 2010, approximately $734 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments and $161 million of our marketable equity securities were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions. While we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the United States in the short term, if we choose to do so, we would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no United States income tax had been previously provided. We have a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 on file with the SEC. This shelf registration statement, which includes a base prospectus, allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings. Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus, we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including for working capital, financing capital expenditures, research and development, marketing and distribution efforts and, if opportunities arise, for acquisitions or strategic alliances. Pending such uses, we may invest the net proceeds in interest bearing securities. In addition, we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time. Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those related to customer demand and acceptance of our products, our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due, successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives, the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may engage, the impact of competition, economic conditions in the United States and abroad, the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and operating results, risks of product returns and the other risks described in the Risk Factors section, included in Part I, Item 1A of this report. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Development, Celebrity, League and Content Licenses: Payments and Commitments The products we produce in our studios are designed and created by our employee designers, artists, software programmers and by non employee software developers (independent artists or third party developers). We typically advance development funds to the independent artists and third party developers during development of our games, usually in installment payments made upon the completion of specified development milestones. Contractually, these payments are generally considered advances against subsequent royalties on the sales of the products. These terms are set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists and third party developers. In addition, we have certain celebrity, league and content license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments that may not be dependent on any deliverables. Celebrities and organizations with whom we have contracts include: FIFA, FIFPRO Foundation, FAPL (Football Association Premier League Limited), and DFL Deutsche Fu&szlig;ball Liga GmbH (German Soccer League) (professional soccer); National Basketball Association (professional basketball); PGA TOUR and Tiger Woods (professional golf); National Hockey League and NHL Players Association (professional hockey); Warner Bros. (Harry Potter); National Football League Properties, PLAYERS Inc., and Red Bear Inc. (professional football); Collegiate Licensing Company (collegiate football and basketball); ESPN (content in EA SPORTS games); Hasbro, Inc. (most of Hasbros toy and game intellectual properties); and the Estate of Robert Ludlum (Robert Ludlum novels and films). These developer and content license commitments represent the sum of (1) the cash payments due under non royalty bearing licenses and services agreements and (2) the minimum guaranteed payments and advances against royalties due under royalty bearing licenses and services agreements, the majority of which are conditional upon performance by the counterparty. These minimum guarantee payments and any related marketing commitments are included in the table below. 58 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations as of March 31, 2010, and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions): Contractual Obligations Fiscal Year Ending March 31, Leases(a) Developer/LicensorCommitments(b) Marketing OtherPurchaseObligations Total 2011 $ 46 $ 253 $ 91 $ 2 $ 392 2012 39 244 53 1 337 2013 32 164 47 243 2014 23 12 27 62 2015 18 13 15 46 Thereafter 23 607 92 722 Total $ 181 $ 1,293 $ 325 $ 3 $ 1,802 (a) See discussion on operating leases in the Off Balance Sheet Commitments section below for additional information. Lease commitments have not been reduced by minimum sub lease rentals for unutilized office space resulting from our reorganization activities of approximately $13 million due in the future under non cancelable sub leases. (b) Developer/licensor commitments include $13 million of commitments that have been recorded in current and long term liabilities and a corresponding amount in current and long term assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2010 because payment is not contingent upon performance by the developer or licensor. The amounts represented in the table above reflect our minimal cash obligations for the respective fiscal years, but do not necessarily represent the periods in which they will be expensed in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to what is included in the table above as of March 31, 2010, we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling $277 million, of which approximately $35 million is offset by prior cash deposits to tax authorities for issues pending resolution. For the remaining liability, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur. In connection with our acquisition of Playfish on November 9, 2009, we may be required to pay additional variable cash consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance milestones through December 31, 2011. The additional consideration is limited to a maximum of $100 million. Subsequent to March 31, 2010, we entered into various licensor and development agreements with third parties, which contingently commits us to pay up to $170 million at various dates through fiscal year 2016. No single licensor and development agreement represented greater than one third of the total $170 million. Related Person Transaction Prior to becoming Chief Executive Officer of Electronic Arts, John Riccitiello was a co founder and Managing Partner of Elevation Partners, L.P., and also served as Chief Executive Officer of VGH, which we acquired in January 2008. At the time of the acquisition, Mr. Riccitiello held an indirect financial interest in VGH resulting from his interest in the entity that controlled Elevation Partners, L.P. and his interest in a limited partner of Elevation Partners, L.P. Elevation Partners, L.P. was a significant stockholder of VGH. As a result of the acquisition, Mr. Riccitiellos financial returns related to these interests, including returns of deemed capital contributions, were $2.4 million through May 2008 (some of which Mr. Riccitiello could be required to return depending on the performance of the Elevation entities). Mr. Riccitiello has not received any additional payments related to the VGH acquisition to date. However, he could receive up to an additional $1.6 million plus any interest or other amounts earned thereon. This amount could be reduced, however, by a variety of factors, 59 Table of Contents including investment losses of Elevation, if any, as well as certain expenses of Elevation that could offset partnership profits. Upon his separation from Elevation Partners, L.P., Mr. Riccitiello ceased to have any further control or influence over these factors. From the commencement of negotiations with VGH, at the direction of EAs Board of Directors, EAs Audit Committee engaged directly with EA management (independently from Mr. Riccitiello) to analyze and consider the potential benefits, risks and material terms of the acquisition. EAs Board of Directors approved the acquisition after reviewing with EAs management and members of the Audit Committee the terms of the acquisition and the potential benefits and risks thereof, as well as Mr. Riccitiellos personal financial interest in VGH and the acquisition. Mr. Riccitiello recused himself from the Board of Directors meeting during the Boards deliberation of the acquisition and he did not vote on the acquisition. OFF BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS Lease Commitments As of March 31, 2010, we leased certain of our current facilities, furniture and equipment under non cancelable operating lease agreements. We were required to pay property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs for certain of these facilities and any increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder of our facilities. On July 13, 2009, we purchased our Redwood Shores headquarters facilities comprised of approximately 660,000 square feet concurrent with the expiration and extinguishment of the lessors financing agreements. These facilities were subject to lease obligations to non affiliated parties, which expired in July 2009, and had previously been accounted for as operating leases. The total amount paid under the terms of the leases was $247 million, of which $233 million related to the purchase price of the facilities and $14 million was for the loss on our lease obligation. Subsequent to our purchase, we classified the facilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as property and equipment, net and depreciate the facilities acquired, excluding land, on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives. Director Indemnity Agreements We entered into indemnification agreements with each of the members of our Board of Directors at the time they joined the Board to indemnify them to the extent permitted by law against any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, amounts paid in settlement and damages incurred by the directors as a result of any lawsuit, or any judicial, administrative or investigative proceeding in which the directors are sued or charged as a result of their service as members of our Board of Directors. INFLATION We believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant in any of the past three fiscal years. 60 Table of Contents Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk MARKET RISK We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and market prices, which have experienced significant volatility in light of the global economic downturn. Market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices. We employ established policies and practices to manage these risks. Foreign currency option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below. While we do not hedge our short term investment portfolio, we protect our short term investment portfolio against different market risks, including interest rate risk as discussed below. Our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. We also do not currently hedge our market price risk relating to our marketable equity securities and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Cash Flow Hedging Activities. From time to time, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency option contracts that generally have maturities of 15 months or less. These transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. The gross amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedge is subsequently reclassified into net revenue or research and development expenses, as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the event that the gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are deemed to be ineffective, the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value, if any, is reclassified to interest and other income, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur, or it becomes remote that they will occur, within the defined hedge period, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income, net, on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our hedging programs are designed to reduce, but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses. As of March 31, 2010, we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately $18 million in foreign currency and to sell approximately $30 million of foreign currencies. All of the foreign currency option contracts outstanding as of March 31, 2010 will mature in the next 12 months. As of March 31, 2009, we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately $19 million in foreign currency and to sell approximately $65 million of foreign currencies. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of $2 million in each year and are included in other current assets. Balance Sheet Hedging Activities. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily intercompany receivables and payables. The foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near month end. Our foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments, and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and gains and losses from changes in fair value are reported in interest and other income, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which are also reported in interest and other income, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In certain cases, the amount of such gains and losses will significantly differ from the amount of gains and losses recognized on the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary asset or liability, in which case our results will be impacted. As of March 31, 2010, we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately $431 million in foreign 61 Table of Contents currencies. Of this amount, $293 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars, $127 million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for U.S. dollars and $11 million to sell foreign currency in exchange for British pounds sterling. As of March 31, 2009, we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately $63 million in foreign currencies. Of this amount, $53 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars, $7 million to purchase foreign currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars and $3 million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for British pounds sterling. The fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was immaterial as of March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2009. We believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward and foreign currency option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks. While we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material, the disruption in the global financial markets has impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. A sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure credit worthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs. Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. As of March 31, 2010, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value of the premiums on our foreign currency option contracts used in cash flow hedging of $1 million in both scenarios. A hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would have resulted in potential losses on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of $42 million and $63 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2010. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; however, all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio. We manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities. However, because short term investments mature relatively quickly and are required to be reinvested at the then current market rates, interest income on a portfolio consisting of short term investments is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term investments. Additionally, the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call, prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value. Our investments are held for purposes other than trading. Also, we do not use derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, our short term investments were classified as available for sale securities and, consequently, were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of any tax effects, in stockholders equity. Our portfolio of short term investments consisted of the following investment categories, summarized by fair value as of March 31, 2010 and 2009 (in millions): As of March 31, 2010 2009 Corporate bonds $ 233 $ 131 U.S. agency securities 115 109 U.S. Treasury securities 83 200 Commercial paper 1 79 Asset backed securities 15 Total short term investments $ 432 $ 534 62 Table of Contents Notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. At any time, a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. The following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our short term investment portfolio as of March 31, 2010, arising from potential changes in interest rates. The modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS.

As of March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2009, our marketable equity securities were classified as available for sale securities and, consequently, were recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of any tax effects, in stockholders equity. The fair value of our marketable equity securities was $291 million and $365 million as of March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2009, respectively. 63 Table of Contents Our marketable equity securities have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by volatility in the public stock markets.
