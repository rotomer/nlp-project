Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW The following overview is a high level discussion of our operating results, as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business. Management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, as well as our future prospects. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Form 10 K, including in the Business section and the Risk Factors above, the remainder of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. About Electronic Arts We develop, market, publish and distribute game software and content that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms, including video game consoles (such as the Sony PLAYSTATION 3, Microsoft Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii), personal computers, mobile phones (such as the Apple iPhone and Google Android compatible phones), tablets and electronic readers (such as the Apple iPad and Amazon Kindle), the Internet, and handheld game players (such as the PlayStation Portable (PSP) and the Nintendo DS and 3DS). Some of our games are based on content that we license from others (e.g., FIFA, Madden NFL, Harry Potter, and Hasbros toy and game intellectual properties), and some of our games are based on our own wholly owned intellectual property (e.g., The Sims, Need for Speed, and Dead Space). Our goal is to publish titles with global mass market appeal, which often means translating and localizing them for sale in non English speaking countries. In addition, we also attempt to create software game franchises that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property. Examples of this franchise approach are the annual iterations of our sports based products (e.g., FIFA, Madden NFL, and NCAA Football), wholly owned properties that can be successfully sequeled (e.g., The Sims, Need for Speed, and Battlefield) and titles based on long lived literary and or movie properties (e.g., Harry Potter). Financial Results Total net revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 was $3,589 million, down $65 million as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. At March 31, 2011, deferred net revenue associated with sales of online enabled packaged goods and digital content increased by $239 million as compared to March 31, 2010, directly reducing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. At March 31, 2010, deferred net revenue associated with sales of online enabled packaged goods and digital content increased by $505 million as compared to March 31, 2009, directly reducing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. Without these changes in deferred net revenue, reported net revenue would have decreased by approximately $331 million during fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010. Net revenue for fiscal year 2011 was driven by FIFA 11, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and Madden NFL 11. Net loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 was $276 million as compared to a net loss of $677 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. Diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 was $0.84 as compared to a diluted loss per share of $2.08 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. Net loss decreased for fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 primarily as a result of (1) a $302 million increase in gross profit due to a decrease in the change in deferred net revenue related to certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content and a greater percentage of net revenue from EA studio and digital products, which have higher margins than our co publishing and distribution products, (2) a $76 million decrease in research and development costs, and (3) a $49 million increase in our gains (losses) on strategic investments, net. These decreases were partially offset by (1) a $26 million decrease in the benefit from income taxes and (2) an increase of $21 million in restructuring and other charges primarily from our fiscal 2011 restructuring. During fiscal year 2011, we generated $320 million of cash from operating activities as compared to generating $152 million in fiscal year 2010. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to (1) a greater percentage of net revenue from EA studio and 28 Table of Contents digital products, which have higher margins than our co publishing and distribution products, (2) the timing of payments related to our inventory purchases, (3) our cost reduction initiatives, including decreases in external development and contracted services, and (4) lower marketing and advertising spend as a result of a decrease in the number of titles released as compared to the prior year. Trends in Our Business Digital Content Distribution and Services. Consumers are spending an ever increasing portion of their money and time on interactive entertainment that is accessible online, or through mobile digital devices such as smart phones, or through social networks such as Facebook. We provide a variety of online delivered products and services. Many of our games that are available as packaged goods products are also available through direct online download through the Internet. We also offer online delivered content and services that are add ons or related to our packaged goods products such as additional game content or enhancements of multiplayer services. Further, we provide other games, content and services that are available only via electronic delivery, such as Internet only games and game services, and games for mobile devices. Advances in mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving devices that are being used to play games by an ever broadening base of consumers. We have responded to these advances in technology and consumer acceptance of digital distribution by offering different sales models, such as subscription services, online downloads for a one time fee, and advertising supported free to play games and game sites. In addition, we offer our consumers the ability to play a game across platforms on multiple devices. We significantly increased the revenues that we derive from online delivered products and services from $432 million in fiscal year 2009, to $522 million in fiscal year 2010 and $743 million in fiscal year 2011 and we expect this portion of our business to continue to grow in fiscal 2012 and beyond. Wireless and other Emerging Platforms. Advances in technology have resulted in a variety of platforms for interactive entertainment. Examples include wireless technologies, streaming gaming services, and Internet connected televisions. Our efforts in wireless interactive entertainment are focused in two areas games for handheld game systems and downloadable games for mobile devices. These platforms grow the consumer base for our business while also providing competition to existing established video game platforms. We expect sales of games for wireless and other emerging platforms to continue to be an important part of our business. Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Games. We see a larger portion of packaged goods games sales concentrated on the most popular titles, and that those titles are typically sequels of prior games. We have responded to this trend by significantly reducing the number of games that we produce to provide greater focus on our most promising intellectual properties from 67 primary titles in fiscal year 2009 to 54 in fiscal year 2010 and 36 primary titles in fiscal year 2011. In fiscal year 2012, we expect to release approximately 22 primary titles. Consequently, we have decreased the number of games that we distribute, which have lower margins, as well as reduced our exposure to the declining music games genre. Catalog Sales. The video game industry is experiencing a change in retail sales patterns, which is decreasing revenue from catalog sales (sales of games in the periods following the launch quarter). Currently, many console games experience sales cycles that are shorter than in the past. To mitigate this trend, we offer our consumers a direct to consumer service (such as head to head play or other multiplayer options) and or additional content available through online services to further enhance the gaming experience and extend the time that consumers play our games after their initial purchase. We anticipate that in some cases these additional online services will also generate revenue to mitigate the effect of reduced catalog sales. Used Games. Some retailers sell used video games, which are generally priced lower than new video games and do not result in revenue to the publisher of the games from the sale. We have observed that the market for used video games has been growing. If retailers continue to increase their sales of used video games, it could negatively affect our sales of new video games and have an adverse impact on our operating results. 29 Table of Contents Recent Developments Stock Repurchase Program. In February 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $600 million of our common stock over the next 18 months. As of March 31, 2011, we had repurchased $58 million of our common stock, or approximately 3 million shares, in the open market since the commencement of the program, including pursuant to a pre arranged stock trading plan. Under the program, we may purchase stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws, including pursuant to pre arranged stock trading plans. The timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price, capital availability, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities, and other market conditions. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares under the program and the repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. Fiscal 2011 Restructuring. In fiscal year 2011, we announced a plan focused on the restructuring of certain licensing and developer agreements in an effort to improve the long term profitability of our packaged goods business. Under this plan, we amended certain licensing and developer agreements. To a much lesser extent, as part of this restructuring we had workforce reductions and facilities closures through March 31, 2011. Substantially all of these exit activities were completed by March 31, 2011. Since the inception of the fiscal 2011 restructuring plan through March 31, 2011, we have incurred charges of $148 million, consisting of (1) $104 million related to the amendment of certain licensing agreements and other intangible asset impairment costs, (2) $31 million related to the amendment of certain developer agreements, and (3) $13 million in employee related expenses. In fiscal year 2012, we anticipate incurring less than $10 million of restructuring and other charges related to the fiscal 2011 restructuring (primarily interest expense accretion). Sale of Ubisoft Investment. We purchased approximately 19.9 percent of the then outstanding ordinary shares (representing approximately 18 percent of the voting rights at the time) of Ubisoft Entertainment (Ubisoft) in February 2005 for $91 million. In July 2010, we sold our investment in Ubisoft for approximately $121 million and realized a gain of $28 million, net of costs to sell. International Operations and Foreign Currency Exchange Impact. International sales (revenue derived from countries other than Canada and the United States), are a fundamental part of our business. Net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately 49 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2011 and approximately 45 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2010. Our net revenue is impacted by foreign exchange rates during the reporting period associated with net revenue before revenue deferral, as well as the foreign exchange rates associated with the recognition of deferred net revenue of online enabled packaged goods and digital content that were established at the time we recorded this deferred net revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The foreign exchange rates during the reporting period may not always move in the same direction as the foreign exchange rate impact associated with the recognition of deferred net revenue of online enabled packaged goods and digital content. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, foreign exchange rates had an overall unfavorable impact on our net revenue of approximately $71 million, or 2 percent. In addition, our international investments and our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, then foreign exchange rates may have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations and our financial condition. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown. As a result, actual results may differ materially from our estimates. 30 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns, Allowances and Bad Debt Reserves We derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games (1) on video game consoles (such as the PLAYSTATION 3, Xbox 360 and Wii), PCs, and handheld game players (such as the PSP and Nintendo DS and 3DS), (2) on mobile devices (such as cellular and smart phones including the Apple iPhone), (3) on tablets such as the Apple iPad, and (4) from software products and content and online services associated with these products. We evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 985 605, Software: Revenue Recognition, and Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. We evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met: Evidence of an arrangement. Evidence of an agreement with the customer that reflects the terms and conditions to deliver products that must be present in order to recognize revenue. Delivery. Delivery is considered to occur when a product is shipped and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer. For online game services, delivery is considered to occur as the service is provided. For digital downloads that do not have an online service component, delivery is generally considered to occur when the download is made available. Fixed or determinable fee. If a portion of the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue as the amount becomes fixed or determinable. Collection is deemed probable. We conduct a credit review of each customer involved in a significant transaction to determine the creditworthiness of the customer. Collection is deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due. If we determine that collection is not probable, we recognize revenue when collection becomes probable (generally upon cash collection). Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and management judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report in each period. For example, for multiple element arrangements, we must make assumptions and judgments in order to (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered, (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services, (3) determine whether vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) exists for each undelivered element, and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver. Changes to any of these assumptions or management judgments, or changes to the elements in a software arrangement, could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Depending on the type of product, we may offer an online service that permits consumers to play against others via the Internet and or receive additional updates or content from us. For those games that consumers can play via the Internet, we may provide a matchmaking service that permits consumers to connect with other consumers to play against each other online. In those situations where we do not require an additional fee for this online service, we account for the sale of the software product and the online service as a bundled sale, or multiple element arrangement, in which we sell both the software product and the online service for one combined price. We defer net revenue from sales of these games for which we do not have VSOE for the online service that we provided in connection with the sale, and recognize the revenue from these games over the estimated online service period, which is generally estimated to be six months beginning in the month after shipment. In addition, for some software products we also provide updates or additional content (digital content) to be delivered via the Internet that can be used with the original software product. In many cases we separately sell digital content for an additional fee; however, some purchased digital content can only be accessed via the Internet (i.e., the consumer never takes possession of the digital content). We account for online transactions in which the consumer does not take possession of the digital content as a service transaction and, accordingly, we recognize the associated revenue over the estimated service period. In other transactions, at the date we sell the software product we have an obligation to provide incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee. In these cases, we account for the sale of the software product as a multiple element arrangement and recognize the revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated period of game play. 31 Table of Contents Determining whether a transaction constitutes an online service transaction or a digital content download of a product requires judgment and can be difficult. The accounting for these transactions is significantly different. Revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available (assuming all other recognition criteria are met). Revenue from an online game service is recognized as the service is rendered. If the service period is not defined, we recognize the revenue over the estimated service period. Determining the estimated service period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage. In addition, determining whether we have an implicit obligation to provide incremental unspecified future digital content without an additional fee can be difficult. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors (channel partners), is recognized when the above four criteria are met. We reduce product revenue for estimated future returns, price protection, and other offerings, which may occur with our customers and channel partners. Price protection represents the right to receive a credit allowance in the event we lower our wholesale price on a particular product. The amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old price and the new price. In certain countries, we have stock balancing programs for our PC and video game system software products, which allow for the exchange of these software products by resellers under certain circumstances. It is our general practice to exchange software products or give credits rather than to give cash refunds. In certain countries, from time to time, we decide to provide price protection for our software products. When evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances, we analyze historical returns, current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our software products, current trends in retail and the video game industry, changes in customer demand and acceptance of our software products, and other related factors. In addition, we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories, as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods. In the future, actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing software products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report. For example, if actual returns and or price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established, our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue. Conversely, if actual returns and or price protection were significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our reported total net revenue. In addition, if our estimates of returns and price protection related to online enabled packaged goods software products change, the amount of deferred net revenue we recognize in the future would change. Significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period. We determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and historical experience. Depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers, the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly. Fair Value Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item in order to fairly present our financial statements. Without an independent market or another representative transaction, determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the accounting. There are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value. These include (1) the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value, (2) the 32 Table of Contents income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, future cash flows or future earnings) to a single present value amount, and (3) the cost approach, which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset. For many of our fair value estimates, including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets and acquired in process technology, we use the income approach. Using the income approach requires the use of financial models, which require us to make various estimates including, but not limited to (1) the potential future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured, (2) the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows, (3) the time value of money associated with the expected receipt or payment of such cash flows, and (4) the inherent risk associated with the cash flows (risk premium). Making these cash flow estimates are inherently difficult and subjective, and, if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate, our financial results may be negatively impacted. Furthermore, relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached. For example, a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired. While we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions, the following areas are the most sensitive to these assessments: Business Combinations. We must estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities and contingencies assumed, acquired in process technology, and contingent consideration issued in a business combination. Our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets and acquired in process technology are amortized over various estimated useful lives. Furthermore, a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill, an asset that is not amortized. Determining the fair value of assets acquired requires an assessment of the highest and best use or the expected price to sell the asset and the related expected future cash flows. Determining the fair value of acquired in process technology also requires an assessment of our expectations related to the use of that asset. Determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to transfer the liability. Determining the fair value of contingent consideration issued requires an assessment of the expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled, and applying a discount rate that appropriately captures a market participants view of the risk associated with the obligation. This fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination. Such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Assessment of Impairment of Goodwill, Intangibles, and Other Long Lived Assets. Current accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability of our finite lived acquisition related intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the remaining value of the assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is potentially impaired. In order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred, management must make various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated future cash flows. For some assets, our estimated fair value is dependent upon predicting which of our products will be successful. This success is dependent upon several factors, which are beyond our control, such as which operating platforms will be successful in the marketplace. Also, our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules. We are required to perform a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. Our reporting units are determined by the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which (1) discrete financial information is available and (2) segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We are required to perform the impairment test at least annually by applying a fair value based test. The first step measures for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the reporting unit level. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. To determine the fair value of each reporting unit used in the first step, we use a combination of the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies data, and or the income approach, which utilizes discounted 33 Table of Contents cash flows. Determining whether an event or change in circumstances does or does not indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount is inherently subjective. Each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include long term growth rates, tax rates, and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. These estimates and assumptions have to be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment. As of the last annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, we concluded that the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units adequately exceeded their carrying amounts and we have not identified any indicators of impairment since. Our estimates for market growth, our market share and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Our business consists of developing, marketing and distributing video game software using both established and emerging intellectual properties and our forecasts for emerging intellectual properties are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information and have an inherently higher risk of accuracy. If future forecasts are revised, they may indicate or require future impairment charges. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. Assessment of Impairment of Short Term Investments and Marketable Equity Securities. We periodically review our short term investments and marketable equity securities for impairment. Our short term investments consist of securities with remaining maturities greater than three months at the time of purchase and our marketable equity securities consist of investments in common stock of publicly traded companies, both are accounted for as available for sale securities. Unrealized gains and losses on our short term investments and marketable equity securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity, net of tax, until either (1) the security is sold, (2) the security has matured, or (3) we determine that the fair value of the security has declined below its adjusted cost basis and the decline is other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on our short term investments and marketable equity securities are calculated based on the specific identification method and are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income, net, and gains (losses) on strategic investments, net, respectively. Determining whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each security. The ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the credit quality of the issuer, the duration that the fair value has been less than the adjusted cost basis, severity of the impairment, reason for the decline in value and potential recovery period, the financial condition and near term prospects of the investees, and our intent to sell and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, any contractual terms impacting the prepayment or settlement process, as well as, if we would be required to sell an investment due to liquidity or contractual reasons before its anticipated recovery. Our ongoing consideration of these factors could result in impairment charges in the future, which could have a material impact on our financial results. Assessment of Inventory Obsolescence. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand. We write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products. Inventory write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value, based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess. At the point of a loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Stock Based Compensation We are required to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant. We recognize compensation costs for stock based payment awards to employees based on the grant date fair value using a straight line approach over the service period for which such awards are expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock is determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock on 34 Table of Contents the date of grant. The fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and our 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, respectively, is determined using the Black Scholes valuation model. The determination of fair value is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award. Generally, our assumptions are based on historical information and judgment is required to determine if historical trends may be indicators of future outcomes. The key assumptions for the Black Scholes valuation calculation are: Risk free interest rate. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option. Expected volatility. We use a combination of historical stock price volatility and implied volatility computed based on the price of options publicly traded on our common stock for our expected volatility assumption. Expected term. The expected term represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. The expected term is determined based on historical exercise behavior, post vesting termination patterns, options outstanding and future expected exercise behavior. Expected dividends. Employee stock based compensation expense is calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and an adjustment to stock based compensation expense will be recognized at that time. Changes to our assumptions used in the Black Scholes option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rate, as well as future equity granted or assumed through acquisitions could significantly impact the compensation expense we recognize. Royalties and Licenses Our royalty expenses consist of payments to (1) content licensors, (2) independent software developers, and (3) co publishing and distribution affiliates. License royalties consist of payments made to celebrities, professional sports organizations, movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks, copyrights, personal publicity rights, content and or other intellectual property. Royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games. Co publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products. Royalty based obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid. These royalty based obligations are generally expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the contractual rate for contracts with guaranteed minimums, or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue. Significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract. Because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue, it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors, including (1) the total number of titles subject to the contract, (2) the timing of the release of these titles, (3) the number of software units we expect to sell, which can be impacted by a number of variables, including product quality, the timing of the titles release and competition, and (4) future pricing. Determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products. Accordingly, if our future revenue projections change, our effective royalty rates would change, which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize. Prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and co publishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and, therefore, we are generally 35 Table of Contents subject to development risk prior to the release of the product. Accordingly, payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred. Payments due after completion of the product (primarily royalty based in nature) are generally expensed as cost of goods sold. Our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments, which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor. When performance remains with the licensor, we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred, rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract. Royalty liabilities are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next 12 months. Each quarter, we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royalty based assets, as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales. Any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense. Impairments or losses determined post launch are charged to cost of goods sold. We evaluate long lived royalty based assets for impairment generally using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist. Unrecognized minimum royalty based commitments are accounted for as executory contracts and, therefore, any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned (i.e., cease use) or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated. Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carry forwards. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified. It is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. Forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results, particularly in light of the economic environment. Therefore, cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment. In addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income, we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets, namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, the carry back of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. Evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments. Each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence; this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity. Certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets. Based on the assumptions and requirements noted above, we have recorded a valuation allowance against most of our U.S. deferred tax assets. In addition, we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future U.S. tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods. This process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate. These estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation, as well as with respect to other matters, such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to 36 Table of Contents our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities. The ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations. In addition, changes in our business, including acquisitions, changes in our international corporate structure, changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in the geographic mix and amount of income, as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities, valuation allowances, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other matters, and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate. We historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States and, accordingly, no U.S. taxes have been provided thereon. We currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the United States. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our fiscal year is reported on a 52 or 53 week period that ends on the Saturday nearest March 31. Our results of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2009 each contained 52 weeks and ended on April 2, 2011 and March 28, 2009, respectively. Our results of operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 contained 53 weeks and ended on April 3, 2010. For simplicity of disclosure, all fiscal periods are referred to as ending on a calendar month end. Comparison of Fiscal Year 2011 to Fiscal Year 2010 Net Revenue Net revenue consists of sales generated from (1) video games sold as packaged goods and designed for play on hardware consoles (such as the PLAYSTATION 3, Xbox 360 and Wii), PCs, and handheld game players (such as the Sony PSP and Nintendo DS and 3DS), (2) video games for mobile devices (such as cellular and smart phones including the Apple iPhone), (3) video games for tablets such as the Apple iPad, (4) software products and content and online services associated with these products, (5) programming third party websites with our game content, (6) allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products, and (7) advertisements on our online web pages and in our games. Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral, a non GAAP financial measure, is provided in this section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A). See Non GAAP Financial Measures below for an explanation of our use of this non GAAP measure. A reconciliation to the corresponding measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States is provided in the discussion below. Revenue Deferral in this Net Revenue section includes the unrecognized revenue from (1) bundled sales of certain online enabled packaged goods and PC digital downloads for which either we do not have VSOE for the online service that we provide in connection with the sale of the software or we have an obligation to provide future incremental unspecified digital content, (2) certain packaged goods sales of massively multiplayer online role playing games, and (3) sales of certain incremental digital content associated with our games, which are types of micro transactions. Fluctuations in the Revenue Deferral are largely dependent upon the amounts of products that we sell with the online features and services previously discussed, while the Recognition of Revenue Deferral for a period is also dependent upon (1) the period of time the online features and services are to be provided and (2) the timing of the sale. For example, most Revenue Deferrals incurred in the first half of a fiscal year are recognized within the same fiscal year; however, substantially all of the Revenue Deferrals incurred in the last month of a fiscal year will be recognized in the subsequent fiscal year. 37 Table of Contents From a geographical perspective, our total Net Revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 was as follows (in millions): Year Ended March 31, 2011 2010 NorthAmerica Europe Asia Total NorthAmerica Europe Asia Total Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral $ 1,907 $ 1,722 $ 199 $ 3,828 $ 2,322 $ 1,615 $ 222 $ 4,159 Revenue Deferral (1,358 ) (1,273 ) (138 ) (2,769 ) (1,255 ) (981 ) (122 ) (2,358 ) Recognition of Revenue Deferral 1,287 1,114 129 2,530 958 799 96 1,853 Net Revenue $ 1,836 $ 1,563 $ 190 $ 3,589 $ 2,025 $ 1,433 $ 196 $ 3,654 Worldwide For fiscal year 2011, Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral was $3,828 million, driven by FIFA 11, Madden NFL 11, and Need for Speed Hot Pursuit. Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral for fiscal year 2011 decreased $331 million, or 8 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2010.

Non GAAP Financial Measures Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral is a non GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of Revenue Deferral and the Recognition of Revenue Deferral on Net Revenue related to packaged goods games and digital content. We defer Net Revenue from sales of certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content for which we are not able to objectively determine the fair value (as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for software sales) of the online service that we provide in connection with the sale. We recognize the revenue from these games over the estimated online service period. We also defer Net Revenue from sales of certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content for which we had an obligation to deliver incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee. We recognize the revenue for these games on a straight line basis over the estimated period of game play. We believe that excluding the impact of Revenue Deferral and the Recognition of Revenue Deferral related to packaged goods games and digital content from our operating results is important to facilitate comparisons between periods in understanding our underlying sales performance for the period. We use this non GAAP measure internally to evaluate our operating performance, when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, and when assessing the performance of our management team. While we believe that this non GAAP financial measure is useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non GAAP financial measure may not be the same as non GAAP measures presented by other companies. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold for our packaged goods business consists of (1) product costs, (2) certain royalty expenses for celebrities, professional sports and other organizations and independent software developers, (3) manufacturing royalties, net of volume discounts and other vendor reimbursements, (4) expenses for defective products, (5) write offs of post launch prepaid royalty costs, (6) amortization of certain intangible assets, (7) personnel related costs, and (8) warehousing and distribution costs. We generally recognize volume discounts when they are earned from the manufacturer (typically in connection with the achievement of unit based milestones); whereas other vendor reimbursements are generally recognized as the related revenue is recognized. Cost of goods sold for our online products consists primarily of data center and bandwidth costs associated with hosting our websites, credit card fees and royalties for use of third party properties. Cost of goods sold for our website advertising business primarily consists of server costs. 40 Table of Contents Cost of goods sold for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 was as follows (in millions): March 31,2011 % of NetRevenue March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue % Change Change as a% of NetRevenue $1,499 41.8% $1,866 51.1% (19.7%) (9.3%) During fiscal year 2011, cost of goods sold decreased by 9.3 percent as a percentage of total net revenue as compared to fiscal year 2010. This decrease as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to (1) a $266 million decrease in the change in deferred net revenue related to certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content for fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010, which positively impacted gross profit as a percent of total net revenue by 3.7 percentage points and (2) a greater percentage of net revenue from EA studio and digital products, which have a higher margin than our co publishing and distribution products, which positively impacted gross profit as a percentage of total revenue by approximately 3.3 percent. Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expenses consist of personnel related costs, related overhead costs and advertising, marketing and promotional expenses, net of qualified advertising cost reimbursements from third parties. Marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2011 % of NetRevenue March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $747 21% $730 20% $17 2% Marketing and sales expenses increased by $17 million, or 2 percent, in fiscal year 2011, as compared to fiscal year 2010. The increase was primarily due to (1) a $13 million increase in additional personnel related costs and (2) a $5 million increase in stock based compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by a $5 million decrease in marketing, advertising and promotional expenses resulting from a decrease in the number of titles released during fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010. Marketing and sales expenses included vendor reimbursements for advertising expenses of $31 million and $39 million in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related expenses of executive and administrative staff, related overhead costs, fees for professional services such as legal and accounting, and allowances for doubtful accounts. General and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2011 % of NetRevenue March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $301 8% $320 9% $(19) (6%) General and administrative expenses decreased by $19 million, or 6 percent, in fiscal year 2011, as compared to fiscal year 2010 primarily due to (1) a $25 million decrease in facilities related expenses, primarily as a result of the $14 million loss on our lease obligation related to our Redwood Shores headquarters facilities in fiscal year 2010 and (2) an $18 million decrease in contracted services due to costs related to the support of business development projects in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by (1) a $13 million increase in additional personnel related costs, (2) a $12 million increase in incentive based compensation expense, and (3) a $7 million increase in stock based compensation expense. 41 Table of Contents Research and Development Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred by our production studios for personnel related costs, related overhead costs, contracted services, depreciation and any impairment of prepaid royalties for pre launch products. Research and development expenses for our online products include expenses incurred by our studios consisting of direct development and related overhead costs in connection with the development and production of our online games. Research and development expenses also include expenses associated with the development of website content, software licenses and maintenance, network infrastructure and management overhead. Research and development expenses for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2011 % of NetRevenue March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $1,153 32% $1,229 34% $(76) (6%) Research and development expenses decreased by $76 million, or 6 percent, in fiscal year 2011, as compared to fiscal year 2010. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in expenses resulting from our cost reduction initiatives including (1) a $38 million decrease in external development and contracted services, (2) a $37 million decrease in additional personnel related costs, and (3) a $27 million decrease in facilities related expenses primarily due to lower depreciation expense. These decreases were partially offset by a $24 million increase in incentive based compensation expense. Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring and other charges for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2011 % of NetRevenue March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $161 4% $140 4% $21 15% Fiscal 2011 Restructuring In fiscal year 2011, we announced a plan focused on the restructuring of certain licensing and developer agreements in an effort to improve the long term profitability of our packaged goods business. Under this plan, we amended certain licensing and developer agreements. To a much lesser extent, as part of this restructuring we had workforce reductions and facilities closures through March 31, 2011. Substantially all of these exit activities were completed by March 31, 2011. During fiscal year 2011, we incurred charges of $148 million, consisting of (1) $104 million related to the amendment of certain licensing agreements and other intangible asset impairment costs, (2) $31 million related to the amendment of certain developer agreements, and (3) $13 million in employee related expenses. In fiscal year 2012, we anticipate incurring less than $10 million of restructuring and other charges related to the fiscal 2011 restructuring (primarily interest expense accretion). Overall, including $148 million in charges incurred through March 31, 2011, we expect to incur total cash and non cash charges between $170 million and $180 million by June 2016. These charges will consist primarily of (1) charges, including accretion of interest expense, related to the amendment of certain licensing and developer agreements and other intangible asset impairment costs (approximately $160 million) and (2) employee related costs (approximately $15 million). Fiscal 2010 Restructuring In connection with our fiscal 2010 restructuring plan, during fiscal year 2011, we incurred $13 million of restructuring charges primarily due to costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions. 42 Table of Contents During fiscal year 2010, we incurred $116 million of restructuring charges of which (1) $62 million were for employee related expenses, (2) $32 million related to intangible asset impairment costs, abandoned rights to intellectual property, and costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions, and (3) $22 million related to the closure of certain of our facilities. In fiscal year 2012, we anticipate incurring less than $10 million of restructuring charges related to the fiscal 2010 restructuring. Overall, including charges incurred through March 31, 2011, we expect to incur total cash and non cash charges of approximately $135 million by March 31, 2012. These charges consist primarily of (1) employee related costs (approximately $62 million), (2) intangible asset impairment costs, abandoned rights to intellectual property costs, and other costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions (approximately $50 million), and (3) facilities exit costs (approximately $22 million). Other Restructuring and Reorganization In connection with our fiscal 2009 restructuring plan and fiscal 2008 reorganization plan, during fiscal year 2010, we incurred $14 million and $10 million of charges, respectively, primarily for facilities related expenses under the fiscal 2009 plan and contracted services costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions under the fiscal 2008 plan. We do not expect to incur any additional charges under these plans. Acquisition Related Contingent Consideration Acquisition related contingent consideration related to Playfish decreased $19 million for the fiscal year 2011 as compared to the fiscal year 2010, resulting from a revision in our estimate of the expected future cash flows over the period in which the contingent obligation is expected to be settled. See Note 2 and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. Gains (Losses) on Strategic Investments, Net Gains (losses) on strategic investments, net, for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2011 % of NetRevenue March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue $ Change $23 1% $(26) (1%) $49 During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, gains (losses) on strategic investments, net increased by $49 million as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, primarily due to a realized gain of $28 million, net of costs to sell, from the sale of our investment in Ubisoft. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, we recognized a $26 million impairment charge on our investment in The9. Income Taxes Benefit from income taxes for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 was as follows (in millions): March 31,2011 EffectiveTax Rate March 31,2010 EffectiveTax Rate $(3) (1.1%) $(29) (4.1%) Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2011 was a tax benefit of 1.1 percent. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2010 was a tax benefit of 4.1 percent. In fiscal year 2011, the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35.0 percent primarily due to U.S. losses for which no benefit is recognized, non U.S. losses with a reduced or zero tax benefit and non deductible stock based compensation expenses, partially offset by tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of examination by taxing authorities. In fiscal year 2010, the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35.0 percent primarily due to U.S. losses for which no benefit is recognized, tax charges related to our integration of Playfish, non U.S. losses with a reduced or zero 43 Table of Contents tax benefit, and non deductible stock based compensation expenses, partially offset by benefits related to the resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities and reductions in the valuation allowance of U.S. deferred tax assets. Our effective income tax rates for fiscal year 2012 and future periods will depend on a variety of factors, including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance, as well as changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions, changes in our international structure, changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in the geographic mix of income, changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other matters, and variations in our annual pre tax income or loss. We incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pre tax consolidated income or loss. As a result, in absolute dollar terms, our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pre tax income or loss than at higher levels. In addition, at lower levels of pre tax income or loss, our effective tax rate will be more volatile. Certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law have not been considered as a source of future taxable income that is available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Act) was signed into law on December 17, 2010. The Act contains a number of provisions including, most notably, a two year extension of the research tax credit. The Act will not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 due to the effect of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. The Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009 (the Act) was signed into law on November 6, 2009. The Act provides that taxpayers may elect to increase the carry back period for tax losses incurred in a taxable year beginning or ending in either 2008 or 2009. During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2009, we elected to increase the carry back period for tax losses incurred in fiscal year 2009. This election resulted in a reduction in the valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets due to an increase in the sources of taxable income from the extended carry back period. As a result, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $28 million in the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2009 for the reduction in the valuation allowance. We historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States and, accordingly, no U.S. taxes have been provided thereon. We currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the United States. Comparison of Fiscal Year 2010 to Fiscal Year 2009 Net Revenue From a geographical perspective, our total Net Revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 was as follows (in millions): Year Ended March 31, 2010 2009 NorthAmerica Europe Asia Total NorthAmerica Europe Asia Total Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral $ 2,322 $ 1,615 $ 222 $ 4,159 $ 2,362 $ 1,521 $ 203 $ 4,086 Revenue Deferral (1,255 ) (981 ) (122 ) (2,358 ) (538 ) (472 ) (67 ) (1,077 ) Recognition of Revenue Deferral 958 799 96 1,853 588 540 75 1,203 Net Revenue $ 2,025 $ 1,433 $ 196 $ 3,654 $ 2,412 $ 1,589 $ 211 $ 4,212 44 Table of Contents Worldwide For fiscal year 2010, Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral was $4,159 million, driven by FIFA 10, Madden NFL 10, and The Sims 3. Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral for fiscal year 2010 increased $73 million, or 2 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2009. This increase was driven by a $535 million increase from sales of Dragon Age and EA SPORTS Active franchises, which were released in 2010 with no comparable releases in 2009, as well as The Sims and the Battlefield franchises. This increase was partially offset by a $483 million decrease from the Rock Band, Spore and Mercenaries franchises. Revenue Deferral for fiscal year 2010 increased $1,281 million, or 119 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2009. Starting in fiscal year 2010, we began to sell substantially all of our online enabled products released after April 1, 2009, with an obligation to provide future incremental unspecified digital content on a when and if available basis. As we did not have VSOE for this obligation, we were required to recognize the revenue associated with this bundled sale over the estimated period of game play.

Non GAAP Financial Measures See Non GAAP Financial Measures above for more information on our use of Net Revenue before Revenue Deferral as a measure of our operating results. 46 Table of Contents Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 was as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue % Change Change as a% of NetRevenue $1,866 51.1% $2,127 50.5% (12.3%) 0.6% During fiscal year 2010, cost of goods sold increased by 0.6 percent as a percentage of total net revenue as compared to fiscal year 2009. This increase was primarily due to a $631 million increase in the change in deferred net revenue related to certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Overall, we estimate the increase in the change in deferred net revenue related to certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content negatively impacted cost of goods sold as a percent of total net revenue by 7.7 percentage points. The overall increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was partially mitigated by (1) a greater percentage of net revenue from EA studio products, which have a higher margin than our co publishing and distribution products, which positively impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenue by approximately 3.1 percent and (2) EA Studio products that we sold which had previously been written down to a lower cost basis and lower inventory write downs on our fiscal year 2010 releases as compared to our fiscal year 2009 releases, which positively impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenue by approximately 2.1 percent. Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $730 20% $691 16% $39 6% Marketing and sales expenses increased by $39 million, or 6 percent, in fiscal year 2010, as compared to fiscal year 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $56 million in marketing, advertising and promotional expenses primarily to support our launch of new franchises and incremental spending on established franchises. This increase was partially offset by an $15 million decrease in personnel related costs primarily resulting from a decrease in headcount as a result of our cost reduction initiatives. Marketing and sales expenses included vendor reimbursements for advertising expenses of $39 million and $31 million in fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $320 9% $332 8% $(12) (4%) General and administrative expenses decreased by $12 million, or 4 percent, in fiscal year 2010, as compared to fiscal year 2009 primarily due to (1) a decrease of $14 million in stock based compensation expense and (2) a decrease of $7 million in additional personnel related costs resulting from our cost reduction initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in facilities related expenses primarily due to a $14 million loss on our lease obligation related to the purchase of our Redwood Shores headquarters facilities. Research and Development Research and development expenses for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $1,229 34% $1,359 32% $(130) (10%) 47 Table of Contents Research and development expenses decreased by $130 million, or 10 percent, in fiscal year 2010, as compared to fiscal year 2009. The decrease was primarily due to (1) a decrease of $82 million in additional personnel related costs primarily resulting from our cost reduction initiatives, (2) a decrease of $46 million in external development and contracted services, and (3) a decrease of $24 million in stock based compensation expense. These decreases were partially offset by a $23 million increase in incentive based compensation expense. Restructuring Charges Restructuring charges for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $140 4% $80 2% $60 75% Fiscal 2010 Restructuring In fiscal year 2010, we announced a restructuring plan to narrow our product portfolio to provide greater focus on titles with higher margin opportunities. Under this plan, we reduced our workforce by approximately 1,100 employees and have (1) consolidated or closed various facilities, (2) eliminated certain titles, and (3) incurred IT and other costs to assist in reorganizing certain activities. Substantially all of these exit activities were completed by March 31, 2010. During fiscal year 2010, we incurred $116 million of restructuring charges, of which (1) $62 million were for employee related expenses, (2) $32 million related to intangible asset impairment costs, abandoned rights to intellectual property, and other costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions, and (3) $22 million related to the closure of certain of our facilities. Other Restructuring and Reorganization In connection with our fiscal 2009 restructuring plan and fiscal 2008 reorganization plan, during fiscal year 2010, we incurred $14 million and $10 million of charges, respectively, primarily for facilities related expenses under the fiscal 2009 plan and contracted services costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions under the fiscal 2008 plan. During fiscal year 2009, we incurred $41 million and $34 million under these plans, respectively, primarily for employee related expenses under the fiscal 2009 plan and facilities related expenses under the fiscal 2008 plan. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 was as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $53 1% $58 1% $(5) (9%) Amortization of intangibles decreased by $5 million, or 9 percent, in fiscal year 2010, as compared to fiscal year 2009, primarily due to a change in the estimated useful lives of certain intangibles. This decrease is partially offset by the amortization of intangibles related to our acquisition of Playfish. Acquired In Process Technology Prior to the adoption of FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, upon consummation of an acquisition, we generally incurred a charge for the related acquired in process technology, as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The development of a majority of the projects for which we incurred an acquired in process technology charge in connection with our acquisition of VG Holding Corp. (VGH) were either completed or did not reach technological feasibility and therefore were abandoned. As of March 31, 2010, we had one project in connection with our acquisition of VGH that continued to be in process. 48 Table of Contents Certain Abandoned Acquisition Related Costs Certain abandoned acquisition related costs consist of costs we incurred in connection with the abandoned acquisition of Take Two. On August 18, 2008, we allowed our tender offer for Take Two shares to expire and on September 14, 2008, we announced that we had terminated discussions with Take Two. As a result, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, we recognized $21 million in related costs consisting of legal, banking and other consulting fees. Goodwill Impairment Adverse economic conditions, including the decline in our market capitalization and our expected financial performance at the time, indicated that a potential impairment of goodwill existed during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. As a result, we performed goodwill impairment tests for our reporting units. As a result of the goodwill impairment analysis, we determined that our EA Mobile reporting units goodwill was impaired. Substantially all of our goodwill associated with our EA Mobile reporting unit was derived from our fiscal 2006 acquisition of JAMDAT Mobile Inc. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $368 million related to our EA Mobile reporting unit. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for our reporting units, and we determined that there were no indicators of impairment to our goodwill. Gains (Losses) on Strategic Investments, Net Gains (losses) on strategic investments, net for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $(26) (1%) $(62) (1%) $36 58% During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, gains (losses) on strategic investments, net decreased by $36 million, or 58 percent, as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. We recognized a $26 million impairment charge on our investment in The9 during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, we recognized (1) $40 million of impairment charges on our investments in Neowizs common and preferred shares and (2) a $27 million impairment charge on our investment in The9. These charges were offset by a $5 million dividend received from our investment in The9. Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net, for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 % of NetRevenue March 31,2009 % of NetRevenue $ Change % Change $6 $34 1% $(28) (82%) For fiscal year 2010, interest and other income, net, decreased by $28 million, or 82 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2009, primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from lower yields and balances on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Income Taxes Provision for (benefit from) income taxes for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in millions): March 31,2010 EffectiveTax Rate March 31,2009 EffectiveTax Rate % Change $(29) (4.1%) $233 27.2% (112%) Our effective income tax rate was a tax benefit of 4.1 percent for fiscal year 2010. Our effective income tax rate was 27.2 percent for fiscal year 2009. In fiscal year 2010, our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory 49 Table of Contents tax rate of 35.0 percent due primarily to U.S. losses for which no benefit is recognized, tax charges related to our integration of Playfish, non U.S. losses with a reduced or zero tax benefit and non deductible stock based compensation expenses, partially offset by benefits related to the resolution of examinations by taxing authorities and reductions in the valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets. In fiscal year 2009, we recorded a tax provision instead of a tax benefit on the pre tax loss due primarily to the deferred tax valuation allowance. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0 percent due primarily to the deferred tax valuation allowance, non deductible goodwill impairment, non deductible stock based compensation expenses, non deductible losses on strategic investments, losses in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. rate of 35.0 percent, and a loss on facility impairment for which the future tax benefit is uncertain and not more likely than not to be realized. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009 13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. This guidance modifies the fair value requirements of FASB ASC subtopic 605 25, Revenue Recognition Multiple Element Arrangements, by allowing the use of the best estimate of selling price in addition to vendor specific objective evidence and third party evidence for determining the selling price of a deliverable for non software arrangements. This guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which is based on: (a) vendor specific objective evidence, (b) third party evidence, or (c) estimates. In addition, the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted. ASU 2009 13 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2009 13 to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009 14, Software (Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements. This guidance modifies the scope of FASB ASC subtopic 985 605, Software Revenue Recognition, to exclude from its requirements non software components of tangible products and software components of tangible products that are sold, licensed, or leased with tangible products when the software components and non software components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality. ASU 2009 14 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2009 14 to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 50 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As ofMarch 31, Increase /(Decrease) (In millions) 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,579 $ 1,273 $ 306 Short term investments 497 432 65 Marketable equity securities 161 291 (130 ) Total $ 2,237 $ 1,996 $ 241 Percentage of total assets 45 % 43 % Year EndedMarch 31, Increase /(Decrease) (In millions) 2011 2010 Cash provided by operating activities $ 320 $ 152 $ 168 Cash used in investing activities (15 ) (572 ) 557 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities (23 ) 53 (76 ) Effect of foreign exchange on cash and cash equivalents 24 19 5 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 306 $ (348 ) $ 654 Changes in Cash Flow Operating Activities. During fiscal year 2011, we generated $320 million of cash from operating activities as compared to generating $152 million in fiscal year 2010. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to (1) a greater percentage of net revenue from EA studio and digital products, which have higher margins than our co publishing and distribution products, (2) the timing of payments related to our inventory purchases, (3) our cost reduction initiatives, including decreases in external development and contracted services, and (4) lower marketing and advertising spend as a result of a decrease in the number of titles released as compared to the prior year. Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities decreased $557 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 primarily due to (1) a $267 million decrease in cash used for acquisitions, primarily from Playfish during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, (2) a $246 million decrease in capital expenditures, of which $233 million was used to purchase our Redwood Shores headquarters facilities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, (3) $121 million in proceeds received from the sale of our Ubisoft investment, (4) $100 million in acquisition related restricted cash for contingent consideration in connection with our acquisition of Playfish in fiscal year 2010, and (5) a $97 million decrease in purchases of short term investments. These decreases were partially offset by $268 million of lower proceeds received from maturities and sales of short term investments. Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities decreased $76 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 primarily due to $58 million, net of commissions, cash paid for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock. Short term Investments and Marketable Equity Securities Due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities, our short term investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in short term interest rates. As of March 31, 2011, the gross unrealized gains and losses on our short term investments were immaterial and each were less than 1 percent of the total in short term investments. From time to time, we may liquidate some or all of our short term investments to fund operational needs or other activities, such as capital expenditures, business combinations or stock repurchase programs. Depending on which short term investments we liquidate to fund these activities, we could recognize a portion, or all, of the gross unrealized gains or losses. 51 Table of Contents The fair value of our marketable equity securities decreased to $161 million as of March 31, 2011, from $291 million as of March 31, 2010. This decrease was primarily due to a $194 million decrease, resulting from a decrease in the unrealized gains and the sale of a certain investment during the period. This decrease was partially offset by a $73 million increase in the fair value of our investments in Neowiz. Restricted Cash and Contingent Consideration In connection with our acquisitions of Playfish and Chillingo, we may be required to pay an additional $110 million of cash consideration, of which $100 million was deposited into an escrow account. As this deposit is restricted in nature, it is excluded from cash and cash equivalents. This cash consideration is based upon the achievement of certain performance milestones through March 31, 2014. Through fiscal year 2011, no distributions were made from the restricted cash amount. As of March 31, 2011, we have accrued $51 million of contingent consideration on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Fiscal 2011 Restructuring In connection with our fiscal 2011 restructuring plan, we expect to incur cash expenditures through June 2016 of approximately (1) $42 million in fiscal year 2012, (2) $15 million in both fiscal years 2013 and 2014, (3) $11 million in fiscal year 2015, and (4) $40 million thereafter. The actual cash expenditures are variable as they will be dependent upon the actual revenue we generate from certain games. Financial Condition We believe that cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, marketable equity securities, cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures and, potentially, future acquisitions, stock repurchases, or strategic investments. We may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position, facilitate expansion, repurchase our stock, pursue strategic acquisitions and investments, and or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. There can be no assurance, however, that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all, or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. As of March 31, 2011, approximately $793 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments and $69 million of our marketable equity securities were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions. While we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the United States in the short term, if we choose to do so, we would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no United States income tax had been previously provided. During fiscal year 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $600 million of our common stock over the next 18 months. The timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price, capital availability, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares under the program and the repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. We have a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 on file with the SEC. This shelf registration statement, which includes a base prospectus, allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings. Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus, we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including for working capital, financing capital expenditures, research and development, marketing and distribution efforts and, if opportunities arise, for acquisitions or strategic alliances. Pending such uses, we may invest the net proceeds in interest bearing securities. In addition, we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time. Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those related to customer demand and acceptance of our products, our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due, successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted 52 Table of Contents sales objectives, the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may engage, the impact of competition, economic conditions in the United States and abroad, the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and operating results, risks of product returns and the other risks described in the Risk Factors section, included in Part I, Item 1A of this report. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Development, Celebrity, League and Content Licenses: Payments and Commitments The products we produce in our studios are designed and created by our employee designers, artists, software programmers and by non employee software developers (independent artists or third party developers). We typically advance development funds to the independent artists and third party developers during development of our games, usually in installment payments made upon the completion of specified development milestones. Contractually, these payments are generally considered advances against subsequent royalties on the sales of the products. These terms are set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists and third party developers. In addition, we have certain celebrity, league and content license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments that may not be dependent on any deliverables. Celebrities and organizations with whom we have contracts include: FIFA, FIFPRO Foundation, FAPL (Football Association Premier League Limited), and DFL Deutsche Fu&szlig;ball Liga GmbH (German Soccer League) (professional soccer); National Basketball Association (professional basketball); PGA TOUR and Tiger Woods (professional golf); National Hockey League and NHL Players Association (professional hockey); Warner Bros. (Harry Potter); National Football League Properties, PLAYERS Inc., and Red Bear Inc. (professional football); Collegiate Licensing Company (collegiate football); ESPN (content in EA SPORTS games); Hasbro, Inc. (most of Hasbros toy and game intellectual properties); LucasArts and Lucas Licensing (Star Wars: The Old Republic), and the Estate of Robert Ludlum (Robert Ludlum novels and films). These developer and content license commitments represent the sum of (1) the cash payments due under non royalty bearing licenses and services agreements and (2) the minimum guaranteed payments and advances against royalties due under royalty bearing licenses and services agreements, the majority of which are conditional upon performance by the counterparty. These minimum guarantee payments and any related marketing commitments are included in the table below. The following table summarizes our unrecognized minimum contractual obligations as of March 31, 2011, and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions): Contractual Obligations Fiscal Year Ending March 31, Leases(a) Developer/LicensorCommitments Marketing OtherPurchaseObligations Total 2012 $ 44 $ 331 $ 90 $ 8 $ 473 2013 36 199 37 3 275 2014 26 124 66 3 219 2015 21 114 32 2 169 2016 15 83 33 131 Thereafter 9 366 95 470 Total $ 151 $ 1,217 $ 353 $ 16 $ 1,737 (a) See discussion on operating leases in the Off Balance Sheet Commitments section below for additional information. Lease commitments have not been reduced by minimum sub lease rentals for unutilized office space resulting from our reorganization activities of approximately $12 million due in the future under non cancelable sub leases. 53 Table of Contents The amounts represented in the table above reflect our unrecognized minimum cash obligations for the respective fiscal years, but do not necessarily represent the periods in which they will be recognized and expensed in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the amounts in the table above are presented based on the dates the amounts are contractually due; however, certain payment obligations may be accelerated depending on the performance of our operating results. In addition to what is included in the table above as of March 31, 2011, we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling $238 million, of which approximately $37 million is offset by prior cash deposits to tax authorities for issues pending resolution. For the remaining liability, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur. OFF BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS Lease Commitments As of March 31, 2011, we leased certain of our current facilities, furniture and equipment under non cancelable operating lease agreements. We were required to pay property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs for certain of these facilities and any increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder of our facilities. Director Indemnity Agreements We entered into indemnification agreements with each of the members of our Board of Directors at the time they joined the Board to indemnify them to the extent permitted by law against any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, amounts paid in settlement and damages incurred by the Directors as a result of any lawsuit, or any judicial, administrative or investigative proceeding in which the Directors are sued or charged as a result of their service as members of our Board of Directors. INFLATION We believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant in any of the past three fiscal years. 54 Table of Contents Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk MARKET RISK We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and market prices, which have experienced significant volatility in light of the global economic downturn. Market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices. We employ established policies and practices to manage these risks. Foreign currency option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below. While we do not hedge our short term investment portfolio, we protect our short term investment portfolio against different market risks, including interest rate risk as discussed below. Our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. We also do not currently hedge our market price risk relating to our marketable equity securities and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Cash Flow Hedging Activities. From time to time, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency option contracts that generally have maturities of 15 months or less. These transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. The gross amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is subsequently reclassified into net revenue or research and development expenses, as appropriate, in the period when the forecasted transaction is recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the event that the gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are deemed to be ineffective, the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value, if any, is reclassified to interest and other income, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur, or it becomes remote that they will occur, within the defined hedge period, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the reporting periods, all forecasted transactions occurred and, therefore, there were no such gains or losses reclassified into interest and other income, net. Our hedging programs are designed to reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses. As of March 31, 2011, we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately $40 million in foreign currency and to sell approximately $10 million of foreign currency. All of the foreign currency option contracts outstanding as of March 31, 2011 will mature in the next 12 months. As of March 31, 2010, we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately $18 million in foreign currency and to sell approximately $30 million of foreign currencies. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of these outstanding foreign currency option contracts was immaterial and are included in other current assets. Balance Sheet Hedging Activities. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily intercompany receivables and payables. The foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near month end. Our foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments, and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or accrued and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other income, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which are also reported in interest and other income, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In certain cases, the amount of such gains and losses will significantly differ from the amount of gains and losses recognized on the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary asset or liability, in which case our results will be impacted. As of March 31, 2011, we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately $187 million in foreign currencies. Of this amount, $140 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in 55 Table of Contents exchange for U.S. dollars, $31 million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for U.S. dollars, and $16 million to sell foreign currency in exchange for British pounds sterling. As of March 31, 2010, we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately $431 million in foreign currencies. Of this amount, $293 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars, $127 million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for U.S. dollars and $11 million to sell foreign currency in exchange for British pounds sterling. The fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was immaterial as of March 31, 2011 and 2010. We believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks. While we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material, the disruption in the global financial markets has impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. A sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure credit worthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs. Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. As of March 31, 2011, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value of the premiums on our foreign currency option contracts used in cash flow hedging of less than $1 million in each scenario. As of March 31, 2011, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would have resulted in potential losses on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of $17 million and $26 million, respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; however, all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio. We manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities. However, because short term investments mature relatively quickly and are required to be reinvested at the then current market rates, interest income on a portfolio consisting of short term investments is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term investments. Additionally, the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call, prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value. Our investments are held for purposes other than trading. Also, we do not use derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, our short term investments were classified as available for sale securities and, consequently, were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in stockholders equity. Our portfolio of short term investments consisted of the following investment categories, summarized by fair value as of March 31, 2011 and 2010 (in millions): As of March 31, 2011 2010 Corporate bonds $ 253 $ 233 U.S. Treasury securities 124 83 U.S. agency securities 102 115 Commercial paper 18 1 Total short term investments $ 497 $ 432 Notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. At any time, a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. The following table presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value in our short term investment portfolio as of March 31, 2011, arising from 56 Table of Contents potential changes in interest rates. The modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS.

As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, our marketable equity securities were classified as available for sale securities and, consequently, were recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in stockholders equity. The fair value of our marketable equity securities as of March 31, 2011 and 2010 was $161 million and $291 million, respectively. Our marketable equity securities have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by volatility in the public stock markets. At any time, a sharp change in market prices in our investments in marketable equity securities could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments. The following table presents hypothetical changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities as of March 31, 2011, arising from changes in market prices of plus or minus 25 percent, 50 percent, and 75 percent.
