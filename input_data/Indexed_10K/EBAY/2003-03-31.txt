Overview About eBay We pioneered online trading by developing a Web based marketplace in which a community of buyers and sellers are brought together in an entertaining, intuitive, easy to use environment to browse, buy and sell an enormous variety of items. Through our PayPal service, we enable any business or consumer with email to send and receive online payments securely, conveniently and cost effectively. 22 Table of Contents Business Combinations Historically, we have completed several business combinations accounted for using the pooling of interests and purchase methods of accounting. The historical financial information related to companies acquired in pooling of interests transactions was retroactively restated at the time of acquisition, whereas the results of companies acquired under the purchase method of accounting were consolidated with our results on a prospective basis from the acquisition date. During the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, the aggregate purchase price of acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method totaled approximately $1.9 billion. This aggregate purchase price was allocated to goodwill of $1.5 billion, identifiable intangible assets of $297 million, net tangible assets of $189 million, deferred tax liabilities of $43 million, minority interest of $34 million and unearned compensation of $10 million. See Note 3 Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated by reference herein. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, certain data from our consolidated statement of income as a percentage of net revenues. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates as well as the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K.

Our net revenues result from fees associated with our transaction, third party advertising, end to end services, and offline services in our U.S., International and Payments segments. Transaction revenue is derived primarily from listing, feature and final value fees paid by sellers and fees from payment processing services. Revenue from third party advertising is derived principally from the sale of online banner and sponsorship advertisements for cash and through barter arrangements. End to end services revenue is derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide transaction services to eBay and PayPal users. Offline services revenue is derived from a variety of sources including seller commissions, buyer premiums, bidder registration fees and auction related services including appraisal and authentication. The successive year over year growth in net revenues from 2000 through 2002, was primarily the result of increased auction transaction activity, reflected in the growth of the number of registered users, listings and gross merchandise sales. Our acquisition of iBazar S.A. and of a majority interest in Internet Auction Co., Ltd. during 2001 contributed less than 3% of our net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2001. Acquisitions of PayPal, Inc., NeoCom Technology Co., Ltd. and the remaining 50% interest in our Australian subsidiary during 2002, contributed approximately 6% of our net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2002. Our revenue growth during these periods was also positively impacted by fee increases in the U.S. and various international locations. Revenue from U.S. and International Segments Transaction Net Revenue U.S. segment transaction net revenue increased 51% between 2000 and 2001 and 51% between 2001 and 2002. International segment transaction net revenue increased 297% between 2000 and 2001 and 168% between 2001 and 2002. The successive year over year growth in U.S. and International segment transaction net revenues from 2000 to 2002 was primarily the result of increased auction transaction activity, reflected in the growth of the number of registered users, listings and gross merchandise sales. We experienced transaction net revenue growth across all categories during 2001 and 2002 with motors, computers, consumer electronics, collectibles, and books/music/movies making the most significant impact. International segment transaction net revenue as a percentage of consolidated transaction net revenue was 8% in 2000, 18% in 2001 and 27% in 2002. This growth is primarily the result of strong performance in Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada and South Korea. We expect international segment transaction net revenues will continue to grow in significance to our business as we develop and deploy our global marketplace. In addition, new regulations in the European Union relating to the collection of value added taxes, or VAT, on digital services will require us to collect and remit VAT on our own fees beginning in July 2003. We intend to work with the relevant tax authorities to clarify our obligations under these regulations and to change our software to permit the billing of these taxes. The increased costs to our European users may reduce their activity on our websites and could adversely affect our international transaction net revenues. 25 Table of Contents Third party Advertising Net Revenue U.S. third party advertising net revenue increased as a percentage of total U.S. segment net revenues from 3% in 2000 to 13% in 2001. The increase during 2001 was primarily the result of our strategy to increase overall site monetization and the efforts of AOL Time Warner, Inc. or AOL, our exclusive advertising sales representative. During the year ended December 31, 2002, U.S. segment third party advertising decreased in both absolute dollars, from $80.5 million in 2001 to $54.9 million in 2002, and as a percentage of total U.S. segment net revenues, from 13% in 2001 to 7% in 2002. Revenues from U.S. segment third party advertising decreased during 2002 primarily as a result of a general deterioration in the online advertising market that adversely impacted our advertising sales through AOL. International segment third party advertising net revenue decreased as a percentage of total International net revenues from 4% to 3% to 2% in 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. Although the absolute dollar amount of International segment third party advertising net revenues increased during each of these periods, the decreases in International segment third party advertising as a percentage of total International segment net revenues were primarily the result of transaction net revenues growing faster than advertising net revenues. We continue to view our business as primarily transaction driven and we expect third party advertising net revenues in future periods to continue to decrease as a percentage of total net revenues and in absolute dollars. Additionally, our advertising sales representative agreement with AOL has not been extended or renewed and is scheduled to terminate on March 31, 2003, with AOL to continue its electronic delivery of our online advertisements for a specified wind down period. After March 31, 2003, our third party advertising revenues will be dependent on the efforts of our existing internal sales staff. End to End Services Net Revenue U.S. segment end to end services net revenue decreased successively in absolute dollars from $30.8 million in 2000 to $27.1 million in 2001 to $21.6 million in 2002 and as a percentage of total U.S. segment net revenues from 8% in 2000 to 4% in 2001 to 3% in 2002. As end to end services are contractual and are largely dependent upon contractual terms and our users adoption of third party products and services, we expect end to end services revenue in future periods to fluctuate from period to period, however, in general, we expect these revenues to decrease as a percentage of total net revenues and in absolute dollars. Offline Net Revenue Offline net revenue decreased as a percentage of total U.S. segment net revenues from 9% to 5% to 2% in 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2001, offline net revenue decreased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total U.S. segment net revenues compared to 2000, primarily as a result of a general softening in the offline auction and high end art markets. During the year ended December 31, 2002, offline net revenue decreased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total U.S. segment net revenues compared to 2001, primarily as a result of our divestiture of both our Butterfields and Kruse subsidiaries. Accordingly, we do not expect to earn offline net revenue in the foreseeable future. Net Revenues from Payments Segment Net revenues from the Payments segment are generated from eBays Billpoint operations for each of the years presented and PayPals operations for the post acquisition period from October 4, 2002 through December 31, 2002. See Note 3 Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the consolidated notes to the financial statements for pro forma results of operations. Transaction Net Revenue Payments segment transaction net revenue increased 235% year over year between 2000 and 2001 and 452% between 2001 and 2002. The year over year growth in 2001 was the result of increased transaction volume processed by eBays Billpoint payment services. The growth in 2002 was primarily the result of our 26 Table of Contents acquisition of PayPal. For the post acquisition period from October 4, 2002 through December 31, 2002, PayPal recorded transaction net revenue of $72.6 million. We expect to wind down our Billpoint payment operations during the first half of 2003. Third party Advertising and End to End Services Net Revenues Payments segment revenues from third party advertising and end to end services decreased as a percentage of total Payments segment net revenues from 4% in 2001 to 2% in 2002 as transaction net revenues grew faster than third party advertising and end to end services net revenues. We continue to view our business as primarily transaction driven, and we expect Payments segment third party advertising and end to end net revenues in future periods to continue to decrease as a percentage of total net revenues and in absolute dollars. Cost of Net Revenues Percent Percent 2000 Change 2001 Change 2002 (in thousands, except percent changes) Cost of net revenues $ 95,453 41 % $ 134,816 59 % $ 213,876 As a percentage of net revenues 22 % 18 % 18 % Cost of net revenues consists primarily of costs associated with customer support, site operations, and payment processing. Significant cost components include employee compensation and facilities costs for customer support, site operations, Internet connectivity charges, depreciation of site equipment, payment processing fees, amortization of required capitalization of major site and product development costs, including the amortization of capitalized costs related to the development of our third generation V3 site architecture, costs to provide end to end services and promotions and corporate overhead allocations. Cost of net revenues increased in absolute dollars but decreased as a percentage of net revenues from 2000 to 2001. This increase in absolute dollars was due almost entirely to our online business as we continued to develop and expand our customer support and site operations infrastructure. The increases were primarily the result of personnel costs, depreciation of the equipment required for site operations, software licensing fees, Internet connectivity charges and the increased costs associated with acquired businesses. The decrease in cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenue resulted from cost management initiatives and lower technology costs in site operations and increases in higher gross margin businesses such as autos, third party advertising and end to end services and promotions. The combined effect of these activities resulted in our cost of net revenues per listing decreasing from $0.36 in 2000 to $0.32 in 2001. Cost of net revenues increased in absolute dollars but remained constant as a percentage of net revenues from 2001 to 2002. This increase in absolute dollars was due to increased payment processing costs resulting from our acquisition of PayPal and continued development and expansion of our customer support and site operations infrastructure. The increase in payment processing costs totaled $50.4 million and consists of bank charges, credit card interchange fees, and other processing charges. The increase in customer support and site operations costs were primarily the result of increased depreciation of site operations software and equipment of $10.9 million and personnel costs of $7.7 million. Cost of net revenues stayed constant as a percentage of net revenue from 2001 to 2002 and reflects cost efficiencies in both customer support and site operations offset by the addition of PayPals lower margin payments processing business. The combined effect of these activities resulted in our cost of net revenues per listing increasing from $0.32 in 2001 to $0.34 in 2002. We expect the cost of net revenues to increase in absolute dollars and increase as a percentage of net revenues in 2003 as a result of the addition of a full year of PayPals lower margin payments processing business. 27 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Sales and Marketing Percent Percent 2000 Change 2001 Change 2002 (in thousands, except percent changes) Sales and marketing $ 166,767 52 % $ 253,474 38 % $ 349,650 As a percentage of net revenues 39 % 34 % 29 % Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee compensation for our category development and marketing staff, advertising, tradeshow and other promotional costs, certain trust and safety programs and corporate overhead allocations. The growth in absolute dollars from 2000 to 2001 was primarily the result of growth in online and offline advertising, employee compensation costs, costs associated with the use of outside services and consultants, additional costs associated with acquired businesses, and miscellaneous user and promotional costs. The growth in absolute dollars from 2001 to 2002 was primarily the result of increased advertising and marketing costs. Our advertising costs increased by $54.7 million and were directed towards a national television advertising campaign and several category focused print and on line advertising campaigns. Additionally, our referral fees paid to marketing partners increased by $12.6 million during the year in connection with the growth of specific categories, our expenses related to tradeshows and user programs increased by $5.4 million and our professional services fees increased by $5.1 million. Our advertising efforts target the acquisition of registered users and activation of existing users through television, print media placements, promotional agreements with Internet portals and other online service providers. Sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars, and to decrease as a percentage of net revenues in 2003. See Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies Advertising to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated by reference herein. Product Development Percent Percent 2000 Change 2001 Change 2002 (in thousands, except percent changes) Product development $ 55,863 35 % $ 75,288 39 % $ 104,636 As a percentage of net revenues 13 % 10 % 9 % Product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, payments to outside contractors, depreciation on equipment used for development and corporate overhead allocations. Product development expenses do not reflect required capitalization of major site and product development efforts, including the development of our third generation V3 site architecture. These capitalized costs totaling $9.4 million in 2000, $6.7 million in 2001, and $15.5 million in 2002 are reflected as a cost of revenue when amortized. We anticipate that we will continue to devote significant resources to product development in the future as we add new features and functionality to the eBay and PayPal platforms. The increase in absolute dollars from 2000 to 2001 was primarily the result of increases in employee compensation costs, reflected by the growth in our development staff, which increased from 203 at December 31, 2000 to 320 at December 31, 2001, and maintenance and depreciation costs for equipment used in product development. The increase in these costs results from the development of additional site features and functionality such as eBay Stores, eBay Checkout, enhanced payment features and expanded search capabilities. The increase in absolute dollars from 2001 to 2002 was primarily as a result of an $18.9 million increase in employee compensation costs, reflected by the growth in our development staff, which increased from 320 at December 31, 2001 to 635 at December 31, 2002, and a $7.3 million increase in 28 Table of Contents maintenance and depreciation costs for equipment used in research and development. The increase in these costs results from the development of additional site features and functionality such as enhanced search functionality, improved seller tools, expanded eBay Stores merchandising capabilities, added fixed price functionality and improved site security. Product development expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars in 2003, as we develop new site features and functionality and continue to improve and expand operations across all our segments. We expect product development expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2003 to remain generally consistent with 2002 levels. General and Administrative Percent Percent 2000 Change 2001 Change 2002 (in thousands, except percent changes) General and administrative $ 73,027 45 % $ 105,784 62 % $ 171,785 As a percentage of net revenue 17 % 14 % 14 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, provisions for transaction losses associated with our Payments segment, insurance, fees for external professional advisors and corporate overhead allocations. The increase in absolute dollars from 2000 to 2001 was primarily the result of increases in employee compensation costs, reflected by the growth in our general and administrative staff, which increased from 302 at December 31, 2000 to 415 at December 31, 2001, provisions for doubtful accounts, fees for professional services and facilities costs. The increase in these costs reflected our investment in the infrastructure that is necessary to support the growth of our business. The increase in absolute dollars from 2001 to 2002 was primarily the result of increases of $16.0 million in fees for professional services, $12.2 million in the provision for doubtful accounts, $7.8 million in the provision for transaction losses, and $6.5 million in facilities costs. These costs increased to meet the demands of our expanding business, including operations in new countries and the integration of new businesses. To support this growth, we increased our general and administrative staff from 415 at December 31, 2001 to 1,253 at December 31, 2002, which includes the addition of approximately 360 general and administrative employees resulting from our acquisition of PayPal. Of these incremental PayPal employees, a substantial number support PayPals various trust and safety programs. The headcount increase helped us strengthen the existing teams in corporate finance, corporate development, legal and accounting departments as well as in our growing international operations. We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in 2003, as we continue to invest in the infrastructure that is necessary to support our business. Additionally, we expect 2003 general and administrative expense to increase as a percentage of net revenues with the addition of a full year of PayPals operations. Payroll Taxes on Stock Option Gains Percent Percent 2000 Change 2001 Change 2002 (in thousands, except percent changes) Payroll taxes on stock option gains $ 2,337 4 % $ 2,442 64 % $ 4,015 As a percentage of net revenues 1 % 0 % 0 % We are subject to employer payroll taxes on employee gains resulting from exercises of non qualified stock options. These employer payroll taxes are recorded as a charge to operations in the period in which such options are exercised and sold based on actual gains realized by employees. Our quarterly results of operations and cash flows could vary significantly depending on the actual period that stock options are exercised by employees and, consequently, the amount of employer payroll taxes assessed. We expect exercises of employee stock option grants will result in increased payroll tax costs in 2003 partially as a 29 Table of Contents result of gains from the exercise of PayPal options assumed in the merger. In general, we expect payroll taxes on employee stock option gains to increase during periods in which our stock price is high relative to historic levels. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets Percent Percent 2000 Change 2001 Change 2002 (in thousands, except percent changes) Amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 1,433 2,453 % $ 36,591 (56 )% $ 15,941 As a percentage of net revenues 0 % 5 % 1 % From time to time we have purchased, and we expect to continue purchasing, assets or businesses to accelerate category and geographic expansion, increase the features and functions available to our users and maintain a leading role in online trading. These purchase transactions may result in the creation of acquired intangible assets and lead to a corresponding increase in the amortization expense in future periods. Intangible assets are comprised of purchased customer lists, developed technologies, trade names, and other intangible assets. Intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are being amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from two to seven years. We believe the straight line method of amortization best represents the distribution of economic value of the identified intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer subject to amortization. Rather, goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment, applying a fair value based test. Amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased during 2002, primarily from the elimination of goodwill amortization as part of our adoption of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets on January 1, 2002. Identifiable intangible assets arising from our October 3, 2002 acquisition of PayPal consist of PayPals customer list of $196.9 million, its trade name of $63.6 million and developed technologies of $16.5 million. The acquired intangible assets of PayPal will be amortized over the following estimated useful lives: customer list seven years; trade name seven years; and developed technologies three years. This allocation will result in annual amortization of approximately $28.1 million for the customer list, $9.1 million for the trade name and $5.5 million for the existing technologies. We expect the full year of amortization from PayPals acquired intangible assets to result in an increase of amortization expense in 2003. Merger related Costs Percent Percent 2000 Change 2001 Change 2002 (in thousands, except percent changes) Merger related costs $ 1,550 (100 )% $ 0 0 % $ 0 As a percentage of net revenues 0 % 0 % 0 % Merger related costs were primarily attributed to direct costs associated with mergers accounted for under the pooling of interests method. These amounts consist primarily of professional services, contract and facility termination expenses and various registration and filing fees. Direct costs associated with mergers accounted for under the purchase method are capitalized in determining the purchase price. We incurred direct merger related transaction costs in 2000 related to the merger with Half.com. Due to the elimination of the pooling of interests method of accounting, merger related costs related to acquisitions after July 2001 were capitalized as a component of purchase price. 30 Table of Contents Non Operating Items Interest and Other Income, Net Percent Percent 2000 Change 2001 Change 2002 (in thousands, except percent changes) Interest and other income, net $ 46,337 (10 )% $ 41,613 18 % $ 49,209 As a percentage of net revenues 11 % 6 % 4 % Interest and other income, net consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, and investments as well as foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and other miscellaneous non operating transactions. Our interest and other income, net decreased during 2001 as a result of a lower interest rate environment. Our weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.3% in 2000 and 3.6% in 2001. Although, we maintained higher cash, cash equivalent and investment balances during 2001 as a result of increased operating and financing cash flows, the decrease in interest rates resulted in an overall decline in interest income. Our interest and other income, net increased during 2002 primarily as a result of gains from the sale of our Butterfields subsidiary and certain real estate properties of $10.6 million, a gain on the sale of our Kruse subsidiaries of $6.5 million and a gain on the sale of an equity investment in a privately held company of $3.2 million. These gains were offset by a decrease in interest and investment income of $4.1 million resulting from lower average interest rates, despite an increase in our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balances in 2002 and from decreased realized gains on the sale of investments, and a decrease in foreign exchange gains of $3.5 million. Our weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.6% in 2001 and 2.8% in 2002. We expect that interest and other income, net will decrease in 2003, as we do not expect significant gains from the sale of assets or subsidiaries in 2003. Interest Expense Percent Percent 2000 Change 2001 Change 2002 (in thousands, except percent changes) Interest expense $ 3,374 (16 )% $ 2,851 (48 )% $ 1,492 As a percentage of net revenues 1 % 0 % 0 % Interest expense consists of interest charges on mortgage notes and capital leases. Interest expense decreased from 2000 to 2001, as a result of lower interest rates and a reduction in outstanding debt balances. Interest expense decreased from 2001 to 2002 as a result of a reduction in the outstanding mortgage notes balances in connection with the sale of several of the underlying properties. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, addresses consolidation by business enterprises of certain variable interest entities where there is a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity or where the variable interest entity does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. This interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and applies in the first year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003 to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. We expect that the adoption of FIN 46 will require us to include our San Jose facilities lease arrangement and potentially certain investments in our Consolidated Financial Statements effective July 1, 2003. In connection with our San Jose facilities lease arrangement, our balance sheet following the July 1, 2003 adoption of FIN 46 will reflect changes to record assets of $126.4 million, liabilities of $122.5 million and non controlling interests of $3.9 million. In addition, our post adoption income statement will reflect the reclassification of 31 Table of Contents rent expense payments from operating expenses to interest expense as well as the recognition of depreciation expense, within operating expenses, for our use of the buildings. We estimate that the income statement impact of consolidating our San Jose facilities lease will consist of a charge against earnings, net of taxes, of $5.7 million upon the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. This charge will reflect the accumulated depreciation charges that would have been recorded in previous periods had consolidation of the San Jose facilities been required. Additionally, we have not decided whether we will keep the existing financing arrangement or purchase the San Jose facilities. Whether or not we keep the existing financing arrangement, we anticipate recording additional annual operating expenses of $1.7 million, net of taxes, for the recognition of depreciation expense on the buildings. In the event we purchase the San Jose facilities, we will also pay $126.4 million, eliminate financing payments and settle our two interest rate swaps we used to establish a fixed rate of interest for $95 million of our financing arrangement. During the year ended December 31, 2002, our financing payments related to the San Jose facilities totaled $7.9 million. At December 31, 2002, settlement of our two interest rate swaps would have resulted in a loss of $10.9 million. Impairment of Certain Equity Investments Percent Percent 2000 Change 2001 Change 2002 (in thousands, except percent changes) Impairment of certain equity investments $ 0 100 % $ 16,245 (77 )% $ 3,781 As a percentage of net revenues 0 % 2 % 0 % During the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded impairment charges totaling $16.2 million relating primarily to the impairment in the fair value of certain private equity investments. We recorded impairment charges for these investments based upon the deterioration of the financial condition of certain investees and based upon financing obtained by certain other investees at a valuation below which we made our investment. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded impairment charges totaling $3.8 million relating to the impairment in the fair value of certain equity investments. We recorded an approximately $640,000 impairment charge for an equity investment in a public company based upon a significant decline in the market value of our investment during 2002, which we determined to be other than temporary. We recorded $3.2 million in impairment charges for certain private equity investments based upon the deterioration of the financial condition of certain investees and as a result of financing obtained by certain other investees at a valuation below which we made our investment. We expect that the fair value of our equity investments will fluctuate from time to time and future impairment assessments may result in additional charges to our operating results. Provision for Income Taxes Percent Percent 2000 Change 2001 Change 2002 (in thousands, except percent changes) Provision for income taxes $ 32,725 144 % $ 80,009 82 % $ 145,946 As a percentage of net revenues 8 % 11 % 12 % Effective tax rate 40 % 47 % 37 % The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory U.S. federal rate principally due to non deductible expenses related to acquisitions, state taxes, subsidiary losses for which we have not provided a benefit and other permanent differences that increase the effective tax rate. These amounts are partially offset by decreases resulting from foreign income with lower effective tax rates and tax exempt interest income. 32 Table of Contents We receive tax deductions from the gains realized by employees on the exercise of certain non qualified stock options for which the benefit is recognized as a component of stockholders equity. We have provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to these stock option deductions due to the uncertainties associated with our future stock price and the timing of employee stock option exercises. To the extent that additional stock option deductions are not generated in future years, we will have the ability, subject to carryforward limitations, to utilize up to $207.3 million of additional deferred tax assets to reduce future income tax liabilities. When recognized, the tax benefit of tax deductions related to stock options are accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital rather than a reduction of the income tax provision. Minority Interests in Consolidated Companies Percent Percent 2000 Change 2001 Change 2002 (in thousands, except percent changes) Minority interests in consolidated companies $ 3,062 145 % $ 7,514 (131)% $ (2,296 ) As a percentage of net revenue 1 % 1 % 0 % Minority interests in consolidated companies represents the minority investors percentage share of income or losses from subsidiaries in which we hold a majority ownership interest and consolidate the subsidiaries results in our financial statements. Third parties held minority interests in Billpoint and eBay Japan in 2000; in Billpoint, Internet Auction, and eBay Japan in 2001; in Billpoint for part of 2002 and Internet Auction for all of 2002. The decrease in minority interests from 2001 to 2002 primarily resulted from Internet Auction generating net income for the first time in 2002. Additionally, our January 2002 acquisition of the remaining 35% minority interest in Billpoint previously held by Wells Fargo Bank also contributed to the decrease. We expect that minority interests in consolidated companies will continue to fluctuate in future periods. If Internet Auction, our majority owned South Korean subsidiary, continues to be profitable, the minority interests adjustment on the statement of income will continue to decrease our net income by the minority investors share of Internet Auctions net income. Impact of Foreign Currency Translation The growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. We have foreign currency denominated net revenues, costs and expenses. These income statement amounts are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period. To the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased net revenues, operating expenses and net income. Similarly, our net revenues, operating expenses and net income will decrease when the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies. A significant portion of our international net revenues, operating expenses and net income are denominated in Euros. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the U.S. dollar weakened against the Euro and our weighted average translation rate used to convert Euro denominated transactions into U.S. dollar equivalents, decreased by approximately 6% compared to the weighted average translation rate for the year ended December 31, 2001. This weighted average translation rate change for the Euro resulted in increased net revenues of approximately $11.0 million and increased operating expenses of approximately $5.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2002. We expect our international operations will continue to grow in significance as we develop and deploy our global marketplace. As a result, foreign currency fluctuations in future periods could become more significant or even have a negative impact on our net revenues and net income. 33 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Since inception, we have financed operations primarily from net cash generated from operating activities. In addition, we have obtained additional financing from the sale of preferred stock and warrants, proceeds from the exercise of those warrants, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings. During 2002, we were primarily financed by our income from operations and from the proceeds of stock option exercises. Net cash provided by operating activities was $100.1 million in 2000, $252.1 million in 2001, and $479.9 million in 2002. Net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from our net income, tax benefits on the exercise of stock options, non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and changes in assets and liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities was $206.1 million in 2000, $29.8 million in 2001, and $157.8 million in 2002. The primary use for invested cash in the periods presented was for purchases of property and equipment and acquisitions, net of proceeds from the sale of investments and assets. Net cash provided by financing activities was $86.0 million in 2000, $101.5 million in 2001, and $252.1 million in 2002. Net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of common stock associated with stock option exercises. Commitments and Contingencies Capital Expenditures We expect capital expenditures to approximate $200 million during 2003, without taking into account any acquisitions or costs associated with the potential purchase of additional office facilities, and consists primarily of hardware and software for our platform architecture, site operations and corporate information systems. In the event we purchase additional office facilities in 2003, our capital expenditures would be substantially larger. As of December 31, 2002, we have commitments to purchase a total of $28.8 million in computer equipment, software and related services from two vendors. In June 2002, we entered into an agreement to purchase computer equipment, software and related services to expand our data warehousing capabilities. Under the agreement we are obligated to pay a minimum of $16.0 million to a third party vendor during a 30 month period ending in December 2004. Minimum purchases under the commitment total $7.2 million in 2002, $4.5 million in 2003, and $4.3 million in 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we purchased $8.6 million under this contract. In December 2002, we entered into an agreement to purchase computer equipment, software and related services to further expand our platform architecture, site operations and corporate information systems. Under the agreement, we are obligated to pay a minimum of $20.0 million to a third party vendor during 2003. The commitment may include a maximum of $5.4 million in services purchases, and the remainder must consist of equipment and software purchases. The agreement automatically renews for additional one year periods through 2005, if we do not cancel the agreement at the conclusion of each year. In addition, this vendor amended an existing promotions agreement and has agreed to pay us $5.0 million in quarterly payments for promotion of its auctions on eBay.com in 2003 and to spend an additional $666,000 in joint promotions during the year. The promotions agreement, as amended, can be renewed with the mutual agreement of both parties for additional one year terms through 2005. Equipment, software and services purchases will be expensed or capitalized in accordance with our capitalization policy. Promotions will be recognized as transaction revenue over the period of delivery. 34 Table of Contents Leases On March 1, 2000, we entered into a five year lease for general office facilities located in San Jose, California. This five year lease is commonly referred to as a synthetic lease because it represents a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party funds 100% of the costs of the acquisition of the property and leases the asset to us as lessee. Under our lease structure, upon termination or expiration, at our option, we must either purchase the property from the lessor for a predetermined amount or sell the real property to a third party. Our San Jose lease consists of approximately 460,000 square feet of office space. As of December 31, 2002, we occupied approximately 314,000 square feet of this total office space and subleased additional space in the facility to third parties. Payments under our lease are based on the $126.4 million cost of the property funded by the third party and are adjusted as the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, fluctuates. Under the terms of the lease agreement, the lease terminates on March 1, 2005, unless extended to September 1, 2006. At any time prior to the final 12 months of the lease term, we may, at our option, purchase the property for approximately $126.4 million. If we elect not to purchase the property, we will undertake to sell the facility to one or more third parties and have guaranteed to the lessor a residual value equal to approximately 88% of the $126.4 million cost of the property. Our maximum exposure to loss is the entire amount of $126.4 million if we default on any of certain lease obligations and financial covenants. If this payment were made, we would then receive title to the property. At December 31, 2002, we had not made a decision with respect to the option we will pursue at the end of the lease term. Management believes that the contingent liability relating to the residual value guarantee will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we are required to maintain $126.4 million of cash and investment securities as collateral for the term of the lease and to maintain certain financial covenants. The cash and investment securities are restricted as to their withdrawal from a third party trustee and are classified as long term restricted cash and investments on our balance sheet. In the event of a default under the lease, the collateral could be used to pay the purchase price of the property and the lease would be terminated. At December 31, 2002, we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the lease. If our lease were terminated, and we became obligated to pay the purchase price of the land and buildings, we would show the cost as an asset on our balance sheet and our restricted cash and investments position would be reduced by the amount of the purchase price. Currently, we reflect rent payments as an operating expense on our statement of income. In the event we were required to purchase the land and buildings, our rent expense would cease and we would subsequently record depreciation expense for the buildings over their estimated useful lives. We entered into two interest rate swaps on June 19, 2000 and July 20, 2000, to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on a portion of the floating rate operating lease for our facilities. See Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 6 Derivative Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated by reference herein. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, addresses consolidation by business enterprises of certain variable interest entities where there is a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity or where the variable interest entity does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. This interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and applies in the first year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003 to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. We expect that the adoption of FIN 46 will require us to include our San Jose facilities lease and potentially certain investments in our Consolidated Financial Statements effective July 1, 2003. In connection with our San Jose facilities lease arrangement, our balance sheet following the July 1, 2003 adoption of FIN 46 will reflect changes to record assets of $126.4 million, liabilities of $122.5 million and non controlling interests of $3.9 million. In addition, our post adoption income statement will reflect the reclassification of rent 35 Table of Contents expense payments from operating expenses to interest expense as well as the recognition of depreciation expense, within operating expenses, for our use of the buildings. We estimate that the income statement impact of consolidating our San Jose facilities lease will consist of a charge against earnings, net of taxes, of $5.6 million upon the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. This charge will reflect the accumulated depreciation charges that would have been recorded in previous periods had consolidation of the San Jose facilities been required. Additionally, we have not decided whether we will keep the existing financing arrangement or purchase the San Jose facilities. Whether or not we keep the existing financing arrangement, we anticipate recording additional annual operating expenses of $1.7 million, net of taxes, for the recognition of depreciation expense on the buildings. In the event we purchase the San Jose facilities, we will also pay $126.4 million, eliminate financing payments and settle our two interest rate swaps we used to establish a fixed rate of interest for $95 million of our financing arrangement. During the year ended December 31, 2002, our financing payments related to the San Jose facilities totaled $7.9 million. At December 31, 2002, settlement of our two interest rate swaps would have resulted in a loss of $10.9 million. Our U.S. segment occupies approximately 434,000 square feet of commercial office space in the United States. We occupy 314,000 square feet of commercial office space in San Jose, California under the terms of our synthetic lease for our corporate headquarters. We own and occupy approximately 72,000 square feet of commercial office space in Salt Lake City, Utah for our domestic customer support center. We lease and occupy an additional 48,000 square feet of commercial office space in various domestic locations for the operations of certain U.S. subsidiaries. Our International segment leases approximately 210,000 square feet of commercial office space in 12 countries for our international operations, including the operations of our South Korean majority owned subsidiary. Our Payments segment leases approximately 126,000 square feet of commercial office space in the United States and the United Kingdom. In addition, our Payments segment owns approximately 22 acres of land near Omaha, Nebraska, on which a 115,000 square foot facility is under construction. Upon completion, this facility will house the primary customer service operations center for our Payments segment. We also have lease obligations under certain other non cancelable operating leases. Future minimum rental payments under all non cancelable operating leases, exclusive of the residual value guarantee on our general office facilities located in San Jose, California, at December 31, 2002 are as follows (in thousands): Year Ending Operating December 31, Leases 2003 $ 16,410 2004 17,056 2005 9,630 2006 7,568 2007 6,108 Thereafter 19,909 Total minimum lease payments $ 76,681 36 Table of Contents Minimum annual repayments on notes payable and capital leases at December 31, 2002 are as follows (in thousands): Year ending December 31, Total 2003 $ 4,145 2004 2,513 2005 1,478 2006 616 2007 Thereafter 9,192 $ 17,944 Marketing Agreements From time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we enter into arrangements to purchase online and offline promotions. Such arrangements typically involve minimum purchase commitments with terms ranging from several months to five years. AOL interactive marketing agreement In April 2002, we amended our Interactive Marketing Agreement with AOL Time Warner, Inc., or AOL. AOL attained certain performance goals in the contract year ending March 23, 2003, and extended the amended agreement for an additional year, through March 23, 2004. Under the terms of the amended agreement, we will pay AOL for its advertising services on a new user performance basis, up to a maximum of $15 million. We are recognizing these fees as sales and marketing expense as such services are provided. From time to time, we have also entered into incremental, discretionary purchases of advertising from AOL. Discretionary purchases totaled $1.4 million during 2000, $8.5 million during 2001, and $7.6 million during 2002. In the event that AOLs advertising services during the year achieve certain specified performance goals, AOL has the right to extend the term of the amended agreement through March 23, 2005. Our financial obligation for this renewal year, if any, will also be determined on a new user performance basis and will amount to a maximum of $10.0 million. Disney marketing agreement In February 2000, we entered a four year marketing agreement with The Walt Disney Company, or Disney, to provide us with online and offline advertising and promotions and develop a co branded version of our online service. Subject to certain Disney performance obligations, we were obligated to pay a minimum of $30 million to Disney over the four year term of the agreement. In August 2001, we amended the terms of the initial agreement and agreed to purchase a minimum of $23.0 million in online and offline promotions through September 2004. We also committed to provide Disney with online advertising on the eBay.com website valued at $3.5 million. Through December 31, 2002, we have recognized $16.9 million in sales and marketing expense associated with the amended agreement. Microsoft marketing and services agreements During 2001, we entered into a series of marketing and services agreements with Microsoft that obligate us to purchase online advertising promotions, software and related services through September 2003, totaling $8 million. In addition, Microsoft has agreed to purchase online advertising and other services from us totaling $7 million over a three year period ending June 2004. Through December 31, 2002, we have recognized $4.3 million in sales and marketing expenses for advertising services received, 37 Table of Contents incurred $3.0 million for Microsoft software products used to support our operations and recognized $5.4 million in revenues for advertising services delivered to Microsoft. Subsequent Events Vancouver Lease In February 2003, we entered into an operating sublease for approximately 110,000 square feet of commercial office space in Vancouver, British Columbia for a customer support center. The sublease commences on July 1, 2003 and ends on October 30, 2011. Rental commitments under the sublease total $11.8 million, including operating costs and taxes. In addition, we are subleasing approximately 37,000 square feet of the leased space back to the prime lessee for substantially the same lease term. The prime lessees rental commitments to eBay under the sublease total $5.2 million, including operating costs and taxes. The prime lessee has provided an irrevocable letter of credit for $7.8 million as security for their obligations under this sublease arrangement. The commitment under our sublease, as well as the prime lessees sublease and letter of credit, are denominated in Canadian dollars. The dollar figures above are in U.S. dollars, converted from Canadian dollars at the exchange rate as of December 31, 2002. Integration of Half.com Platform In March 2003, we announced our intention to fully integrate the platform of Half.com, a wholly owned subsidiary acquired in July 2000, with the eBay.com platform by the end of 2004. Half.coms office in Pennsylvania, where 65 of its employees work, will be shut down once this process is complete. Management is in the process of formalizing an exit and integration plan and expects to finalize the plan by the end of 2003. Based on our preliminary estimates, we anticipate costs related to employee retention and severance will total approximately $3 million. If we decide to exit Halfs leased office facility, the amount of lease termination costs, excluding any possible sublease income, and fixed asset write offs will total approximately $2 million. Costs related to our exit plan will be recorded as charges on our income statement over the exit and integration period in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. PayPals Prior Services to Online Gambling Merchants PayPal completed its exit from the business of processing payments for online gambling merchants in November 2002. Approximately 6% of PayPals revenues in 2002 were derived from this business. Beginning in July 2002, PayPal provided documents and information related to its services to online gambling merchants in response to a federal grand jury subpoena issued at the request of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. On March 28, 2003, PayPal received a letter from the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri indicating its contention that PayPals provision of services to online gambling merchants violated 18 U.S.C. 1960 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which prohibits the transmission of funds that are known to have been derived from a criminal offense or are intended to be used to promote or support unlawful activity, thereby subjecting PayPal to potential civil forfeiture of the amounts it received in connection with such activities as well as potential criminal liability. The letter offered a complete settlement of all possible claims and charges from the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri if Paypal paid the purported amount of its earnings derived from online gambling merchants during the nine month period from October 26, 2001 to July 31, 2002, plus interest. PayPal acted in the good faith belief that its conduct did not violate 18 U.S.C. 1960 and PayPal calculates that the amount of its earnings from online gaming activities was less than asserted in the letter. Although the outcome of this matter is not yet determinable, the monetary amounts associated with this matter are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. General We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, together with any cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other 38 Table of Contents obligations for the foreseeable future. However, if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flows from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, our business could suffer. Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates The following description of critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2002. Senior management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors regularly review the appropriateness of the methodologies and estimates used in connection with the application of our critical accounting policies. Provisions for Doubtful Accounts and Authorized Credits Our U.S. and International segments are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and credits to sellers. Provisions for these items represent our estimate of actual losses and credits based on our historical experience, are monitored monthly, and are made at the time the related revenue is recognized. The provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to operating expense, while the provision for authorized credits is recorded as a reduction of revenues. The following table illustrates the provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a percentage of net revenues for 2000, 2001, and 2002 (in thousands, except percents). 2000 2001 2002 Net revenues from the U.S. and International segments $ 426,385 $ 731,173 $ 1,118,732 Provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits 18,237 25,243 25,455 Provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a % of net revenues from the U.S. and International segments 4.3% 3.5% 2.3% Historically, our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions. However, unexpected or significant future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future statements of income and cash flows. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2002, a 25 basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in expense and or net revenues of approximately $3 million. The following analysis demonstrates the potential effect a 25 basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands, except per share data): Managements 25 Basis 2002 +25 Basis Points Estimate Points Provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits $ 22,934 $ 25,455 $ 28,528 Income from operations 356,718 354,197 351,124 Net income 251,482 249,891 247,951 Diluted earnings per share 0.86 0.85 0.85 Provision for Transaction Losses Our Payments segment is exposed to transaction losses due to fraud, as well as non performance of third parties and customers. We establish allowances for estimated losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as charge backs for unauthorized credit card use and merchant related charge backs due to non delivery of goods or services, ACH returns, and debit card overdrafts. These allowances represent an accumulation of the estimated amounts, using an actuarial technique, necessary to provide for 39 Table of Contents transaction losses incurred as of the reporting date, including those to which we have not yet been notified. The allowances are monitored monthly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors. Customers typically have up to 180 days to file transaction disputes. Consequently, the time between estimating the loss provisions and realization of the actual amount is short. The allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including our experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types. Additions to the allowance, in the form of provisions, are reflected as a general and administrative expense in our results of operations, while write offs to the allowance are made when a loss is determined to have occurred. Recoveries, when collected, are recorded as an increase to the allowance for transaction losses. As of December 31, 2002, the allowance for transaction losses totaled $10.1 million and was included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The following table illustrates the provision for transaction losses as a percentage of total payment volume from PayPal operations for the post acquisition period from October 4, 2002 through December 31, 2002 (in thousands, except percents). 2002 Total Payment Volume from the PayPal operations $ 2,138,093 Provision for transaction losses 7,832 Provision for transaction losses as a % of total payment volume from PayPal operations 0.37% Prior to our October 3, 2002 acquisition of PayPal, no provision for transaction losses was recorded as our third party banking service provider assumed all transaction loss exposure. The fees charged to us by this banking service provider reflected the assumption of this loss exposure and other services rendered. Charges for the services were reported as a cost of net revenues. The establishment of appropriate allowances for transaction losses is an inherently uncertain process, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date. Based on our results for the post acquisition period from October 4, 2002 through December 31, 2002, a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in expense of approximately $1.0 million. The following analysis demonstrates the potential effect a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our financial statements for the period that we consolidated PayPals operations and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands, except per share data): Managements 5 Basis 2002 +5 Basis Points Estimate Points Provision for transaction losses $ 6,842 $ 7,832 $ 8,980 Income from operations 355,187 354,197 353,049 Net income 250,516 249,891 249,166 Diluted earnings per share 0.86 0.85 0.85 Legal Contingencies In connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our income statement. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events. 40 Table of Contents From time to time, we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we do not expect this trend to change in the future. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in Item 3: Legal Proceedings and Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies Litigation to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated by reference herein. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us, and we will defend ourselves vigorously. However, even if successful, our defense against certain actions will be costly and could divert our managements time. If the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims, we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our U.S. business. Any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of each of our three segments. Accounting for Income Taxes We are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon the taxable income and temporary differences for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws around the world and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities, including various accruals, allowances, depreciation and amortization. The tax effect of these temporary differences and the estimated tax benefit from our tax net operating losses are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion of or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our tax provision in our income statement. Where the change in the valuation allowance relates to the deduction for employee stock option exercises, the change is reflected as a credit to additional paid in capital. As employee stock option exercises are highly dependent upon the performance of our stock price, it is extremely difficult to predict the amount of deductions that will be generated from future option exercises and, therefore, it is difficult for us to ascertain the amount of deferred tax assets related to employee stock option exercises that may be realized in future periods. We have consequently provided a valuation allowance equal to 100% of our deferred tax assets related to employee stock option exercises. The deferred tax asset, net of a valuation allowance of $145.2 million, totaled $100.2 million at December 31, 2002. The following table illustrates the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes for 2000, 2001, and 2002 (in thousands, except percents): 2000 2001 2002 Income before income taxes $ 81,019 $ 170,457 $ 395,837 Provision for income taxes 32,725 80,009 145,946 Provision for income taxes as a % of income before income taxes 40% 47% 37% Historically, these provisions have adequately provided for our actual income tax liabilities. However, unexpected or significant future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future statements of income and cash flows. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2002, a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in expense of approximately $4.0 million. The following analysis demonstrates the potential effect such a one percentage point deviation change would have upon our financial statements 41 Table of Contents and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands, except per share data): Managements 2002 1% Estimate +1% Provision for income taxes $ 142,105 $ 145,946 $ 150,022 Income before income taxes 395,837 395,837 395,837 Net income 253,732 249,891 245,815 Diluted earnings per share 0.87 0.85 0.84 Third party Advertising Revenues Our third party advertising revenues are derived principally from the sale of online banner and sponsorship advertisements for cash and through barter arrangements. To date, the duration of our banner and sponsorship advertising contracts has ranged from one week to three years, but is generally one week to three months. Advertising revenues on both banner and sponsorship contracts are recognized as impressions (i.e., the number of times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of our websites) are delivered or ratably over the term of the agreement where such agreements provide for minimum monthly or quarterly advertising commitments or where such commitments are fixed throughout the term. Barter transactions are valued based on amounts realized in similar cash transactions occurring within six months prior to the date of the barter transaction. To the extent that significant delivery obligations remain at the end of a period or collection of the resulting account receivable is not considered probable, revenues are deferred until the obligation is satisfied or the uncertainty is resolved. These amounts are included in deferred revenue in our balance sheet. Third party advertising net revenues, including barter transactions, totaled 3%, 11% and 5% of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively and were primarily from our U.S. segment. Revenue from barter arrangements totaled $2.5 million in 2000, $10.4 million in 2001, and $10.1 million in 2002. Third party advertising revenues may be affected by the financial condition of our customers and by the success of online promotions in general. Recently, the industry pricing of online advertisements has deteriorated. Our third party advertising revenue is dependent in significant part on the performance of AOL Time Warner, Inc., or AOL, over which we do not have control. Reduction in third party advertising, whether due to softening of the demand for online advertising in general or particular problems facing parties with whom we have contractual arrangements, would adversely affect our operating results. Unlike our transaction revenues, third party advertising revenues are derived from a highly concentrated customer base. During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, third party advertising revenues were all attributable to approximately 20 customers each year. During the year ended December 31, 2002, third party advertising revenues were all derived from approximately 30 customers. We continue to view our business as primarily transaction driven and we expect third party advertising revenues in future periods to decrease as a percentage of total net revenues, and in absolute dollars. Additionally, our advertising sales representative agreement with AOL has not been extended or renewed and is scheduled to terminate on March 31, 2003, with AOL to continue its electronic delivery of our online advertisements for a specified wind down period. After March 31, 2003, our third party advertising revenues will be dependent on the efforts of our existing internal sales staff. End to End Services Revenues Our end to end services revenues are derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide transaction services to eBay users. To date, the duration of our end to end services contracts has ranged from one to three years. End to end services revenues are recognized as the contracted services are delivered to end users. To the extent that significant obligations remain at the end of a period or collection of the resulting receivable is not considered probable, revenues are deferred until 42 Table of Contents the obligation is satisfied or the uncertainty is resolved. End to end services net revenues were 7%, 4% and 2% of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively and were primarily from our U.S. segment. Similar to our third party advertising revenues, our end to end services revenues may be affected by the financial condition of the parties with whom we have these relationships and by the success of online services and promotions in general. Additionally, end to end services revenues are also concentrated among a small customer base. End to end services revenues were derived from approximately 10 customers in 2000 and from approximately 20 customers in each of 2001 and 2002. We continue to view our business as primarily transaction driven and expect end to end services revenues in future periods to decrease as a percentage of total net revenues and in absolute dollars. Impairment of Long Lived Assets, Goodwill and Investments Our long lived assets at December 31, 2002 are property and equipment of $218.0 million and other intangible assets of $279.5 million. We evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value. We assess the recoverability of our long lived and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted future net cash flows using a discount rate reflecting our average cost of capital. Our goodwill at December 31, 2002 totaled $1.46 billion. We evaluate goodwill, at a minimum, on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies data. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. To date, we have recorded no impairment of property and equipment, goodwill, or intangible assets. However, if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges in any or all of our three segments to reduce the carrying amount of these assets. The fair value of long term investments are dependent on the performance of the companies and instruments in which we have invested, as well as the volatility inherent in external markets for these investments. In assessing potential impairment, we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the companies in which we invest. If forecasted performance levels are not met or if other events occur, we may have to record additional impairment charges in our U.S. and International segments to reduce the carrying amount of these assets. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized $3.8 million of impairment losses relating to the impairment in value of certain equity investments. At December 31, 2002, the total value of our equity investments in unconsolidated companies was $44.2 million, with $4.9 million in our U.S segment, $37.5 million in our International segment, and none in our Payments segment. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 or SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which nullifies Emerging 43 Table of Contents Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and states that an entitys commitment to an exit plan, by itself, does not create a present obligation that meets the definition of a liability. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 146 to have a material impact upon our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize a liability for obligations it has undertaken in relation to the issuance of a guarantee. It requires that the liability be recorded at fair value on the date that the guarantee is issued. It also requires a guarantor to provide additional disclosures regarding guarantees, including the nature of the guarantee, the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee, the carrying amount of the liability, if any, for the guarantors obligations under the guarantee, and the nature and extent of any recourse provisions or available collateral that would enable the guarantor to recover the amounts paid under the guarantee. The disclosure requirements under FIN 45 are effective for the interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The recognition and measurement provisions under FIN 45 are effective for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of FIN 45 to have a material impact upon our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. See Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated by reference herein. Accounting for Stock Based Compensation In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS 148 provides two additional transition methods for entities that voluntarily adopt the fair value method of recording expenses when accounting for stock based compensation. Further, the statement requires disclosure of comparable information for all companies regardless of whether, when, or how an entity adopts the preferable, fair value based method of accounting. These disclosures are now required for interim periods in addition to the traditional annual disclosure. The amendments to SFAS No. 123, which provides for additional transition methods, are effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The disclosure provisions are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and have been incorporated into the notes to the accompanying financial statements. We have chosen not to voluntarily adopt the fair value method of accounting for employee stock option grants at this time. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, addresses consolidation by business enterprises of certain variable interest entities where there is a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity or where the variable interest entity does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. This interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and applies in the first year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003 to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. We expect that the adoption of FIN 46 will require us to include our San Jose facilities lease arrangement and potentially certain investments in our Consolidated Financial Statements effective July 1, 2003. In connection with our San Jose facilities lease arrangement, our balance sheet following the July 1, 2003 adoption of FIN 46 will reflect changes to record assets of $126.4 million, liabilities of $122.5 million and non controlling 44 Table of Contents interests of $3.9 million. In addition, our post adoption income statement will reflect the reclassification of rent expense payments from operating expenses to interest expense as well as the recognition of depreciation expense, within operating expenses, for our use of the buildings. We estimate that the income statement impact of consolidating our San Jose facilities lease will consist of a charge against earnings, net of taxes, of $5.6 million upon the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. This charge will reflect the accumulated depreciation charges that would have been recorded in previous periods had consolidation of the San Jose facilities been required. Additionally, we have not decided whether we will keep the existing financing arrangement or purchase the San Jose facilities. Whether or not we keep the existing financing arrangement, we anticipate recording additional annual operating expenses of $1.7 million, net of taxes, to for the recognition of depreciation expense on the buildings. In the event we purchase the San Jose facilities, we will also pay $126.4 million, eliminate financing payments and settle our two interest rate swaps we used to establish a fixed rate of interest for $95 million of our financing arrangement. During the year ended December 31, 2002, our financing payments related to the San Jose facilities totaled $7.9 million. At December 31, 2002, settlement of our two interest rate swaps would have resulted in a loss of $10.9 million. 45 Table of Contents Risk Factors That May Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing eBay. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or such other risks actually occur, our business could be harmed. Our operating results may fluctuate. Our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following: our ability to retain an active user base, to attract new users who list items for sale, who purchase items through our service or who use our payment services and to maintain customer satisfaction; our ability to keep our websites operational at a reasonable cost; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses, operations and infrastructure; foreign, federal, state or local government regulation, including investigations prompted by items listed, sold or paid for by our users; our ability to comply with the requirements of entities whose services are required for our operations, such as the credit card associations; the success of our geographical and product expansion; the introduction of new sites, services and products by us or our competitors; volume, size, timing and completion rate of transactions on our websites; consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions on our websites; our ability to upgrade and develop our systems, infrastructure and customer service capabilities to accommodate growth at a reasonable cost; our ability to develop product enhancements at reasonable cost; our ability to integrate successfully and cost effectively manage our acquisitions, including the acquisition of PayPal; our ability to manage fraud loss and credit card charge back rates and the payment funding mix at PayPal; the cost and demand for advertising on our websites; technical difficulties or service interruptions involving our websites or services provided to our users by third parties (such as photo hosting); our ability to attract new personnel in a timely and effective manner; our ability to retain key employees in our online businesses, including PayPal; our ability to expand our product offerings involving fixed price trading successfully; the costs and results of litigation that involves us; the results of regulatory decisions that affect us; the timing, cost and availability of advertising in traditional media and on other websites and online services; 46 Table of Contents the timing of payments to us and of marketing and other expenses under existing and future contracts; the success of our brand building and marketing campaigns; the continued financial strength of our commercial partners and technology suppliers; the level of use of the Internet and online services; increasing consumer acceptance of the Internet and other online services for commerce and, in particular, for the trading of products such as those listed on our websites; general economic conditions and those economic conditions specific to the Internet and e commerce industries; and geopolitical events such as war, threat of war or terrorist actions. Our limited operating history and the increased variety of services offered on our websites makes it difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings accurately. We believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. We do not have backlog, and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales or payments during that quarter. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues it is also difficult to forecast income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline. We may not maintain our level of profitability. We believe that our continued profitability at historical levels will depend in large part on our ability to do the following: maintain sufficient transaction volume to attract buyers and sellers; manage the costs of our business, including the costs associated with maintaining and developing our websites, customer support, fraud and chargebacks and international and product expansion; increase the awareness of our brands; and provide our customers with superior community and trading experiences. We are investing heavily in marketing and promotion, customer support, further development of our websites, technology and operating infrastructure development. The costs of these investments are expected to remain significant into the future. In addition, many of our acquisitions require continuing investments in these areas and we have significant ongoing contractual commitments in some of these areas. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall, which may harm our profitability. The existence of several larger and more established companies that are enabling online sales as well as other companies, some of whom do not charge for transactions on their sites and others who are facilitating trading through varied pricing formats (e.g., fixed price, reverse auction, group buying) may limit our ability to raise user fees in response to declines in profitability. In addition, we are spending in advance of anticipated growth, which may also harm our profitability. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history, we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful. You should not rely upon our historical results as indications of our future performance. Our integration of PayPal may be difficult. While eBay has acquired smaller companies in the past, the acquisition of PayPal represents by far the largest acquisition by eBay to date. We expect that the process of integrating PayPals business into 47 Table of Contents the eBay platform, and pursuing opportunities for PayPals growth outside of the eBay platform, will be relatively difficult and will require significant attention from management. This may divert managements attention from its focus on eBays principal business for an extended period of time. In addition, PayPal will continue to operate as an independent wholly owned subsidiary of eBay. Because PayPal will be relatively independent, efficient cooperation between eBay and PayPal following the merger will be crucial for a successful integration of PayPals business into the eBay platform. PayPals pre merger Chief Executive Officer left the company at the time the merger was consummated and the pre merger Chief Technical Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer left the company shortly thereafter. Accordingly, PayPals new Chief Executive Officer and certain other members of its management have only limited experience with PayPal. There can be no assurance that PayPals business will be integrated into the eBay platform in a timely and efficient manner or that any of the anticipated benefits of the merger will be realized. If these benefits are not realized, our business and operating results will be harmed. Our business is adversely affected by anything that causes our users to spend less time on their computers, including national events and seasonal factors. Anything that diverts our users from their customary level of usage of our websites could adversely affect our business. We would therefore be adversely affected by geopolitical events such as war, the threat of war or terrorist activity. Similarly, our results of operations historically have been seasonal in nature because many of our users reduce their activities on our websites during the holidays, such as during the Thanksgiving (in the U.S.) and Christmas periods, and with the onset of good weather during the summer months. We have historically experienced our strongest quarters of online growth in our first and fourth fiscal quarters. PayPal has shown similar seasonality, except that its strongest quarter of online growth has historically been the fourth fiscal quarter. There are many risks associated with our international operations. Our international expansion has been rapid and we have only limited experience in many of the countries in which we now do business. Our international business, especially in Germany, the U.K., Canada and Korea, has also become critical to our revenues and profits. Expansion into international markets requires management attention and resources. We have limited experience in localizing our service to conform to local cultures, standards and policies. In many countries, we compete with local companies who understand the local market better than we do. We may not be successful in expanding into particular international markets or in generating revenues from foreign operations. For example, in 2002 we withdrew from the Japanese market. Even if we are successful, the costs of operating new sites are expected to exceed our net revenues for at least 12 months in most countries. As we continue to expand internationally, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including the following: regulatory requirements, including regulation of auctioneering, banking, and money transmitting, that may limit or prevent the offering of our services in some jurisdictions, may prevent enforceable agreements between sellers and buyers, may prohibit certain categories of goods, may require special licensure, or may limit the transfer of information between our foreign subsidiaries and ourselves; legal uncertainty regarding liability for the listings of our users, including less Internet friendly legal systems, unique local laws and lack of clear precedent or applicable law; different employee/employer relationships and the existence of workers councils and labor unions; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; longer payment cycles, different accounting practices and greater problems in collecting accounts receivable; potentially adverse tax consequences, including local taxation of our fees or of transactions on our websites; 48 Table of Contents higher telecommunications and Internet service provider costs; strong local competitors; more stringent consumer and data protection laws; cultural ambivalence to, or non acceptance of, online trading; seasonal reductions in business activity; expenses associated with localizing our products, including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency; laws and business practices that favor local competitors; profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations; changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions; and differing intellectual property laws. Some of these factors may cause our international costs to exceed our domestic costs of doing business. To the extent we expand our international operations and have additional portions of our international revenues denominated in foreign currencies, we also could become subject to increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We intend to expand PayPals services internationally. Both we and PayPal have limited experience with the payments business outside of the U.S. In addition to all of the factors listed above, we expect that successful international expansion of PayPals business will require successful integration with local payment providers (including banks, credit and debit card associations, electronic fund transfer systems and others) and in some countries may require a close commercial relationship with a local bank. We do not know if these or other factors may prevent, delay or limit PayPals expansion or reduce its profitability. Any limitation on our ability to expand PayPal internationally could harm our business. Our business may be subject to sales and other taxes. We do not collect sales or other similar taxes on goods or services sold by users through our services. One or more states or any foreign country may seek to impose value added taxes, or VAT, or sales or use tax collection or record keeping obligations on companies such as ours that engage in or facilitate online commerce. Such taxes could be imposed if, for example, we were ever deemed to be an auctioneer or the agent of our sellers. Several proposals have been made at the state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services through the Internet. These proposals, if adopted, could substantially impair the growth of e commerce, and could diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities. In 1998, the U.S. federal government enacted legislation prohibiting states or other local authorities from imposing new taxes on Internet commerce for a period of three years, which has been extended through November 1, 2003. This moratorium does not prohibit states or the Internal Revenue Service from collecting taxes on our income, if any, or from collecting taxes that are due under existing tax rules. New regulations in the European Union relating to the collection of VAT on digital services will require us to collect and remit VAT on our own fees beginning in July 2003. We intend to work with relevant tax authorities to clarify our obligations under these regulations and to change our software to permit the billing of these taxes. We expect substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the VAT rules throughout Europe and the increased cost to our users may reduce their activity on our websites. Both of these effects could adversely affect our business. A successful assertion by one or more states or any foreign country that we should collect sales or other taxes on the exchange of merchandise on our system would harm our business. 49 Table of Contents PayPal is subject to unique risks that could harm our business. PayPal faces significant risks of loss due to fraud and disputes between senders and recipients. If PayPal is unable to deal effectively with fraudulent transactions, PayPals losses from fraud would increase, and its business would be harmed. PayPal faces significant risks of loss due to fraud and disputes between senders and recipients, including: unauthorized use of credit card and bank account information and identity theft; merchant fraud and other disputes over the quality of goods and services; potential breaches of system security; potential employee fraud; and use of PayPals system by customers to make or accept payment for illegal or improper purposes. For the years ended December 31, 2001, and December 31, 2002, PayPals provision for transaction losses totaled $14.8 million and $28.8 million, respectively, representing 0.42% and 0.41% of PayPals total payment volume. In January 2003 PayPal increased the withdrawal limit for unverified international users to $500 per month in certain countries. This increase may result in higher transaction losses. PayPal incurs chargebacks and other losses from merchant fraud, payment disputes and insufficient funds, and its liability from these items could have a material adverse effect on its business and result in PayPal losing the right to accept credit cards for payment. If PayPal is prohibited from accepting credit cards for payment, its ability to compete could be impaired, and our business would suffer. PayPal incurs substantial losses from merchant fraud, including claims from customers that merchants have not performed, that their goods or services do not match the merchants description or that the customer did not authorize the purchase. PayPal also incurs losses from erroneous transmissions and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments. PayPals liability for such items could have a material adverse effect on its business, and if they become excessive, could result in PayPal losing the right to accept credit cards for payment. If PayPal were unable to accept credit cards, the velocity of trade on eBay could decrease, in which case our business would suffer. PayPal has been assessed substantial fines in the past, and excessive chargebacks may arise in the future. PayPal has taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures may not be effective. If these measures do not succeed, our business will suffer. Unauthorized use of credit cards and bank accounts could expose PayPal to substantial losses. If PayPal is unable to detect and prevent unauthorized use of cards and bank accounts, its business would suffer. The highly automated nature of, and liquidity offered by, PayPals payment product makes PayPal an attractive target for fraud. In configuring its product, PayPal faces an inherent trade off between customer convenience and security. Identity thieves and those committing fraud using stolen credit card or bank account numbers, often in bulk and in conjunction with automated mechanisms of online communication, potentially can steal large amounts of money from businesses such as PayPals. PayPal believes that several of PayPals current and former competitors in the electronic payments business have gone out of business or significantly restricted their businesses largely due to losses from this type of fraud. PayPal expects that technically knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent PayPals anti fraud systems. If they are successful, our business will be harmed. 50 Table of Contents PayPals processes to reduce fraud losses depend in part on its ability to restrict the withdrawal of customer funds while it investigates suspicious transactions. PayPal has been and could be sued by plaintiffs alleging that PayPals restriction and investigation processes violate federal and state law on consumer protection and unfair business practice, and are inconsistent with PayPals user agreement. If PayPal is unable to defend itself successfully, it could be required to restructure its anti fraud processes in ways that would harm its business, and to pay substantial damages. As part of PayPals program to reduce fraud losses, it may temporarily restrict the ability of customers to withdraw their funds if those funds or their account activity are identified by PayPals anti fraud models as suspicious. PayPal is subject to several purported class action lawsuits challenging its procedures and disclosures with respect to suspicious accounts (See Item 3: Legal Proceedings), and if PayPals processes are found to violate federal or state law on consumer protection and unfair business practices, it could be subject to an enforcement action or fines. If PayPal loses this litigation or is subject to an enforcement action, it could be required to restructure its anti fraud processes in ways that would harm its business, and to pay substantial damages. Even if PayPal is able to defend itself successfully, the litigation or enforcement action could cause damage to its reputation, could consume substantial amounts of its managements time and attention, and could require PayPal to change its customer service and operations in ways that could increase its costs and decrease the effectiveness of its anti fraud program. Any failure to provide effective customer support could result in the loss of customers and inability to attract new customers, which would harm PayPals business. Because it is providing a financial service and operating in a more regulated environment, PayPal, unlike eBay, must provide telephone as well as email customer service, and must resolve certain customer contacts within shorter time frames. PayPal has received negative publicity with respect to its customer service and is the subject of purported class action lawsuits alleging, among other things, failure to resolve promptly certain account restrictions. If PayPal is unable to provide quality customer support operations in a cost effective manner, its users may have negative experiences, PayPal may receive additional negative publicity and its ability to attract new customers may be damaged. Current and future revenues could suffer, or its operating margins may decrease. In addition, negative publicity about or experiences with PayPals customer support could cause eBays reputation to suffer or affect consumer confidence in eBay as a whole. Security and privacy breaches in PayPals electronic transactions may expose PayPal to additional liability and result in the loss of customers, either of which events could harm its business. Any inability on PayPals part to protect the security and privacy of its electronic transactions could have a material adverse effect on its profitability. A security or privacy breach could: expose PayPal to additional liability; increase PayPals expenses relating to resolution of these breaches; and deter customers from using PayPals product. PayPals data security measures may not effectively counter evolving security risks or address the security and privacy concerns of existing and potential customers. Any failures in PayPals security and privacy measures could have a material adverse effect on our business. PayPal could incur substantial losses from employee fraud and, as a result, its business would suffer. The large volume of payments that PayPal handles for its customers makes it vulnerable to employee fraud or other internal security breaches. PayPal is required to reimburse customers for any funds stolen as a result of such breaches. We cannot assure you that PayPals internal security systems will prevent material losses from employee fraud. 51 Table of Contents PayPals payment system might be used for illegal or improper purposes, which could expose it to additional liability and harm its business. Despite measures PayPal has taken to detect and prevent identity theft, unauthorized uses of credit cards and similar misconduct, its payment system remains susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses. These may include illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, software and other intellectual property piracy, money laundering, bank fraud, child pornography trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products and online securities fraud. Despite measures PayPal has taken to detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct, these measures may not succeed. The processing of these payments could expose PayPal to liability. In addition, future regulations under the USA PATRIOT Act may require PayPal to revise the procedures it takes to verify the identity of customers and to monitor more closely international transactions. PayPals business could suffer if customers use its system for illegal or improper purposes, or if usage of its system is reduced because of increased verification requirements. PayPals discontinuance of its processing of payments for online gambling merchants will reduce its revenue and profits; its past processing of these accounts could subject it to liability. PayPal completed its exit from the business of processing payments for online gambling merchants in November 2002. Approximately 6% of PayPals revenues in 2002 were derived from this business. The loss of these revenues and related profits will adversely affect PayPals financial results. As a result of having been in this business, PayPal has become subject to two inquiries related to payments made through its service to online gambling merchants. In August 2002, PayPal reached agreement with the Attorney General of the State of New York that it would cease processing payments from its New York members to such merchants and pay the State of New York $200,000 in penalties and disgorged profits and to cover the cost of investigation. Beginning in July 2002, PayPal provided documents and information related to its services to online gambling merchants in response to a federal grand jury subpoena issued at the request of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. On March 28, 2003, PayPal received a letter from the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri indicating its contention that PayPals provision of services to online gambling merchants violated 18 U.S.C. 1960 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which prohibits the transmission of funds that are known to have been derived from a criminal offense or are intended to be used to promote or support unlawful activity, thereby subjecting PayPal to potential civil forfeiture of the amounts it received in connection with such activities as well as potential criminal liability. The letter offered a complete settlement of all possible claims and charges from the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri if Paypal paid the purported amount of its earnings derived from online gambling merchants during the nine month period from October 26, 2001 to July 31, 2002, plus interest. PayPal acted in the good faith belief that its conduct did not violate 18 U.S.C. 1960 and PayPal calculates that the amount of its earnings from online gaming activities was less than asserted in the letter. Should this investigation lead to a civil or criminal charge against PayPal, we would be harmed by negative publicity, the cost of litigation and the diversion of management time, even if PayPal ultimately prevails. Any finding of a civil or criminal violation by PayPal, or potentially any settlement, could also endanger PayPals ability to obtain, maintain or renew money transmitter licenses in jurisdictions where it requires such licenses to operate, which would materially harm our business. Changes to card association rules or practices could negatively affect PayPals service and, if it does not comply with the rules, could result in a termination of PayPals ability to accept credit cards. If PayPal is unable to accept credit cards, our business would suffer. Because PayPal is not a bank, it cannot belong to and directly access the Visa and MasterCard credit card associations or the Automated Clearing House, or ACH, payment network. As a result, PayPal must rely on banks and their service providers to process its transactions. PayPal must comply with the operating rules of the credit card associations and the National Automated Clearing House Association, or NACHA, as they apply to merchants. The associations member banks set these rules, and the associations interpret the rules. Some of those member banks compete with PayPal. Visa, MasterCard, 52 Table of Contents American Express or Discover could adopt new operating rules or interpretations of existing rules which PayPal or its processors might find difficult or even impossible to comply with, in which case PayPal could lose its ability to give customers the option of using credit cards to fund their payments. If PayPal were unable to accept credit cards, its business would be seriously damaged. In addition, if PayPal were unable to accept credit cards, the velocity of trade on eBay could decrease and our business would suffer. MasterCard has announced that a clarification of its rules, effective May 1, 2002, requires each commercial customer that regularly uses PayPal to accept payment for goods or services, to enter into a contract directly with the bank that processes MasterCard transactions for PayPal and to agree to observe MasterCard rules. PayPal is complying with this rule through changes to its User Agreement, its internal processes, its contractual relationship with its credit card processor, and by obtaining additional information about its larger customers. As a result, PayPal has changed the interrelationship among itself, its larger customers and its credit card processing bank in ways that will increase PayPals costs and may reduce the attractiveness of its service. In 2001, Visa indicated that some of PayPals practices violated its operating rules, and PayPal implemented changes in response. In January 2002, PayPal received correspondence through its credit card processor that three issues remained unresolved. These issues relate to PayPals international membership fees, its fees for international credit card funded payments, and its process for obtaining authorization to charge a customers Visa account if the customers ACH transfer fails. In connection with these issues, PayPals processor was assessed fines totaling $130,000 by Visa in 2002, $110,000 of which PayPals processor has passed through to PayPal. PayPal has implemented changes to its practices to resolve these issues, and believes these changes have resolved all outstanding issues that resulted in compliance fines from Visa. However, these changes could make the PayPal service less attractive to its customers. PayPals status under state, federal and international financial services regulation is unclear. Violation of or compliance with present or future regulation could be costly, expose PayPal to substantial liability, force PayPal to change its business practices or force PayPal to cease offering its current product. PayPal operates in an industry subject to government regulation. PayPal currently is subject to some states money transmitter regulations, to federal regulations in its role as transfer agent and investment adviser to the PayPal Money Market Fund, and to federal electronic fund transfer and money laundering regulations. In the future, PayPal might be subjected to: state or federal banking regulations; additional states money transmitter regulations and federal money laundering regulations; international banking or financial services regulations or laws governing other regulated industries; or U.S. and international regulation of Internet transactions. If PayPal is found to be in violation of any current or future regulations, PayPal could be: exposed to financial liability, including substantial fines which could be imposed on a per transaction basis and disgorgement of its profits; forced to change its business practices; or forced to cease doing business altogether or with the residents of one or more states or countries. Any change to PayPals business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the velocity of trade on eBay, in which case our business would suffer. 53 Table of Contents If PayPal were found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations governing banking, it could be subject to liability and forced to change its business practices. PayPal believes that the licensing or approval requirements of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board and other federal or state agencies that regulate banks, bank holding companies or other types of providers of electronic commerce services do not apply to PayPal, except for certain money transmitter licenses mentioned below. However, one or more states may conclude that, under its or their statutes, PayPal is engaged in an unauthorized banking business. PayPal received written communications from regulatory authorities in New York, most recently in February 2002, and Louisiana expressing the view that its service as it formerly operated constituted an unauthorized banking business, and from authorities in California and Idaho in 2001 that its service might constitute an unauthorized banking business. PayPal has taken steps to address these states concerns, and has received a conclusion from the New York Banking Department that its current business model does not constitute illegal banking. PayPal also has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter in California, Louisiana and Idaho. However, we cannot assure you that the steps PayPal has taken to address state regulatory concerns will be effective in all states. If PayPal is found to be engaged in an unauthorized banking business in one or more states, it might be subject to monetary penalties and adverse publicity and might be required to cease doing business with residents of those states. Even if the steps it has taken to resolve these states concerns are deemed sufficient by the state regulatory authorities, PayPal could be subject to fines and penalties for its prior activities. The need to comply with state laws prohibiting unauthorized banking activities could also limit PayPals ability to enhance its services in the future. Any change to PayPals business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the velocity of trade on eBay, in which case our business would suffer. If PayPal were found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations governing money transmitters, it could be subject to liability and forced to change its business practices. A number of states have enacted legislation regulating money transmitters and PayPal has applied for licenses under this legislation in 28 jurisdictions. To date, PayPal has obtained licenses in 20 states and the District of Columbia. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to bonding requirements, restrictions on its investment of customer funds, reporting requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies. If PayPals pending applications were denied, or if it were found to be subject to and in violation of any money services laws or regulations, PayPal also could be subject to liability or forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states or to change its business practices. Any change to PayPals business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the velocity of trade on eBay, in which case our business would suffer. Even if PayPal is not forced to change its business practices, it could be required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on PayPal. If PayPal were to be found subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations governing electronic fund transfers, it could be subject to liability and forced to change its business practices. Although there have been no definitive interpretations to date, PayPal has assumed that its service is subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E of the Federal Reserve Board. As a result, among other things, PayPal must provide advance disclosure of changes to its service, follow specified error resolution procedures and absorb losses from transactions not authorized by the consumer. In addition, PayPal is subject to the financial privacy provisions of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act and related regulations. As a result, some customer financial information that PayPal receives is subject to limitations on reuse and disclosure. Additionally, pending legislation at the state and federal levels may restrict further PayPals information gathering and disclosure practices. Existing and potential future privacy laws may limit PayPals ability to develop new products and services that make use of data gathered through its service. The provisions of these laws and related regulations are complicated, and PayPal does not have extensive experience in complying with these laws and related regulations. Even technical violations of 54 Table of Contents these laws can result in penalties of up to $1,000 assessed for each non compliant transaction. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, PayPal processed approximately 189,000 and 348,000 transactions per day, respectively, and any violations could expose PayPal to significant liability. PayPal is subject to laws and regulations on money laundering and reporting of suspicious activities that could have a material adverse impact on its business and could subject it to civil and criminal liability. PayPal is subject to money laundering laws and regulations that prohibit, among other things, its involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. These laws and regulations require PayPal to operate an anti money laundering program that contains at least the following elements: written policies and procedures (including those relating to customer identification), training for employees, designation of a compliance officer, and regular independent review of the program. PayPal has adopted a program to comply with these regulations, but any errors or failure to implement the program properly could lead to lawsuits, administrative action, fines and or prosecution by the government. PayPal is also subject to regulations that require it to report suspicious activities involving transactions of $2,000 or more and to obtain and keep more detailed records on the senders and recipients in certain transfers of $3,000 or more. The interpretation of suspicious activities in this context is uncertain. Future regulations under the USA PATRIOT Act may require PayPal to revise the procedures it takes to verify the identity of its customers and to monitor more closely international transactions. These regulations could impose significant costs on PayPal and make it more difficult for new customers to join its network. PayPal could be required to learn more about its customers before opening an account, to obtain additional verification of international customers and to monitor its customers activities more closely. These requirements could raise PayPals costs significantly and reduce the attractiveness of its product. Failure to comply with federal and state money laundering laws could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties and forfeiture of significant assets. PayPals status under banking or financial services laws or other laws in countries outside the U.S. is unclear. The cost of obtaining any required licenses or regulatory approvals in these countries could affect PayPals future profitability. PayPal currently offers its product to customers with credit cards in 37 countries outside the U.S. In 19 of these countries, customers can withdraw funds to local bank accounts. In these countries, it is not clear whether, in order to provide its product in compliance with local law, PayPal needs to be regulated as a bank or financial institution or otherwise. If PayPal were found to be subject to and in violation of any foreign laws or regulations, it could be subject to liability, forced to change its business practices or forced to suspend operations in one or more countries. Alternatively, PayPal could be required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on it and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of its product. Implementation of PayPals plans to enhance the attractiveness of its product for international customers, in particular its plans to offer customers the ability to transact business in major currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar, will increase the risks that it could be found to be in violation of laws or regulations in countries outside the U.S. In the fourth quarter of 2002, PayPal began offering customers the ability to send or receive payments in Pounds, Euros, Canadian Dollars or Yen, in addition to U.S. dollars. PayPals financial success will remain highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which its customers fund payments using credit cards rather than bank account transfers or existing PayPal account balances. PayPals profitability could be harmed if the rate at which customers fund using credit cards goes up. PayPal pays significant transaction fees when senders fund payment transactions using credit cards, nominal fees when customers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts and no fees when customers fund payment transactions from an existing PayPal account balance. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, senders funded 51.5% and 49.8%, respectively, of PayPals payment volume using credit cards. Senders may resist funding payments by electronic transfer from bank accounts because of the greater protection offered by credit cards, including 55 Table of Contents the ability to dispute and reverse merchant charges, because of frequent flier miles or other incentives offered by credit cards or because of generalized fears regarding privacy or loss of control in surrendering bank account information to a third party. Increases in credit card processing fees could increase PayPals costs, affect its profitability, or otherwise limit its operations. From time to time, Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover increase the interchange fees that they charge for each transaction using their cards. MasterCard is implementing an increase to its interchange fees effective April 2003. PayPals credit card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees on to PayPal. Any such increased fees could increase PayPals operating costs and reduce its profit margins. Furthermore, PayPals credit card processors require it to pledge cash as collateral with respect to PayPals acceptance of Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover and the amount of cash that PayPal is required to pledge could be increased at any time. PayPal has limited experience in managing and accounting accurately for large amounts of customer funds. PayPals failure to manage these funds properly would harm its business. PayPals ability to manage and account accurately for customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. PayPal has neither an established operating history nor proven management experience in maintaining, over a long term, these internal controls. As PayPals business continues to grow, it must strengthen its internal controls accordingly. PayPals success requires significant public confidence in its ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain necessary controls or to manage accurately customer funds could diminish customer use of PayPals product severely. Customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer service could affect use of our services adversely and, as a result, our business could suffer. Customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer service could diminish severely consumer confidence in and use of our services. Breaches of our customers privacy and our security measures could have the same effect. Measures we sometimes take to combat risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security can damage relations with our customers. These measures heighten the need for prompt and accurate customer service to resolve irregularities and disputes. PayPal has received negative media coverage, as well as public criticism regarding customer disputes. Effective customer service requires significant personnel expense, and this expense, if not managed properly, could impact our profitability significantly. Any inability by us to manage or train our customer service representatives properly could compromise our ability to handle customer complaints effectively. If we do not handle customer complaints effectively, our reputation may suffer and we may lose our customers confidence. Our failure to manage growth could harm us. We currently are experiencing a period of expansion in our headcount, facilities and infrastructure, and we anticipate that further expansion will be required to address potential growth in our customer base and number of listings as well as our expansion into new geographic areas, types of goods and alternative methods of sale. This expansion has placed, and we expect it will continue to place, a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. The areas that are put under strain by our growth include the following: The Websites. We must constantly add new hardware, update software and add new engineering personnel to accommodate the increased use of our and our subsidiaries websites and the new products and features we are regularly introducing. This upgrade process is expensive, and the increased complexity of our websites increases the cost of additional enhancements. If we are unable to increase the capacity of our systems at least as fast as the growth in demand for this capacity, our websites may become unstable and may cease to operate for periods of time. We are 56 Table of Contents in the midst of a significant multiyear project to enhance our current technical architecture. If this project is not successful, our business could be harmed. We have experienced periodic unscheduled downtime. Continued unscheduled downtime would harm our business and also could anger users of our websites and reduce future revenues. Customer Support. We are expanding our customer support operations to accommodate the increased number of users and transactions on our websites and the increased level of trust and safety activity we provide worldwide. If we are unable to provide these operations in a cost effective manner, users of our websites may have negative experiences, and current and future revenues could suffer, or our operating margins may decrease. Customer Accounts. Our revenues are dependent on prompt and accurate billing processes. If we are unable to grow our transaction processing abilities to accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed, our ability to collect revenue will be harmed. We must continue to hire, train and manage new employees at a rapid rate. If our new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to improve our transaction processing, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. This is a special challenge as we acquire new operations with different systems. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. We may be unable to hire, train, retain and manage required personnel or to identify and take advantage of existing and potential strategic relationships and market opportunities. The additional headcount and capital investments we are adding increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by offsetting expense reductions in the short term. Our business may be harmed by the listing or sale by our users of illegal items. The law relating to the liability of providers of online services for the activities of their users on their service is currently unsettled. We are aware that certain goods, such as firearms, other weapons, adult material, tobacco products, alcohol and other goods that may be subject to regulation by local, state or federal authorities, have been listed and traded on our service or paid for through PayPal. We may be unable to prevent the sale of unlawful goods, or the sale of goods in an unlawful manner, by users of our service (including PayPal users), and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through our service. We have been subject to several lawsuits based upon such allegations. In order to reduce our exposure to this liability, we have prohibited the listing of certain items and increased the number of personnel reviewing questionable items. In the future, we may implement other protective measures that could require us to spend substantial resources and or to reduce revenues by discontinuing certain service offerings. Any costs incurred as a result of liability or asserted liability relating to the sale of unlawful goods or the unlawful sale of goods, could harm our business. In addition, we have received significant and continuing media attention relating to the listing or sale of unlawful goods on our websites. This negative publicity could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand name. It also could make users reluctant to continue to use our services. We are subject to intellectual property and other litigation. On April 25, 2001, our European subsidiaries, eBay GmbH and eBay International AG, were sued by Montres Rolex S.A. and certain Rolex affiliates, or Rolex, in the regional court of Cologne, Germany. The suit subsequently was transferred to the regional court in Dusseldorf, Germany. Rolex alleged that our subsidiaries were infringing Rolexs trademarks as a result of users selling counterfeit Rolex watches through our German website. The suit also alleges unfair competition. Rolex sought an order forbidding the sale of Rolex watches on the website as well as damages. In December 2002, a trial was held in the matter and the court ruled in favor of eBay on all causes of action. Rolex has appealed the ruling, but the appeal has not yet been briefed or heard. 57 Table of Contents On September 26, 2001, a complaint was filed by MercExchange LLC against us, our Half.com subsidiary and ReturnBuy, Inc. in the Eastern District of Virginia (No. 2:01 CV 736) alleging infringement of three patents (relating to online auction technology, multiple database searching and electronic consignment systems) and seeking a permanent injunction and damages (including treble damages for willful infringement). We answered the complaint, denying the allegations. In April 2002, we filed four motions for summary judgment relating to the three patents in suit. The court denied three of those motions and deferred ruling on the fourth motion. A Markman hearing was held in July 2002 to define certain disputed terms in the patents, and in October 2002 the court issued its claim construction findings. In October 2002, the court gave us leave to amend our answer to include a claim that MercExchange committed fraud on the patent office during the prosecution of one of the patents. On the same date, the court granted in part our pending summary judgment motion, effectively invalidating the patent related to online auction technology and rendering it unenforceable. In November 2002, we filed two additional summary judgment motions regarding the patents. One motion was denied as moot; the other was denied because the court found there were triable issues of fact. In February 2003, we filed an additional summary judgment motion, which is still pending. Only two patents remain in the case at this time. Trial is scheduled for April 22, 2003. We believe we have meritorious defenses and will defend ourselves vigorously. However, even if successful, our defense against this action will be costly and could divert our managements time. If the plaintiff were to prevail on any of its claims, we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be enjoined from conducting a significant part of our U.S. business. Any such results could materially harm our business. We are unable to determine what potential losses we may incur if this lawsuit were to have an unfavorable outcome. On September 6, 2002, a complaint was filed by First USA Bank, N.A. against PayPal in the District of Delaware (No. 02 CV 1462) alleging infringement of two patents relating to assigning an alias to a credit card so as to eliminate the need for the physical presence of the card in a transaction and seeking a permanent injunction and damages. PayPal believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously. However, even if successful, our defense against this action will be costly and could divert managements time. If the plaintiff were to prevail on its claims, PayPal might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees or modify its business practices. Any such result could materially harm our business. We are unable to determine what potential losses we may incur if this suit were to have an unfavorable outcome. On August 16, 2002, Charles E. Hill & Associates, Inc., or Hill, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (No. 2:02 CV 186) alleging that we and 17 other companies, primarily large retailers, infringed three patents owned by Hill generally relating to electronic catalog systems and methods for transmitting and updating data at a remote computer. The suit seeks an injunction against continuing infringement, unspecified damages, including treble damages for willful infringement, and interest, costs, expenses and fees. In January 2003, the court granted the collective defendants motion to transfer the case from the court where it was filed in Marshall, Texas to the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. On February 20, 2002, PayPal was sued in California state court in a purported class action alleging that its restriction of customer accounts and failure to promptly unrestrict legitimate accounts violates state consumer protection law and is an unfair business practice and a breach of PayPals User Agreement. This action was refiled with a different named plaintiff on June 6, 2002, and a related action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on the same day. On March 12, 2002, PayPal was sued in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in a purported class action alleging that its restrictions of customer accounts and failure to promptly unrestrict legitimate accounts violates federal and state consumer protection and unfair business practice law. The court has denied PayPals motion to compel individual arbitration as required by the PayPal User Agreement and has invalidated that provision of the User Agreement. The two federal court actions have been consolidated into a single case. PayPal is defending itself vigorously, but if it is unable to prevail in these lawsuits, it 58 Table of Contents may have to change its anti fraud operations in a manner that will harm its business and pay substantial damages. Even if its defense is successful, the litigation could damage PayPals reputation, could require significant management time, will be costly and could require changes to its customer service and operations that could increase its costs and decrease the effectiveness of its anti fraud program. Three purported class action complaints were filed following announcement of the PayPal merger in July 2002 in the court of Chancery in the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County by alleged stockholders of PayPal. Two additional purported class action complaints were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, by alleged PayPal stockholders. These complaints name as defendants PayPal and each member of its board of directors as well as eBay. The complaints are purported class actions that allege, among other things, that eBay controlled PayPal prior to the execution of their merger agreement, the defendants breached fiduciary duties they assertedly owed to PayPals stockholders in connection with PayPal entering into the merger agreement and the exchange ratio in the merger was unfair and inadequate. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, an award of unspecified compensatory damages. We believe that each of the lawsuits is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. Other third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their past, current or future intellectual property rights. We have in the past been forced to litigate such claims. We may become more vulnerable to such claims as laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts and as we expand into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves is less favorable. We expect that we will increasingly be subject to copyright and trademark infringement claims as the geographical reach of our services expands. We also expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims as our services expand. In particular, we expect that patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our Payments business will continue to be made. We have been notified of several potential disputes and are subject to a suit by Tumbleweed Communications Corporation that is currently ongoing. These claims, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause service upgrade delays, require expensive changes in our methods of doing business or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, if available. As a result, these claims could harm our business. Our business may be harmed by the listing or sale by our users of pirated or counterfeit items. We have received in the past, and we anticipate we will receive in the future, communications alleging that certain items listed or sold through our service by our users infringe third party copyrights, trademarks and tradenames or other intellectual property rights. Although we have sought to work actively with the content community to eliminate infringing listings on our websites, some content owners have expressed the view that our efforts are insufficient. Content owners have been active in defending their rights against online companies, including eBay. Allegations of infringement of third party intellectual property rights have in the past and may in the future result in litigation against us. Such litigation is costly for us, could result in increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, could require us to change our business practices in expensive ways, or could otherwise harm our business. Litigation against other online companies could result in interpretations of the law that could also require us to change our business practices or otherwise increase our costs. Our business may be harmed by fraudulent activities on our websites. Our future success will depend largely upon sellers reliably delivering and accurately representing their listed goods and buyers paying the agreed purchase price. We have received in the past, and anticipate that we will receive in the future, communications from users who did not receive the purchase price or the goods that were to have been exchanged. In some cases individuals have been arrested and convicted for fraudulent activities using our websites. While we can suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their delivery obligations to other users, we do not have the ability to require users to make payments or deliver goods or otherwise make users whole other than through our limited buyer protection programs. 59 Table of Contents Other than through these programs, we do not compensate users who believe they have been defrauded by other users. We also periodically receive complaints from buyers as to the quality of the goods purchased. Negative publicity generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our service could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand name. We expect to continue to receive communications from users requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal action against us if no reimbursement is made. Our liability for these sort of claims is only beginning to be clarified and may be higher in some non U.S. jurisdictions than it is in the U.S. This sort of litigation could be costly for us, divert management attention, result in increased costs of doing business, lead to adverse judgments or could otherwise harm our business. In addition, affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies who could take action against us, including imposing fines or seeking injunctions. Government inquiries may lead to charges or penalties. On January 29, 1999, we received initial requests to produce certain records and information to the federal government relating to an investigation of possible illegal transactions in connection with our websites. We were informed that the inquiry includes an examination of our practices with respect to these transactions. We have continued to provide further information in connection with this ongoing inquiry. In order to protect the investigation, the court has ordered that no further public disclosures be made with respect to the matter. Should this or any other investigation lead to civil or criminal charges against us, we would likely be harmed by negative publicity, the cost of litigation, the diversion of management time and other negative effects, even if we ultimately prevail. Our business would suffer if we were not to prevail in any action like this. Even the process of providing records and information can be expensive, time consuming and result in the diversion of management attention. PayPal completed its exit from the business of processing payments for online gambling merchants in November 2002. Approximately 6% of PayPals revenues in 2002 were derived from this business. Beginning in July 2002, PayPal provided documents and information related to its services to online gambling merchants in response to a federal grand jury subpoena issued at the request of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. On March 28, 2003, PayPal received a letter from the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri indicating its contention that PayPals provision of services to online gambling merchants violated 18 U.S.C. 1960 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which prohibits the transmission of funds that are known to have been derived from a criminal offense or are intended to be used to promote or support unlawful activity, thereby subjecting PayPal to potential civil forfeiture of the amounts it received in connection with such activities as well as potential criminal liability. The letter offered a complete settlement of all possible claims and charges from the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri if PayPal paid the purported amount of its earnings derived from online gambling merchants during the nine month period from October 26, 2001 to July 31, 2002, plus interest. PayPal acted in the good faith belief that its conduct did not violate 18 U.S.C. 1960 and PayPal calculates that the amount of its earnings from online gaming activities was less than asserted in the letter. Should this investigation lead to a civil or criminal charge against PayPal, we would be harmed by negative publicity, the cost of litigation and the diversion of management time, even if PayPal ultimately prevails. Any finding of a civil or criminal violation by PayPal, or potentially any settlement, could also endanger PayPals ability to obtain, maintain or renew money transmitter licenses in jurisdictions where it requires such licenses to operate, which would materially harm our business. A large number of transactions occur on our websites. We believe that government regulators have received a substantial number of consumer complaints about both eBay and PayPal, which, while small as a percentage of our total transactions, are large in aggregate numbers. As a result, we have from time to time been contacted by various foreign, federal, state and local regulatory agencies and been told that they have questions with respect to the steps we take to protect our users from fraud and about our operations. We are likely to receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future, which may lead to action against us. We have responded to all inquiries from regulatory agencies by describing our current and planned antifraud efforts, customer support procedures and operating procedures. If one or more of 60 Table of Contents these agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future inquiries, the resultant investigations and potential fines or other penalties could harm our business. We are subject to laws relating to the use and transfer of personally identifiable information about our users and their transfers, especially outside of the U.S. Violation of these laws, which in many cases apply not only to third party transfers but also to transfers of information between ourselves and our subsidiaries, and between ourselves, our subsidiaries and our commercial partners could subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and could adversely affect us. Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences. We have acquired a number of businesses, including our acquisitions of Half.com, Internet Auction, iBazar, HomesDirect.com, NeoCom and PayPal. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets, including interests in our existing subsidiaries and joint ventures. At any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of such transactions. Any of such transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There is no assurance that any such discussions or negotiations will result in the consummation of any transaction. The process of integrating any acquisition, including the acquisition of PayPal, may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky. The areas where we may face difficulties include: diversion of management time at both companies during the period of negotiation through closing and further diversion of such time after closing, as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues of integration and future products; declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in compensation, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the business; the need to integrate each companys accounting, management information, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented; the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls, procedures and policies; and in some cases, the need to transition operations onto the existing eBay platform. Foreign acquisitions involve special risks, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures, languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions may not be realized. Future acquisitions or mergers could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our business. Future acquisitions or mergers may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Even if available, this financing may be dilutive. Problems with third parties who provide services to our users could harm us. A number of third parties provide services to our users that indirectly benefit us. Such services include seller tools that automate and manage listings, merchant tools that manage listings and interface with inventory management software, photo hosting, and other services. In many cases we have contractual agreements with these companies, which may give us a direct financial interest in their success, while in other cases we have none. In either circumstance, financial, regulatory or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to our users could reduce the number of listings on our websites or make completing transactions on our websites more difficult, and thereby harm our business. 61 Table of Contents In addition, although we generally have been able to renew or extend the terms of contractual arrangements with our third party service providers on acceptable terms, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future. Our contractual arrangement with our third party photo hosting service provider is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2003, subject to certain post termination obligations. If we are unable either to renegotiate the contract on terms acceptable to us, to build equivalent functionality ourselves or to find an alternative supplier, our business would be adversely affected. Third parties or governmental agencies may view our behavior as anti competitive. Third parties, including PayPal before its acquisition by us, have in the past and may in the future allege that actions taken by us violate the antitrust or competition laws of the U.S. or other countries, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. Such claims typically are very expensive to defend, involve negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and could result in significant judgments against us, all of which would adversely affect us. We have provided information to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice in connection with an inquiry into our conduct with respect to auction aggregators including our licensing program and a previously settled lawsuit against Bidders Edge. Although the Antitrust Division has closed this inquiry, if the Department of Justice or any other antitrust agency were to open other investigations of our activities, we would likely be harmed by negative publicity, the costs of the action, possible private antitrust lawsuits, the diversion of management time and effort and penalties we might suffer if we ultimately were not to prevail. Some of our businesses are subject to regulation and others may be in the future. As our activities and the types of goods listed on our site expand, state regulatory agencies may claim that we are subject to licensure in their jurisdiction, either with respect to our services in general, or in order to allow the sale of certain items (e.g., real estate, boats, automobiles). We are currently subject to potential regulation under the Office of Banks and Real Estate, or OBRE, in Illinois concerning the applicability of the Illinois Auction law to our services. In August 2002, Illinois amended the Illinois auction law to provide for a special regulatory regime for Internet auction listing services. We expect to register as an Internet auction listing service in Illinois following the adoption of regulations under the amended statute. Although we do not expect this registration to have a negative impact on our business, other regulatory and licensure claims could result in costly litigation or could require us to change our manner of doing business in ways that increase our costs or reduce our revenues or force us to prohibit listings of certain items for some locations. We could also be subject to fines or other penalties. Any of these outcomes could harm our business. As we have expanded internationally, we have become subject to additional regulations, including regulations on the transmission of personal information. These laws may require costly changes to our business practices. If we are found to have violated any of these laws, we could be subject to fines or penalties, and our business could be harmed. Our revenues from third party advertising and end to end services are subject to factors beyond our control and are expected to decrease. We recognize revenues from end to end service providers and direct advertising promotions. These revenues may be affected by the financial condition of the parties with whom we have these relationships and by the success of online promotions generally. Recently, the pricing of online advertisements has deteriorated. Our direct advertising revenues historically have been dependent in significant part on the performance of AOLs sales force. Our advertising sales relationship with AOL has not been extended or renewed and is scheduled to terminate on March 31, 2003, after which time we will be dependent on the efforts of our existing internal sales staff. Reduction in these revenues would adversely affect our results. 62 Table of Contents At this time, we expect third party advertising and end to end services revenues to decrease substantially on an absolute basis in 2003 relative to 2002. We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our service. The law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services is currently unsettled. Claims could be made against online services companies under both U.S. and foreign law for defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services. Several private lawsuits seeking to impose liability upon us under a number of these theories have been brought against us. In addition, federal, state and foreign legislation has been proposed that imposes liability for or prohibits the transmission over the Internet of certain types of information. Our service features a Feedback Forum, which includes information from users regarding other users. Although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us, claims of defamation or other injury have been made in the past and could be made in the future against us for content posted in the Feedback Forum. Claims like these are more likely and may have a higher probability of success in jurisdictions outside the U.S. If we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources and or to discontinue certain service offerings, which would negatively affect our financial results. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this liability or asserted liability could harm our business. The inability to expand our systems may limit our growth. We seek to generate a high volume of traffic and transactions on our services. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our websites, processing systems and network infrastructure are critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain large numbers of users. Our revenues depend primarily on the number of items listed by users, the volume of user transactions that are successfully completed, the final prices paid for the items listed and the volume of payment transactions by our payment customers. We need to expand and upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure both to meet increased traffic on our site and to implement new features and functions, including those required under our contracts with third parties. We may be unable to project accurately the rate or timing of increases, if any, in the use of our service or to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate any increases in a timely fashion. We use internally developed systems to operate our service for transaction processing, including billing and collections processing. We must continually improve these systems in order to accommodate the level of use of our websites. In addition, we may add new features and functionality to our services that would result in the need to develop or license additional technologies. We capitalize hardware and software costs associated with this development in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include such amounts in property and equipment. Our inability to add additional software and hardware or to upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems or network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic or transaction volume could have adverse consequences. These consequences include unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, degradation in levels of customer support, impaired quality of the users experiences of our service and delays in reporting accurate financial information. Our failure to provide new features or functionality also could result in these consequences. We may be unable to effectively upgrade and expand our systems in a timely manner or to integrate smoothly with our existing systems any newly developed or purchased technologies or businesses such as PayPal. These difficulties could harm or limit our ability to expand our business. 63 Table of Contents Unauthorized break ins or other assaults on our services could harm our business. Our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of data, public release of confidential data or the inability to complete customer transactions. In addition, unauthorized persons may improperly access our data. eBay has experienced an unauthorized break in by a hacker who has stated that he could, in the future, damage or change our system or take confidential information. We have also experienced denial of service type attacks on our system that have made all or portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time. These and other types of attacks could harm us. Actions of this sort may be very expensive to remedy and could damage our reputation and discourage new and existing users from using our services. System failures could harm our business. Our system has been designed around industry standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. Our services provide 24 hours a day, seven days a week availability, subject to a weekly scheduled two hour maintenance period. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks and similar events. They are also subject to break ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and to potential disruption if the operators of these facilities have financial difficulties. Only some of our systems are fully redundant and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial reasons or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. In addition, the failure by our hosting facilities to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service. Any damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service will reduce our revenues and profits, and our future revenues and profits will be harmed if our users believe that our system is unreliable. We have experienced system failures from time to time. eBays primary website has been interrupted for periods of up to 22 hours. In addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff, these outages create a flood of user questions and complaints that need to be addressed by our customer support personnel. Any unscheduled interruption in our services results in an immediate loss of revenues that can be substantial and may cause some users to switch to our competitors. If we experience frequent or persistent system failures on our websites, our reputation and brand could be permanently harmed. We have been taking steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems. These steps are expensive, reduce our margins and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime. Our infrastructure could prove unable to handle a larger volume of customer transactions. Any failure to accommodate transaction growth could impair customer satisfaction, lead to a loss of customers, impair our ability to add customers or increase its costs, all of which would harm our business. Because our customers may use our products for critical transactions, any errors, defects or other infrastructure problems could result in damage to our customers businesses. These customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses. Even if unsuccessful, this type of claim likely would be time consuming and costly for us to address. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Net revenues outside the United States accounted for approximately 15% of our net revenues in 2001 and 26% in 2002. Because a significant and growing portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in non U.S. currency exchange rates. The results of operations of our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. In connection with its multi currency service, PayPal fixes exchange rates twice per day, and 64 Table of Contents thus may face financial exposure if exchange rates move rapidly or if the rate is set incorrectly. As exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results, when translated, may differ materially from expectations. In particular, to the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Euro, our European revenues and profits will be reduced as the result of these translation adjustments. Our stock price has been and may continue to be extremely volatile. The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be extremely volatile. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following: actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results; unscheduled system downtime; additions or departures of key personnel; announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; conditions or trends in the Internet and online commerce industries; changes in the market valuations of other Internet companies; developments in regulation; events affecting PayPals business; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; unanticipated economic or political events; sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market; and other events or factors, including these described in this Risk Factors That May Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition section and others that may be beyond our control. In addition, the trading prices of Internet stocks in general, and ours in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent periods. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Notwithstanding a sharp decline in the prices of Internet stocks in general, the valuation of our stock remains extraordinarily high based on conventional valuation standards such as price to earnings and price to sales ratios. The trading price of our common stock has increased enormously from the initial public offering price. This trading price and valuation may not be sustained. Negative changes in the publics perception of the prospects of Internet or e commerce or technology companies have in the past and may in the future depress our stock price regardless of our results. Other broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions, such as recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations, also may decrease the market price of our common stock. In the past, following declines in the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation often has been instituted. Litigation of this type, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources. New and existing regulations could harm our business. We are subject to the same foreign, federal, state and local laws as other companies conducting business on and off the Internet. Today there are relatively few laws specifically directed towards online services. However, due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and online services, many laws relating to the Internet are being debated at the state and federal levels (both in the U.S. and abroad) and it is possible that laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the Internet or online services. These laws and regulations could cover issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, fraud, 65 Table of Contents content and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security. Applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property issues, taxation, libel, obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain. The vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Those laws that do reference the Internet, such as the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the European Unions (E.U.) Directive on Distance Selling and Electronic Commerce are only now beginning to be interpreted by the courts and implemented by the E.U. Member States, and so their applicability and scope remain somewhat uncertain. In addition, numerous states and foreign jurisdictions, including the State of California, where our headquarters is located, have regulations regarding how auctions may be conducted and the liability of auctioneers in conducting such auctions. No final legal determination has been made with respect to the applicability of the California regulations to our business to date and little precedent exists in this area. Several states and some foreign jurisdictions have attempted, and may attempt in the future, imposing such regulations upon us or our users, which could harm our business. In addition, as the nature of the products listed by our users changes, we may become subject to new regulatory restrictions, such as licensure as an auto dealer or real estate broker. Several domestic jurisdictions have proposed, and Minnesota has recently passed, legislation that would limit the uses of personal user information gathered online or offline. Many jurisdictions already have such laws and continuously consider strengthening them, especially against online services. eBay and PayPal in certain instances are subject to some of these current laws. PayPal may be subject to recently enacted legislation in several states and countries imposing greater restrictions on the ability of financial services companies to share user information with third parties without affirmative user consent. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also has settled several proceedings against companies regarding the manner in which personal information is collected from users and provided to third parties. Specific statutes intended to protect user privacy have been passed in many non U.S. jurisdictions, including virtually every non U.S. jurisdiction where we currently have a website. Compliance with these laws, given the tight integration of our systems across different countries and the need to move data to facilitate transactions amongst our users (e.g., to payment companies, shipping companies, etc.), is both necessary and difficult. Failure to comply could subject us to lawsuits, fines, criminal penalties, statutory damages, adverse publicity and other losses that could harm our business. Changes to existing laws or the passage of new laws intended to address these issues could directly affect the way we do business or could create uncertainty on the Internet. This could reduce demand for our services, increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service or delivery costs, or otherwise harm our business. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide, and we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide, foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws. For example, the Australian high court has ruled that a U.S. website in certain circumstances must comply with Australian laws regarding libel. As we have expanded our international activities, we have become obligated to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate. Laws regulating Internet companies outside of the U.S. may be less favorable than those in the U.S., giving greater rights to consumers, content owners and users. Compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings relative to those in the U.S. Our failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal fines to bans on our ability to offer our services. We are dependent on the continued growth of online commerce. The business of selling goods over the Internet, particularly through online trading, is new and dynamic. Our future net revenues and profits will be substantially dependent upon the widespread acceptance of the Internet and online services as a medium for commerce by consumers. Rapid growth in the use of and interest in the Internet and online services is a recent phenomenon. This acceptance and use may not continue. Even if the Internet is accepted, concerns about fraud, privacy and other problems may mean that a sufficiently broad base of consumers will not adopt the Internet as a medium of commerce. In particular, our websites require users to make publicly available personal information that some potential users may be unwilling to provide. These concerns may increase as additional publicity over 66 Table of Contents privacy issues on eBay or generally over the Internet increase. Market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over the Internet is highly uncertain, and there are few proven services and products. In order to expand our user base, we must appeal to and acquire consumers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods. If these consumers prove to be less active than our earlier users, and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our operating costs, including our cost of acquiring new customers, our business could be adversely impacted. We are dependent on key personnel. Our future performance will be substantially dependent on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel. Our future performance also will depend on our ability to retain and motivate our other officers and key personnel. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business. We do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel, we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies, and our Chief Executive Officer has fully vested the vast majority of her equity incentives. Our new businesses are all dependent on attracting and retaining key personnel. In addition, employee turnover and other labor problems frequently increase during the period following an acquisition as employees evaluate possible changes in compensation, culture, reporting relationships and the direction of the business. Such increased turnover could increase our costs and reduce our future revenues. Our future success also will depend on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and customer support personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. In making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment. Fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees whose stock option strike prices are substantially above current market prices. Our industry is intensely competitive. Depending on the category of product, we currently or potentially compete with a number of companies serving particular categories of goods as well as those serving broader ranges of goods. The Internet provides new, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of goods. We expect competition to intensify in the future as the barriers to entry into these channels are relatively low, as current offline and new competitors can easily launch online sites at a nominal cost using commercially available software or partnering with any one of a number of successful electronic commerce companies. Our broad based competitors include the vast majority of traditional department, warehouse, discount and general merchandise stores, emerging online retailers, online classified services, and other shopping channels such as offline and online home shopping networks. These include most prominently: Wal Mart, Kmart, Target, Sears, Macys, JC Penney, Costco, Office Depot, Staples, OfficeMax, Sams Club, Amazon.com, Buy.com, AOL.com, Yahoo! Shopping, MSN, QVC and Home Shopping Network/ HSN.com. We face competition from local, regional and national specialty retailers and exchanges in each of our categories of products.

Auctions and a large number of other regional and national companies engaged in consumer to consumer or business to consumer sales. Different aspects of our fixed priced business compete with the major Internet portals (AOL, MSN, Yahoo! and comparable companies outside the U.S.) as well as Amazon.com and others. Our international websites compete with similar online and offline channels in each of their vertical categories in most countries. In addition, they compete with general online e commerce sites, such as Quello and Otto in Germany, Yahoo Kimo in Taiwan, eSellpia in South Korea, El Corte Ingls in Spain, Kelkoo in Italy and Amazon in the U.K. and other countries. In some of these countries, there are online sites that have much larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we do, and in each of these 68 Table of Contents countries there are competitors that have a better understanding of local culture and commerce than we do. The principal competitive factors for eBay include the following: ability to attract buyers and sellers; volume of transactions and selection of goods; customer service; and brand recognition. With respect to our online competition, additional competitive factors include: community cohesion and interaction; system reliability; reliability of delivery and payment; website convenience and accessibility; level of service fees; and quality of search tools. Some current and potential competitors have longer company operating histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recognition in other business and Internet spaces than we do. Some of these competitors also have significantly greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources. Other online trading services may be acquired by, receive investments from, or enter into other commercial relationships with larger, well established and well financed companies. As a result, some of our competitors with other revenue sources may be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than we can. In addition, certain offline competitors may encourage manufacturers to limit or cease distribution of their products to dealers who sell through online channels such as eBay. The adoption by manufacturers of anti Internet policies could force eBay users to stop selling certain products on our site. Increased competition or anti Internet distribution policies may result in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and diminished value of our brand. Some of our competitors have offered services for free, and others may do this as well. We may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors. In order to respond to changes in the competitive environment, we may, from time to time, make pricing, service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could harm our business. For example, we have implemented a buyer protection program that generally insures items up to a value of $200, with a $25 deductible, for users with a non negative feedback rating at no cost to the user. In addition, certain competitors may offer or continue to offer free shipping or other transaction related services, which could be impractical or inefficient for eBay users to match. New technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling our competitors to offer a lower cost service. Although we have established Internet traffic arrangements with several large online services and search engine companies, these arrangements may not be renewed on commercially reasonable terms. Even if these arrangements are renewed, they may not result in increased usage of our service. In addition, companies that control access to transactions through network access, Internet browsers, or search engines, or Internet based applications could promote our competitors, channel users to electronic commerce sites that compete with us, or charge us substantial fees for inclusion. 69 Table of Contents The market for PayPals product is emerging, intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. PayPal competes with existing on line and off line payment methods, including, among others: Credit card merchant processors that offer their services to online merchants, including First Data, Concord EFS, Paymentech, and Wells Fargo; and payment gateways, including VeriSign and Authorize.net; MoneyZap and BidPay offered by Western Union, a subsidiary of First Data; Yahoo! PayDirect offered by Yahoo! and HSBC; c2it offered by Citigroup; WebPay and Valid offered by CheckFree; and U.S.P.S. SendMoney offered by the U.S. Postal Service. Some of these competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, customer service and other resources, greater name recognition or a larger base of customers in affiliated businesses than PayPal. For example, Citigroups c2it has existing arrangements with AOL Time Warner and Microsoft. PayPals competitors may respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements faster and more effectively than PayPal. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products and services than PayPal, and they may offer lower prices. Some of these competitors have offered, and may continue to offer, their services for free in order to gain market share, and PayPal may be forced to lower its prices in response. Competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may offer greater liquidity and engender greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services than PayPal. If these competitors acquired significant market share, this could result in PayPal losing market share. PayPal also competes with providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit cards, checks, money orders and ACH transactions. Associations of traditional financial institutions such as Visa, MasterCard and NACHA generally set the features of these payment methods. The associations have initiated programs to enhance the usability of these payment methods for online transactions and could lower fees charged to online merchants. Either of these changes could make it more difficult for PayPal to retain and attract customers. Overseas, PayPal faces competition from similar channels and payment methods in most countries and from regional and national online and offline competitors in each country including First Gate and World Pay in the European Community, No Chex in the U.K., CertaPay and HyperWallet in Canada, and Paymate in Australia. In addition, in certain countries, such as Germany, electronic funds transfer (EFT) is a leading method of payment for both online and offline transactions. As in the U.S., established banks and other financial institutions that do not currently offer online payments could quickly and easily develop such a service. Half.com competes directly with online and offline retailers in its product categories such as Amazon.com, as well as with traditional offline and online sellers of new and used books, videos and CDs, consumer electronics and other products. Our business is dependent on the development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure. The success of our service will depend largely on the development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity and security, as well as timely development of complementary products, for providing reliable Internet access and services. The Internet has experienced, and is likely to continue to experience, significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic. If the Internet continues to experience increased numbers of users, increased frequency of use or increased bandwidth requirements, the Internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it. In addition, the performance of the 70 Table of Contents Internet may be harmed by increased number of users or bandwidth requirements or by viruses, worms and similar programs. The backbone computers of the Internet have been the targets of such programs. The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage as well as the level of traffic and the processing transactions on our service. Our business is subject to online commerce security risks. To succeed, online commerce and communications must provide a secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Our security measures may not prevent security breaches. Our failure to prevent security breaches could harm our business. Currently, a significant number of our users authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us. PayPals and Billpoints users routinely provide credit card and other financial information. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information, including customer credit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect customer transaction data. A number of websites have reported breaches of their security. Any compromise of our security could harm our reputation and, therefore, our business. In addition, a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. These issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we operate. Our users may also be targeted by parties attempting to misappropriate passwords, credit card numbers or other personal information by using fraudulent emails and websites appearing to be sent or operated by us. We actively pursue the parties responsible for these attempts at misappropriation and encourage our users to divulge sensitive information only after they have verified that they are on our legitimate websites, but we cannot entirely eliminate these types of activities. Security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our insurance policies carry low coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. We must keep pace with rapid technological change to remain competitive. Our competitive space is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new service and product introductions and enhancements and changing customer demands. These characteristics are caused in part by the emerging and changing nature of the Internet. Our future success therefore will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt our services to evolving industry standards and to improve the performance, features and reliability of our service. Our failure to adapt to such changes would harm our business. New technologies, such as the development of a peer to peer personal trading technology, could adversely affect us. In addition, the widespread adoption of new Internet, networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure. We need to develop new services, features and functions in order to expand. We plan to expand our operations by developing new or complementary services, products or transaction formats or expanding the breadth and depth of services. We may be unable to expand our operations in a cost effective or timely manner. Even if we do expand, we may not maintain or increase our overall acceptance. If we launch a new business or service that is not favorably received by consumers, it could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand. We anticipate that future services will include pre trade and post trade services. 71 Table of Contents We are pursuing strategic relationships with third parties to provide many of these services. Because we use third parties to deliver these services, we may be unable to control the quality of these services, and our ability to address problems if any of these third parties fails to perform adequately will be reduced. Expanding our operations in this manner also will require significant additional expenses and development, operations and other resources and will strain our management, financial and operational resources. The lack of acceptance of any new services could harm our business. Our growth will depend on our ability to develop our brand. We believe that eBays historical growth has been largely attributable to word of mouth. Both eBay and PayPal have benefited from frequent and high visibility media exposure both nationally and locally. We believe that continuing to strengthen our brand will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services. Promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide high quality services. In order to promote our brand, we will need to increase our marketing budget and otherwise increase our financial commitment to creating and maintaining brand loyalty among users. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues, and even if they do, any increased revenues may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. If we do attract new users to our services, they may not conduct transactions over our services on a regular basis. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, our business would be harmed. We may be unable to protect or enforce our own intellectual property rights adequately. We regard the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress and trade secret laws and through the domain name dispute resolution system. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services. We have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. These contractual arrangements and the other steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter independent third party development of similar technologies. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. Effective trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress, trade secret and domain name protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation. Protection may not be available in every country in which our services are made available online. Furthermore, we must also protect our trademarks, patents and domain names in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful in every location. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. These licensees may take actions that might diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. We are subject to the risks of owning real property. We own real property including land, buildings and interests in a partnership holding land and buildings, primarily related to our operations. We have little experience in managing real property. Ownership of this property subjects us to risks, including: the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems; adverse changes in the value of these properties, due to interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhoods in which the properties are located, or other factors; the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning, seismic, disability act or other requirements; and 72 Table of Contents possible disputes with tenants, partners or others. Some anti takeover provisions may affect the price of our common stock. The Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences, rights and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock may be harmed by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. Some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These include provisions that provide for a classified board of directors, prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings. We are also subject to provisions of Delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are met. This restriction could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control. Principal Accountant Fees and Services During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, fees for services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or PwC, were as follows (rounded to the nearest $1,000): Year Ended December 31, 2001 2002 Audit Fees $ 670,000 $ 1,195,000 Audit Related Fees 969,000 747,000 Tax Fees 15,000 19,000 All Other Fees 31,000 91,000 Total $ 1,685,000 $ 2,052,000 Audit fees consisted of fees billed for services rendered for the audit of eBays annual financial statements, review of financial statements included in eBays quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, and other services normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings. Audit related fees consisted primarily of fees billed for due diligence review in connection with acquisitions and divestitures and consultation regarding financial accounting and reporting matters. Tax fees consisted of fees billed for consulting regarding tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. All other fees consisted of fees billed for services in connection with legal matters and technical accounting research. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has determined that the rendering of non audit services by PwC was compatible with maintaining their independence. Audit Committee Pre Approval Policy Our Audit Committee has adopted a policy requiring the pre approval of any non audit engagement of PwC. In the event that we wish to engage PwC to perform accounting, technical, diligence or other permitted services not related to the services performed by PwC as our independent auditor, our internal finance personnel will prepare a summary of the proposed engagement, detailing the nature of the engagement, the reasons why PwC is the preferred provider of such services and the estimated duration and cost of the engagement. The report will be provided to our Audit Committee or a designated committee member, who will evaluate whether the proposed engagement will interfere with the independence of PwC in the performance of its auditing services. In the future, we intend to disclose all approved non audit engagements in the appropriate quarterly report on Form 10 Q or annual report on Form 10 K. 73 Table of Contents Our Audit Committee adopted the policy on pre approval of non audit engagements in October 2002 and approved the following non audit engagements through December 31, 2002: the prior engagement by PayPal of PwC to perform an analysis under Statement on Accounting Standards (SAS) No. 70 (Service Organizations) of PayPals information technology processes and controls; the possible engagement of PwC to provide general financial advisory services to us in connection with our possible involvement in an arbitration proceeding related to the interpretation of a contractual provision; the engagement by PayPal of PwC to review PayPals internal compliance audit under the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act; the engagement by PayPal Asset Management, Inc. of PwC to audit the financial statements and prepare the federal tax return of PayPal Money Market Reserve Fund; and the engagement by PayPal of PwC to prepare the personal income tax return of an expatriate employee of PayPal working in the United Kingdom. 74 Table of Contents ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents, short term and long term investments in a variety of securities, including government and corporate obligations and money market funds. These securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of estimated tax. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. In general, securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed rate securities, floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease. Due in part to these factors, our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2002, our fixed income investments had an unrealized gain of $3.6 million with a pretax yield of approximately 2.2% and a weighted average maturity of 2 months. If interest rates were to instantaneously increase (decrease) by 100 basis points, the fair market value of the total investment portfolio could decrease (increase) by approximately $3.3 million. Assuming an average investment balance of $1.8 billion, if rates were to increase (decrease) by 100 basis points, this would translate to an increase (decrease) in interest income of approximately $18 million annually. We entered into two interest rate swaps on June 19 and July 20, 2000, totaling $95 million to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on a portion of the floating rate operating lease for our primary office facilities. The interest rate swaps allow us to receive floating rate receipts based on LIBOR in exchange for making fixed rate payments which effectively changes our interest rate exposure on our operating lease from a floating rate to a fixed rate on $95 million of the total $126.4 million notional amount of our operating lease commitment. Of the $126.4 million operating lease commitment for our San Jose facility, the interest rate is fixed on $95 million with the balance of $31.4 million remaining at a floating rate of interest based on the spread over 3 month LIBOR. See Item 2: Properties and Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. If the 3 month LIBOR rates were to increase (decrease) by 100 basis points, then our lease payments would increase (decrease) by approximately $78,000 per quarter. Equity Price Risk We are exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of equity investments we hold, typically as the result of strategic investments in third parties that are subject to considerable market risk due to their volatility. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure in these equity investments. As of December 31, 2002, we did not have any unrealized gains or losses associated with our equity investments. In accordance with our policy to assess whether an impairment loss on our investments has occurred due to declines in fair value and other market conditions, we determined that declines in fair value of certain of our marketable and non marketable equity investments were other than temporary. Accordingly, we recorded impairment charges totaling $3.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2002, relating to the other than temporary impairment in the fair value of certain equity investments. At December 31, 2002, the total value of our equity investments was $44.2 million, including $3.4 million in marketable investments. Foreign Currency Risk International net revenues result from transactions by our foreign operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country. These operations also incur most of their expenses in 75 Table of Contents the local currency. Accordingly, our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as well as our results of operations. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet. The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on eBays financial position for the year ended December 31, 2002, was a translation loss of approximately $48.0 million. This loss is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through other comprehensive income. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other our functional currency create gains and losses which are reflected in our consolidated statement of income. The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on eBays results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002, was a transaction loss of approximately $1.1 million. As of December 31, 2002, we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with notional values equivalent to approximately $69 million with maturity dates within 92 days. The forward contracts are used to offset changes in the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as a result of currency fluctuations. Transaction gains and losses on the contracts and the assets and liabilities are recognized each period in our statement of income and generally are offsetting. As we purchased the forward contracts on December 31, 2002, the fair values of the forward contracts were immaterial as of this date.
