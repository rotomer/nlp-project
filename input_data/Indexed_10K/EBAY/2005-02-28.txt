Overview About eBay We pioneered online trading by developing an Internet based marketplace in which a community of buyers and sellers are brought together in an entertaining, intuitive, easy to use environment to browse, buy and sell an enormous variety of items. Through our PayPal service, we enable any business or consumer with email to send and receive electronic payments securely, conveniently and cost effectively. Executive Operating and Financial Summary Our focus is on understanding our key operating and financial metrics Members of our senior management team regularly review key operating metrics such as new users, active users, listings and gross merchandise volume as well as new user accounts and total payment volume processed by our wholly owned PayPal subsidiary. Members of our senior management also regularly review key financial information including net revenues, operating income margins, earnings per share, cash flows from operations and free cash flows, which we define as operating cash flows less purchases of property and equipment, net. These operating and financial measures allow us to monitor the health and vibrancy of our 19 Table of Contents marketplace and our global payments platform, and the profitability of our business and to evaluate the effectiveness of investments that we have made and continue to make in the areas of international expansion, customer support, product development, marketing and site operations. We believe that an understanding of these key operating and financial measures and how they change over time is important to investors, analysts and other parties analyzing our business results and future market opportunities. Our expectations for growth We expect that our growth in net revenues during 2005 will result primarily from increased net transaction revenues across our U.S. Marketplace, International Marketplace and Payments segments. We continue to make investments in our business and infrastructure to help us achieve our long term growth objectives. We expect to continue our investments in the areas of international expansion for both our eBay Marketplace and our PayPal businesses, customer support, site operations, marketing and various corporate infrastructure areas. We believe these investments are necessary to support the long term demands of our growing business as well as to build the infrastructure necessary to support long term growth. In addition, to the extent that the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, and, in particular, the Euro and the British pound, the remeasurement of these foreign currency denominated transactions into U.S. dollars will negatively impact our consolidated net revenues and, to the extent that they are not hedged, our net income. The detailed discussion of our consolidated financial results contained herein is intended to provide information to assist investors, analysts and other parties reading this report in understanding the key operating and financial measures summarized above as well as the changes in our consolidated results of operations from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. Seasonality The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, our total net revenues and the sequential quarterly growth of these net revenues. March 31 June 30 September 30 December 31 (In thousands, except percentages) 2002 Net revenues $ 245,106 $ 266,287 $ 288,779 $ 413,928 * Current quarter vs prior quarter 12 % 9 % 8 % 43 % 2003 Net revenues $ 476,492 $ 509,269 $ 530,942 $ 648,393 Current quarter vs prior quarter 15 % 7 % 4 % 22 % 2004 Net revenues $ 756,239 $ 773,412 $ 805,876 $ 935,782 Current quarter vs prior quarter 17 % 2 % 4 % 16 % * Includes net revenues from PayPal subsequent to our acquisition on October 3, 2002. As our business matures, transaction activity patterns on our websites increasingly mirror general consumer buying patterns, both online and offline. We have historically experienced our strongest quarters of sequential growth in the first and fourth fiscal quarters. We expect this pattern of seasonality to continue. Business Combinations Through both domestic and international acquisitions, we have continued to expand eBays global online marketplace. The financial results of entities acquired in purchase transactions are reflected in our consolidated results from the effective dates of each acquisition. The aggregate purchase price for completed acquisitions totaled $1.0 billion in 2004, $246 million in 2003, and $1.6 billion in 2002. We accounted for each acquisition as a purchase transaction and, accordingly, each purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their respective estimated fair values on 20 Table of Contents the acquisition date. Acquired intangible assets related to these purchases totaled $131 million in 2004, $29 million in 2003, and $286 million in 2002. See Note 1 The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, certain data from our consolidated statement of income as a percentage of net revenues. This information should be read in conjunction with Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates as well as our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2003 2004 Net revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of net revenues 17.6 19.2 18.8 Gross profit 82.4 80.8 81.2 Operating expenses: Sales and marketing 28.8 26.2 26.2 Product development 8.6 7.4 7.4 General and administrative 14.1 14.0 12.7 Patent litigation expense 1.4 Payroll tax on employee stock options 0.3 0.4 0.5 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 1.3 2.3 2.0 Total operating expenses 53.1 51.7 48.8 Income from operations 29.3 29.1 32.4 Interest and other income, net 4.1 1.7 2.4 Interest expense (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.3 ) Impairment of certain equity investments (0.3 ) (0.1 ) Income before cumulative effect of accounting change, income taxes and minority interests 32.8 30.6 34.5 Provision for income taxes (12.0 ) (9.5 ) (10.5 ) Minority interests (0.2 ) (0.4 ) (0.2 ) Income before cumulative effect of accounting change 20.6 20.7 23.8 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax (0.3 ) Net income 20.6 % 20.4 % 23.8 % Our net revenues are derived primarily from listing, feature and final value fees paid by sellers on our eBay Marketplace and fees from payment processing services on our PayPal platform. Our net revenues have continued to grow each year, primarily as a result of increased auction and fixed price transaction activity, reflected in the growth in the number of our confirmed registered users, user activity, listings, user gross merchandise volume on our eBay Marketplace platforms and payment transactions processed by PayPal. We believe these increases are largely the result of our promotional efforts and our emphasis on enhancing the online trading experience of our user community, both domestically and internationally, through the introduction of new site features and functionality and expanded trust and safety programs. 21 Table of Contents Net Revenues Summary Year Ended Year Ended Year Ended December 31, Percent December 31, Percent December 31, 2002 Change 2003 Change 2004 (In thousands, except percent changes) Net Revenues by Type: Net transaction revenues U.S. Marketplace $ 718,239 43 % $ 1,024,915 31 % $ 1,338,715 International Marketplace 297,485 121 % 657,874 76 % 1,157,472 Payments 93,303 360 % 429,453 59 % 680,813 Total net transaction revenues 1,109,027 90 % 2,112,242 50 % 3,177,000 Advertising and other non transaction net revenues 105,073 (50 )% 52,854 78 % 94,309 Total net revenues $ 1,214,100 78 % $ 2,165,096 51 % $ 3,271,309 Net Revenues by Segment: U.S. Marketplace $ 816,596 30 % $ 1,062,834 32 % $ 1,399,848 International Marketplace 302,136 120 % 664,640 77 % 1,173,759 Payments 95,368 359 % 437,622 59 % 697,702 Total net revenues $ 1,214,100 78 % $ 2,165,096 51 % $ 3,271,309 Net Revenues by Geography: U.S. $ 897,701 57 % $ 1,406,512 34 % $ 1,889,936 International 316,399 140 % 758,584 82 % 1,381,373 Total net revenues $ 1,214,100 78 % $ 2,165,096 51 % $ 3,271,309 Net revenues are attributed to U.S. and International geographies based upon the country in which the seller, payment recipient, advertiser or service provider is located.

(9) Total dollar volume of payments initiated through the PayPal system during the year, regardless of whether the payment was actually sent successfully, or was reversed, rejected, or was pending at the end of the year. The U.S. Marketplace segment includes our U.S. marketplace trading platforms, other than our PayPal subsidiary. The International Marketplace segment includes our international marketplace trading platforms excluding our PayPal subsidiary. The Payments segment includes our global payments platform consisting of our PayPal subsidiary. The Payments segment reflects the historical operations of our former Billpoint subsidiary and of PayPals operations for the periods subsequent to our acquisition of PayPal on October 3, 2002. We completed our planned wind down of Billpoint in the first half of 2003. Our net revenues result from fees associated with our transaction, advertising and other services in our U.S. Marketplace, International Marketplace and Payments segments. Net transaction revenues are derived primarily from listing, feature and final value fees paid by sellers and fees from payment processing services. Net revenues from advertising are derived principally from the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements for cash and through barter arrangements. Other non transaction net revenues are derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide transaction services to eBay and PayPal users and also from offline services provided by our former Butterfields and Kruse subsidiaries, which were divested in the second half of 2002. The successive year over year growth in net revenues from 2002 through 2004 was primarily the result of increased auction and fixed price transaction activity, reflected in the growth in the number of our confirmed registered users, user activity, listings, gross merchandise volume and payment transactions processed by PayPal. Our net revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2003 also reflects a full year of payment transactions processed by PayPal, which we acquired in October 2002. eBay Marketplace Net Transaction Revenues Total net transaction revenues from the U.S. and International Marketplace segments in aggregate increased 48% in 2004, 66% in 2003, and 73% in 2002, compared to the respective prior year. The growth in both U.S. Marketplace and International Marketplace segment net transaction revenues was primarily the result of increased auction transaction activity, reflected in the growth of the number of registered users, active users, listings and gross merchandise volume. Gross merchandise volume from the U.S. and International Marketplace segments together increased 44% in 2004 and 60% in both 2003 and 2002, compared to the respective prior year. U.S. and International Marketplace segment net transaction revenues as a percentage of user gross merchandise volume was 7.3% for 2004, 7.1% for 2003, and 6.8% for 2002. The increases in 2004 and 2003 reflected increased feature adoption and the impact of our fee increases implemented in those years. In addition, there was gross merchandise volume growth across all major categories, with the motors, clothing & accessories, consumer electronics, home & garden, books/movies/music, sports, and computer categories having the most significant dollar impact. The number of active users on the eBay platform increased 36% during 2004 to 56.1 million at December 31, 2004. Active users increased 49% during 2003 to 41.2 million at December 31, 2003, from 27.7 million at December 31, 2002. We believe that increases in user activity are largely the result of our promotional efforts and our emphasis on helping our user community be successful through the introduction of new site features and functionality and expanded trust and safety programs, in addition to our international expansion. 23 Table of Contents The number of items listed on eBays trading platforms increased 45% to 1.4 billion in 2004, from 971.0 million in 2003, and increased 52% in 2003 from 638.3 million in 2002. This percentage growth in listings was experienced across our U.S. and, more significantly, our international platforms. U.S. Marketplace Segment U.S. Marketplace segment net transaction revenues increased 31% in 2004, 43% in 2003, and 51% in 2002, compared to the respective prior year. Gross merchandise volume from the U.S. Marketplace segment increased 27% in 2004, and 41% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The U.S. Marketplace is our largest and most developed business. Net transaction revenues derived from the U.S. Marketplace segment represented 42% of the total net transaction revenues in 2004. We expect net transaction revenues from our U.S. Marketplace segment to increase in 2005, but to decrease as a percentage of total eBay Marketplace net transaction revenues as the International Marketplace segment grows in significance. In addition, even as the U.S. Marketplace segment continues to grow in absolute terms, we expect its growth rate in 2005 to be lower than that of 2004. International Marketplace Segment International Marketplace segment net transaction revenues increased 76% in 2004, 121% in 2003, and 168% in 2002, compared to the respective prior year. International Marketplace segment net transaction revenues as a percentage of total net transaction revenues was 36% in 2004, 31% in 2003 and 27% in 2002. Gross merchandise volume from the International Marketplace segment increased 70% in 2004, 102% in 2003, and 126% in 2002, compared to the respective prior year. For 2004, the growth in our International Marketplace segment net transaction revenues, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net transaction revenues, was primarily the result of strong performances in the United Kingdom and South Korea and a solid performance in Germany. The relative strength of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar resulted in increased net revenues of approximately $117.0 million during 2004, when compared to the results if the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates used in the preparation of our 2003 consolidated financial statements were used. Changes in foreign currency rates will impact our operating results and, to the extent that the U.S. dollar strengthens, our foreign currency denominated net revenues will be negatively impacted. We expect that the growth rates of our International Marketplace segment transaction net revenues will continue to decline in 2005, although we expect such revenues to grow in significance relative to our total eBay Marketplace as we continue to develop and deploy our global online trading platform during 2005. Payments Segment Net Transaction Revenues Payments segment net transaction revenues increased 59% in 2004, 360% in 2003 and 452% in 2002, compared to the respective prior year. Payments segment net transaction revenues as a percentage of total net transaction revenues was 21% in 2004, 20% in 2003, and 8% in 2002. The growth in our Payments segment net transaction revenues, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net transaction revenues is primarily the result of increases in PayPal transaction volume driven primarily by the growth in the eBay Marketplace and, for 2003 and 2002, our acquisition of PayPal in October 2002. During 2004, over $18.9 billion in total payment volume was transacted on the PayPal platform as compared to $12.2 billion during 2003. As of December 31, 2004, PayPal had 63.8 million accounts, compared to 40.3 million accounts at December 31, 2003. Our Payments segment net transaction revenues as a percentage of total payment volume was 3.6% in 2004 and 3.5% in 2003. The growth in Payments net transaction revenues was positively affected by PayPals continued penetration of eBay Marketplace transactions in all countries, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. Further, Payments net transaction revenues have grown in connection with the increase in our eBay Marketplace gross merchandise volume during 2003 and 2004. The relative strength of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, against the U.S. dollar and the British pound, resulted in increased net revenues of approximately $12.9 million during 2004 when compared to the results if the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates used in the preparation of our 2003 consolidated financial statements were used. 24 Table of Contents Net transaction revenues from the Payments segment earned internationally totaled $207.6 million in 2004 and $93.9 million in 2003, representing 30.5% and 21.9% of total Payments segment net transaction revenue, respectively. Changes in foreign currency rates will impact our operating results and, to the extent that the U.S. dollar strengthens, our foreign currency denominated net revenues will be negatively impacted. We expect the Payments segment net transaction revenues to increase in total during 2005 and for net transaction revenues earned internationally to increase in total and as a percentage of Payments net transaction revenues. We also expect that the Payments segment net transaction revenues will increase as a percentage of total net transaction revenues in 2005. Advertising and Other Non Transaction Net Revenues Advertising and other non transaction net revenues increased in total and as a percentage of total net revenues in 2004 as compared to 2003. Advertising and other net revenues totaled $94.3 million in 2004, $52.9 million in 2003 and $105.1 million in 2002. These amounts as a percentage of total net revenues represented 3% in 2004, 2% in 2003 and 9% in 2002. We continue to view our business as primarily transaction driven and we expect advertising and other net revenues to continue to represent a relatively small proportion of total net revenues during 2005. Cost of Net Revenues Percent Percent 2002 Change 2003 Change 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Cost of net revenues $ 213,876 95 % $ 416,058 48 % $ 614,415 As a percentage of net revenues 17.6 % 19.2 % 18.8 % Cost of net revenues consists primarily of costs associated with payment processing, site operations, and certain types of customer support. Significant cost components include bank charges, credit card interchange, other payment processing costs, employee compensation and facilities costs for our customer support and site operations, depreciation of equipment and amortization of required capitalization of major site and product development costs. The increase in cost of net revenues during 2004 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions on the PayPal and eBay websites and continued development and expansion of our customer support and site operations infrastructure. The decrease in cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to eBays Marketplaces site operations costs growing at a slower rate than net revenues. Payment processing costs increased to $305.1 million in 2004 from $215.7 million in 2003, due to the increase in PayPals total payment volume and increased payment processing costs related to the growth of our eBay Marketplace activity. Aggregate customer support and site operations costs increased $105.3 million during 2004, compared to the prior year, and resulted primarily from an increase in headcount and related employee costs and consultant costs of approximately $37.1 million and increased facilities costs of approximately $16.2 million. In addition, aggregate depreciation of site equipment and amortization of capitalized software development costs increased $36.0 million as compared to 2003. Costs of net revenues are expected to increase in total and to decrease slightly as a percentage of net revenues during 2005. Cost of net revenues increased in total and slightly as a percentage of net revenues in 2003 as compared to 2002. The increase in absolute dollars was due to a full year of payment processing costs resulting from our acquisition of PayPal in October 2002, an increase in the volume of transactions on the eBay websites, and continued development and expansion of our customer support and site operations infrastructure. The increase in cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the impact of PayPals higher structural costs relating to payment processing offset, in part, by eBays site operations costs growing at a slower rate than net revenues. Payment processing costs, which consist of credit card interchange fees, bank charges and other processing charges increased by approximately $94.9 million in 2003, reflecting the full year of PayPal activity in 2003, the substantial increase in PayPals total payment volume and increased payment processing costs related to our eBay fees. Aggregate customer support and site operations costs increased 25 Table of Contents $80.0 million during 2003, compared to the prior year, and resulted primarily from an increase in headcount and related employee costs of approximately $26.5 million. In addition, aggregate depreciation of site equipment and amortization of capitalized software development costs increased $21.5 million as compared to 2002. Operating Expenses Sales and Marketing Percent Percent 2002 Change 2003 Change 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Sales and marketing $ 349,650 62 % $ 567,565 51 % $ 857,874 As a percentage of net revenues 28.8 % 26.2 % 26.2 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising, tradeshow and other promotional costs, employee compensation for our category development and marketing staff and certain trust and safety programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased in 2004, but remained consistent as a percentage of total net revenues due to our continued investment in growing our user base and our development of new media campaigns. Growth in advertising and marketing costs as well as employee related costs comprised the majority of the increases. Combined advertising and marketing costs increased $169.8 million in 2004, compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of our internet marketing and domestic and international television and radio advertising campaigns as well as several category focused print campaigns. Employee related costs increased by $68.4 million in 2004 as we continued to expand our domestic and international operations. Sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in total and as a percentage of net revenues during 2005. In addition, our 2005 online marketing expenses will likely increase both in total and slightly as a percentage of revenues because of increases in the volume of online advertising that we expect to purchase in order to attract new customers and increase the activity on our websites including growth initiatives in sales and marketing activities in our U.S. and International Marketplaces, including China. Sales and marketing expenses increased in 2003, but decreased as a percentage of total net revenues due to cost efficiencies in our business and the acquisition of PayPal, which has a significantly lower sales and marketing requirement as PayPal benefits from eBay customer acquisitions. Growth in advertising and marketing costs as well as employee related costs comprised the majority of the dollar increases. Combined advertising and marketing costs increased $155.2 million in 2003, as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of our marketing programs directed towards our internet marketing and national television advertising campaigns as well as several category focused print campaigns. Employee related costs increased by $34.0 million in 2003 as we continued to expand our international operations. Product Development Percent Percent 2002 Change 2003 Change 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Product development $ 104,636 52 % $ 159,315 51 % $ 240,647 As a percentage of net revenues 8.6 % 7.4 % 7.4 % Product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, consultant costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment used for development. Product development expenses are net of required capitalization of major site and other product development efforts, including the development of our V3 platform architecture, migration of certain platforms, global billing, seller tools and payment gateway projects. These capitalized costs totaled $41.3 million in 2004, $38.5 million in 2003 and $15.5 million in 2002, and are reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods. We anticipate that we will continue to devote significant resources to product development in the future as we add new features and functionality to the eBay and PayPal platforms. 26 Table of Contents The increase in product development expenses in 2004, as compared to the prior year, was primarily the result of increased headcount and consultant costs. The headcount growth was focused on hiring new employees for various platform development initiatives at eBay and PayPal in addition to our international expansion of both platforms. Our development staff increased approximately 48% from approximately 1,000 at December 31, 2003 to approximately 1,500 at December 31, 2004. In addition, our consultant costs increased by approximately $13.4 million. Product development expenses are expected to increase in total and may increase slightly as a percentage of net revenues in 2005, as we develop new site features and functionality and continue to improve and expand operations across all our segments including the U.S. Marketplace, China, and PayPal Merchant Services. The increase in product development expenses in 2003, as compared to the prior year, was primarily the result of increased headcount and computer equipment depreciation. These increases were partially offset by the amounts capitalized in connection with major site and other product development efforts in 2003. The headcount growth was focused on hiring new employees for various platform development initiatives at eBay and PayPal. Our product development employees increased approximately 59% from approximately 600 at December 31, 2002 to approximately 1,000 at December 31, 2003. General and Administrative Percent Percent 2002 Change 2003 Change 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) General and administrative $ 171,785 76 % $ 302,703 37 % $ 415,725 As a percentage of net revenues 14.1 % 14.0 % 12.7 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, provisions for transaction losses associated with our Payments segment, depreciation of equipment, provision for doubtful accounts, insurance and professional fees. General and administrative expenses increased in total, but decreased as a percentage of net revenues in 2004, as compared to the prior year. The dollar increase was due primarily to employee related costs, fees for external professional advisors, including Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs, and payment transaction loss expenses. The increases in employee related costs resulted from growth in the finance, human resource and legal departments to meet the demands of our expanding business, including growing international operations, increased regulatory demands, and the integration of acquired businesses. We increased our general and administrative employees from approximately 1,900 at December 31, 2003 to approximately 2,700 at December 31, 2004. This increase related primarily to the addition of employees in our eBay trust and safety functions. Consultant and employee related costs increased by approximately $53.8 million during 2004 as compared to the prior year. PayPals payment transaction loss increased by approximately $14.1 million, to $50.5 million at December 31, 2004, reflecting the increase in activity in the Payments segment in addition to the expansion of our PayPal Buyer Protection Program. PayPals payment transaction loss rate, which is the transaction loss expense as a percentage of PayPals total payment volume, was 0.27% in 2004 compared to 0.30% in 2003. The decrease in this percentage from 2003 to 2004 was offset in part by the increase in coverage for our PayPal Buyer Protection Program. With our continued investment, primarily in the expansion in our Marketplace and Payments segments, and related corporate functions, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase during 2005. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2003 was due primarily to employee and facilities related costs, fees for external professional advisors, payment transaction loss expenses resulting from our acquisition of PayPal and charges associated with various legal matters. The increases in employee and facilities related costs resulted from the addition of PayPal employees in various trust and safety functions as well as continued headcount growth in the finance, human resource and legal departments to meet the demands of our expanding business, including growing international operations and the integration of acquired businesses. We increased our general and administrative staff from approximately 1,300 at December 31, 2002 to approximately 1,900 at December 31, 2003. Fees for external professional advisors increased by $10.4 mil 27 Table of Contents lion. Charges associated with various legal matters recorded in general and administrative expense totaled $8.6 million. PayPals payment transaction loss increased $28.6 million in 2003, reflecting a full year of consolidated operations. In February 2004, we began migrating eBay users from our legacy billing system to a newly implemented billing system. As we managed this migration, we delayed billing cycles to facilitate the migration process and to allow additional time for quality assurance reviews. The delay in billing cycles continued for the remainder of the year and resulted in an increase in the average days our customer account balances were outstanding. Although we believe this change in account balance aging is a temporary condition, our historical experience indicates an increased risk of collection for aged accounts receivable balances. Accordingly, our provision for doubtful accounts during the year ended December 31, 2004 increased to a total of $85.4 million, or 2.6% of net revenues, compared to $44.3 million, or 2.0% of net revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2003. The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable at December 31, 2004 was $67.9 million. Patent Litigation Expense Percent Percent 2002 Change 2003 Change 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Patent litigation expense $ N/A $ 29,965 N/A $ As a percentage of net revenues N/A 1.4 % N/A Patent litigation expense during 2003 relates to the accrual of an August 6, 2003 court judgment resulting from the MercExchange patent infringement lawsuit. See Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Payroll Tax on Employee Stock Options Percent Percent 2002 Change 2003 Change 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Payroll tax on employee stock options $ 4,015 139 % $ 9,590 82 % $ 17,479 As a percentage of net revenues 0.3 % 0.4 % 0.5 % We are subject to employer payroll taxes on employee gains from the exercise of non qualified stock options. These employer payroll taxes are recorded as a charge to operations in the period in which such options are exercised and sold based on actual gains realized by employees. The increases in 2004 and 2003 as compared to the respective prior years were primarily a result of larger individual gains recognized on stock option exercises by our employees during periods in which our stock price was high relative to historic levels. Our results of operations and cash flows could vary significantly depending on the actual period that stock options are exercised by employees and, consequently, the amount of employer payroll taxes assessed. In general, we expect payroll taxes on employee stock option gains to increase during periods in which our stock price is high relative to historic levels. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets Percent Percent 2002 Change 2003 Change 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 15,941 218 % $ 50,659 30 % $ 65,927 As a percentage of net revenues 1.3 % 2.3 % 2.0 % From time to time we have purchased, and we expect to continue purchasing, assets or businesses to accelerate category and geographic expansion, increase the features, functions, and formats available to our users and maintain a leading role in online trading. These purchase transactions generally result in the creation of acquired intangible assets and lead to a corresponding increase in the amortization expense in future periods. 28 Table of Contents Intangible assets include purchased customer lists and user base, trademarks and trade names, developed technologies, and other intangible assets. We amortize intangible assets, excluding goodwill, using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from one to eight years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment, applying a fair value based test. We evaluate goodwill, at a minimum, on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies data. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. Our annual impairment test was carried out as of August 31, 2004 and we determined that there was no impairment. There were no events or circumstances from that date through December 31, 2004 that would impact this assessment. We expect amortization of acquired intangible assets will increase in 2005 as a result of the intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of mobile.de and Marktplaats.nl, as well as our additional investment in Internet Auction during 2004 and our recent acquisition of Rent.com. Amortization of acquired intangible assets will also increase should we make additional acquisitions in the future. Non Operating Items Interest and Other Income, Net Percent Percent 2002 Change 2003 Change 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Interest and other income, net $ 49,209 (23 )% $ 37,803 106 % $ 77,867 As a percentage of net revenues 4.1 % 1.7 % 2.4 % Interest and other income, net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments as well as foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and other non operating transactions. Our interest and other income, net increased in total and as a percentage of net revenues during 2004 as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of gains from the sale of an equity investment and amendments to certain sublease agreements. In addition, we recorded increased interest income primarily due to higher investment balances, and increased cash and cash equivalents balances. The weighted average interest rate of our portfolio increased to 1.7% in 2004 from 1.6% in 2003. We expect that interest and other income, net, will remain generally comparable in total to 2004 during 2005. Our interest and other income, net decreased in total and as a percentage of net revenues during 2003, primarily as a result of one time gains recognized in 2002 from the sale of certain subsidiaries, real estate properties and an equity investment that totaled $20.3 million. This decrease was offset, in part, by increased investment income on a larger aggregate balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments even though the weighted average interest rate of our portfolio declined to 1.6% in 2003 from 2.8% in 2002. Interest Expense Percent Percent 2002 Change 2003 Change 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Interest expense $ 1,492 189 % $ 4,314 106 % $ 8,879 As a percentage of net revenues 0.1 % 0.2 % 0.3 % Interest expense consists of interest charges on our consolidated lease arrangement related to our San Jose headquarters office facilities, capital leases, and mortgage notes. 29 Table of Contents In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. In accordance with the provisions of this standard, we have included our San Jose headquarters lease arrangement in our consolidated financial statements effective July 1, 2003. Beginning July 1, 2003, our consolidated statement of income reflects the reclassification of lease payments on our San Jose headquarters office facilities from operating expense to interest expense. The increase in interest expense during 2003, compared to the prior year, was primarily the result of the inclusion of interest payments on our San Jose headquarters office facilities. The increase in interest expense during 2004 is primarily the result of the inclusion of these interest payments for a full year in 2004. We expect our interest expense will decrease both in total and as a percentage of net revenue during 2005 due to the acquisition of the San Jose headquarters office facilities at the expiration of the lease arrangement on March 1, 2005. Impairment of Certain Equity Investments Percent Percent 2002 Change 2003 Change 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Impairment of certain equity investments $ 3,781 (67 )% $ 1,230 N/A $ As a percentage of net revenues 0.3 % 0.1 % N/A During 2003 and 2002, we recorded impairment charges totaling $1.2 million and $3.8 million, respectively, as a result of the deterioration of the financial condition of certain of our private and public equity investees. We identified these impairment losses as part of our normal process of assessing the quality of our investment portfolio. The impairment loss reflects a decline in fair value and other market conditions that we believe are other than temporary. We expect that the fair value of our equity investments will fluctuate from time to time and future impairment assessments may result in additional charges to our operating results. We did not record any impairment of our equity investments during 2004. Provision for Income Taxes Percent Percent 2002 Change 2003 Change 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 145,946 42 % $ 206,738 66 % $ 343,885 As a percentage of net revenues 12.0 % 9.5 % 10.5 % Effective tax rate 37 % 32 % 30 % The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory U.S. federal rate principally due to non deductible expenses related to acquisitions, state taxes, subsidiary losses for which we have not provided a benefit and other factors that increase the effective tax rate. These expenses are partially offset by decreases resulting from foreign income with lower effective tax rates, tax credits, and tax exempt interest income. The lower effective tax rates in 2004 and 2003 as compared to the respective prior years reflect the increasing profit contribution from our international operations that are subject to lower tax rates. We receive tax deductions from the gains realized by employees on the exercise of certain non qualified stock options for which the benefit is recognized as a component of stockholders equity. We have evaluated our deferred tax assets relating to these stock option deductions along with our other deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is required for that portion of the total deferred tax assets that is not considered more likely than not to be realized in future periods. To the extent that the deferred tax assets with a full valuation allowance become realizable in future periods, we will have the ability, subject to carryforward limitations, to use up to $158.6 million of deferred tax assets to reduce future income tax liabilities. Should a valuation allowance no longer be required, the reversal of the valuation allowance will be reflected as an increase in additional paid in capital rather than a reduction of the income tax provision. 30 Table of Contents Minority Interests Percent Percent 2002 Change 2003 Change 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Minority interests $ (2,296 ) (230 )% $ (7,578 ) 19 % $ (6,122 ) As a percentage of net revenues 0.2 % 0.4 % 0.2 % Minority interests represents the minority investors percentage share of income or losses from subsidiaries in which we hold a majority ownership interest and consolidate the subsidiaries results in our financial statements. Third parties held minority interests in various of our subsidiaries during 2004, 2003 and 2002. The change in minority interests in 2004 is due primarily to our acquisition of an additional 37.9% ownership interest in Internet Auction. The change in minority interests in 2003 primarily resulted from the minority interests portion of the net income generated by Internet Auction. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In accordance with the provisions of FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, we have included our San Jose headquarters lease arrangement in our consolidated financial statements effective July 1, 2003. Our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2003 reflects the reclassification of lease payments on our San Jose headquarters from operating expense to interest expense, beginning with the quarters following our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003, a $5.4 million after tax charge for cumulative depreciation for periods from lease inception through June 30, 2003, and incremental depreciation expense of approximately $400,000, net of tax, per quarter for periods after June 30, 2003. We have adopted the provisions of FIN 46 prospectively from July 1, 2003, and as a result, have not restated prior periods. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle arising from the adoption of FIN 46 has been reflected in net income in 2003. Impact of Foreign Currency Translation During 2004, our international net revenues, based upon the country in which the seller, payment recipient, advertiser or other service provider is located, accounted for approximately 42% of our consolidated net revenues, as compared to 35% of our net revenues in 2003 and 26% of our net revenues in 2002. The growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Net revenues and related expenses generated from international locations are denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries, and include Euros, British pounds, Korean won, Canadian dollars, Taiwanese dollars, and Australian dollars. The results of operations and certain of our inter company balances associated with our international locations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The statements of income of our international operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period. To the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased consolidated net revenues, operating expenses and net income. Similarly, our consolidated net revenues, operating expenses and net income will decrease when the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies. During 2004, the U.S. dollar weakened against the foreign currencies listed above. Using the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates from 2003, our net revenues for 2004 would have been lower than we reported using the actual exchange rates for 2004 by approximately $129.9 million, of which $117.0 million and $12.9 million relate to our International Marketplace and Payments segments, respectively. In addition, if the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates from 2003 were applied to our cost of revenues and operating expenses for 2004, these costs of revenues and operating expenses would have been lower in total than we reported using the actual exchange rates for 2004 by approximately $58.4 million. The majority of this impact relates to the relative strength of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. 31 Table of Contents We expect our international operations will continue to grow in significance as we develop and deploy our global marketplace and global payments platform. As a result, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in future periods could become more significant and may have a negative impact on our consolidated net revenues and net income. See the information in Item 7A under Foreign Currency Risk for additional discussion of the impact of foreign currency translation and related hedging activities. Foreign Exchange Hedging Policy We are a rapidly growing company, with an increasing proportion of our operations outside the United States. Accordingly, our foreign currency exposures have increased substantially and are expected to continue to grow. The objective of our foreign exchange exposure management program is to identify material foreign currency exposures and to manage these exposures to minimize the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows, and results of operations. Our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction, economic and translation: Transaction Exposure: Around the world, we have certain assets and liabilities, primarily receivables, investments and accounts payable (including inter company transactions) that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional currency. In certain circumstances, changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other instruments to minimize the short term foreign currency fluctuations on such assets and liabilities. The gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset the transaction gains and losses on certain foreign currency receivables, investments and payables recognized in earnings. Economic Exposure: We also have anticipated and unrecognized future cash flows, including revenues and expenses, denominated in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional currency. Our primary economic exposures include future royalty receivables, customer collections, and vendor payments. Changes in the relevant entitys functional currency value will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge the value of a portion of these cash flows. We account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the transaction is settled. Earnings Translation Exposure: As our international operations grow, fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign denominated subsidiaries. We may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset the earnings impact of currency fluctuations. Such contracts will be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss recorded in interest and other income, net. Employee Stock Options We continue to believe that employee stock options represent an appropriate and essential component of our overall compensation program. We grant options to substantially all employees and believe that this broad based program helps us to attract, motivate, and retain high quality employees, to the ultimate benefit of our stockholders. Stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, net of cancellations, represented approximately 3% of our total outstanding common stock at December 31, 2004 and 2003, a substantial portion of which was granted to new employees. We expect that our stock option grants, net of cancellations, for 2005 will represent approximately 2% of our total outstanding common stock at December 31, 2005. 32 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Share Based Payments In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (FAS 123R) that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. The statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board, or APB, Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our consolidated statement of income. The statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options. We currently use the Black Scholes option pricing model to value options and are currently assessing which model we may use in the future under the statement and may deem an alternative model to be the most appropriate. The use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than the use of the Black Scholes option pricing model. In addition, there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that will result in differing accounting treatment than currently required. These differences include, but are not limited to, the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options and for stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan. In addition to the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments, we will also be required to determine the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The allowed transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options. Under the retroactive options, prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented. The prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of FAS 123R, while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated. The effective date of the new standard for our consolidated financial statements is our third fiscal quarter in 2005. Upon adoption, this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan rather than disclose the impact on our consolidated net income within our footnotes as is our current practice (see Note 1 of the notes of the consolidated financial statements contained herein). The amounts disclosed within our footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of FAS 123R. Compensation expense calculated under FAS 123R may differ from amounts currently disclosed within our footnotes based on changes in the fair value of our common stock, changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options, the treatment of tax benefits and changes in interest rates or other factors. In addition, upon adoption of FAS 123R we may choose to use a different valuation model to value the compensation expense associated with employee stock options. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions (SFAS 153). SFAS 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. This standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have on our consolidated statement of income and financial condition. 33 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, 2002 2003 2004 (In thousands) Consolidated Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 479,903 $ 874,119 $ 1,285,315 Investing activities (157,759 ) (1,319,542 ) (2,013,220 ) Financing activities 252,067 688,866 647,669 Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 11,133 28,757 28,768 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 585,344 $ 272,200 $ (51,468 ) We have generated annual cash provided by operating activities in amounts greater than net income in 2004, 2003 and 2002. This result was driven mainly by non cash charges to earnings. Non cash charges to earnings included depreciation and amortization on our long term assets, tax benefits on the exercise of employee stock options resulting from our increasing stock price and the related increases in the personal gains recognized by our employees, provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits resulting from increasing revenues and the provision for transaction losses resulting from increased total payment volumes processed by our PayPal subsidiary. In 2003 and 2002, operating cash flows were also positively impacted by the net cash amounts provided by year over year changes in working capital assets and liabilities. The net cash used in investing activities in 2004, 2003 and 2002 reflected primarily the movement of cash and cash equivalents between cash and cash equivalents and investments, the purchase of property and equipment, and acquisitions. Purchases of property and equipment, net totaled $292.8 million in 2004, $365.4 million in 2003, and $138.7 million in 2002. Purchases of property and equipment in 2004 and 2002 related mainly to purchases of computer equipment and software to support our site operations, customer support and international expansion. In 2003, purchases of property and equipment included the $125.1 million purchase of additional office space in San Jose, California. Purchases of property and equipment in 2003 also included amounts for improvements to various facilities in the U.S. and around the world as well as computer equipment and software to support our site operations, customer support and international expansion. Cash expended for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, totaled approximately $1.0 billion in 2004, $216.4 million in 2003 and $59.4 million in 2002. In 2004, our cash acquisitions included the acquisition of mobile.de, Baazee.com, and Marktplaats.nl, as well as an additional ownership interest in Internet Auction Co. Our cash acquisitions in 2003 included acquiring the remaining ownership interest in EachNet and an additional ownership interest in Internet Auction Co. Our cash acquisitions in 2002 included acquiring the remaining ownership interest in our Billpoint subsidiary and a 38% interest in EachNet, located in China. We completed our acquisition of PayPal during 2002 through the exchange of our common stock for PayPals then outstanding common stock. The net cash flows provided by financing activities in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were due primarily to proceeds from stock option exercises. Proceeds from stock option exercises totaled $650.6 million in 2004, $700.8 million in 2003, and $252.2 million in 2002. Our future cash flows from stock options are difficult to project as such amounts are a function of our stock price, the number of options outstanding and the decisions by employees to exercise stock options. In general, we expect proceeds from stock option exercises to increase during periods in which our stock price has increased relative to historical levels. The positive effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2004, 2003, and 2002 was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, together with any cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations for the 34 Table of Contents foreseeable future. However, if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flows from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, our business could suffer. We expect capital expenditures to amount to between $340 million and $400 million during 2005, without taking into account any acquisitions or the $126 million associated with the purchase of our San Jose headquarters facility. On February 23, 2005, we paid $415 million, net of Rent.coms cash on hand, to acquire all of the outstanding securities of Rent.com. See Subsequent Events within this section for further details. Commitments and Contingencies We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables, in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments (in thousands): Other Payment Due By Year Ending Capital Operating Purchase December 31, Leases Leases Obligations Total 2005 $ 128,164 $ 19,987 $ 397,176 $ 545,327 2006 75 15,522 64,505 80,102 2007 11,238 12,353 23,591 2008 9,371 2,958 12,329 2009 7,435 7,435 Thereafter 26,634 26,634 $ 128,239 $ 90,187 $ 476,992 $ 695,418 Capital lease amounts primarily comprises the assumed purchase of the corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, in March 2005, when the lease is scheduled to expire, and includes the $3.9 million in relation to the non controlling minority interest. See Note 8 Long Term Obligations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non cancelable operating leases for office facilities, as well as limited computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to exit an office facility early or expand our occupied space. Other purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, computer equipment, software applications, a corporate airplane, engineering development services and other goods and services that were entered into through our ordinary course of business. For those contractual arrangements in which there are significant performance requirements, we have developed estimates to project expected payment obligations. These estimates have been developed based upon historical trends, when available, and our anticipated future obligations. Given the significance of such performance requirements within our advertising and other arrangements, actual payments could differ significantly from these estimates. Other Financial Arrangements As of December 31, 2004, we had no off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have, a future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 35 Table of Contents Indemnification Provisions In the ordinary course of business we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application programming interface license agreements. Under these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by any third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement. In a limited number of agreements, including agreements under which we have developed technology for certain commercial parties, we have provided an indemnity for other types of third party claims, substantially all of which are indemnities related to our copyrights, trademarks, and patents. To date, no significant costs have been incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection with our indemnification provisions. Subsequent Events On February 23, 2005, we acquired all outstanding securities of Rent.com for approximately $415 million plus our acquisition costs, net of Rent.coms cash on hand. Rent.com is a leading Internet listing website in the apartment and rental housing industry. In January 2005, our Board of Directors approved a two for one split of our shares of common stock to be issued in the form of a stock dividend. As a result of the stock split, our stockholders received one additional share of our common stock for each share of common stock held of record on January 31, 2005. The additional shares of our common stock were distributed on February 16, 2005. All share and per share amounts in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split for all periods presented. Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates General The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this report. 36 Table of Contents Provisions for Doubtful Accounts and Authorized Credits Our U.S. Marketplace and International Marketplace segments are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and credits to sellers. Provisions for these items represent our estimate of actual losses and credits based on our historical experience, are monitored monthly, and are made at the time the related revenue is recognized. The provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to operating expense, while the authorized credits are recorded as a reduction of revenues. The following table illustrates the provision related to doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a percentage of net revenues for 2002, 2003, and 2004 (in thousands, except percentages). Years Ended December 31, 2002 2003 2004 Net revenues from the U.S. and International Marketplace segments $ 1,118,732 $ 1,727,474 $ 2,573,607 Provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits $ 25,455 $ 46,049 $ 90,942 Provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a % of net revenues from the U.S. and International Marketplace segments 2.28 % 2.67 % 3.53 % Historically, our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions. However, future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of income and cash flows. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 25 basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income of approximately $6.4 million. The following analysis demonstrates, for illustrative purposes only, the potential effect a 25 basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands, except per share data): 25 Basis +25 Basis Points 2004 Points Income from operating impact related to doubtful accounts and authorized credits $ 84,508 $ 90,942 $ 97,376 Income from operations 1,065,676 1,059,242 1,052,808 Net income 784,657 778,223 771,789 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.57 $ 0.57 $ 0.56 Provision for Transaction Losses Our Payments segment is exposed to transaction losses due to credit card and other payment misuse, as well as non performance of sellers who accept payment through PayPal. We establish allowances for estimated losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as charge backs for unauthorized credit card use and merchant related charge backs due to non delivery of goods or services, ACH returns, and debit card overdrafts. These allowances represent an accumulation of the estimated amounts, using an actuarial technique, necessary to provide for transaction losses incurred as of the reporting date, including those of which we have not yet been notified. The allowances are monitored monthly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors. The allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including our experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types. The provision for transaction loss expense is reflected as a general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2004, the transaction loss reserve totaled $11.0 million and was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. 37 Table of Contents The following table illustrates the provision for transaction loss expense as a percentage of total payment volume from PayPal operations for the period from October 3, 2002 (date of acquisition of PayPal) through December 31, 2002 and for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 (in thousands, except percentages). Period from October 3, 2002 through Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2002 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 Total payment volume $ 2,138,000 $ 12,226,000 $ 18,915,000 Transaction loss expense $ 7,832 $ 36,401 $ 50,459 As a % of total payment volume 0.37 % 0.30 % 0.27 % The establishment of appropriate allowances for transaction losses is an inherently uncertain process, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2004, a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our operating expenses of approximately $9.5 million. The following analysis demonstrates, for illustrative purposes only, the potential effect a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands, except per share data): 5 Basis +5 Basis Points 2004 Points Transaction loss expense $ 41,003 $ 50,459 $ 59,915 Income from operations 1,068,698 1,059,242 1,049,786 Net income 787,679 778,223 768,767 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.58 $ 0.57 $ 0.56 Legal Contingencies In connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events. From time to time, we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we do not expect this trend to change in the future. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in Item 3: Legal Proceedings and Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies Litigation and Other Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements, which we incorporate herein. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us, and we will defend ourselves vigorously. However, even if successful, our defense against certain actions will be costly and could divert our managements time. If the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims, we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business. Any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of all or any of our three segments. Accounting for Income Taxes We are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon the taxable income and temporary differences for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws around the world and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities, including various accruals, allowances, depreciation and amortization. The tax effect of these temporary differences and the estimated tax benefit from our tax net operating losses are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We also 38 Table of Contents assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax asset will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our tax provision in our consolidated statement of income. Where the change in the valuation allowance relates to the deduction for employee stock option exercises, the change is reflected as a credit to additional paid in capital. As employee stock option exercises are highly dependent upon our stock price, it is extremely difficult to predict the amount of deductions that will be generated from future option exercises and, therefore, for us to ascertain the amount of deferred tax assets related to employee stock option exercises that may be realized in future periods. At December 31, 2004, we have maintained an allowance on certain net operating losses generated from deductions for employee stock option expenses based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to these net operating losses will not be realized. The deferred tax asset, net of a valuation allowance of $158.6 million, totaled $58.1 million at December 31, 2004 and was offset by deferred tax liabilities of $183.7 million resulting in a net deferred tax liability of $125.5 million. In addition, due to our significant anticipated international expansion, we have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on non U.S. subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2004, because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. In the event that our future international expansion plans change and such amounts are not reinvested indefinitely, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes partially offset by foreign tax credits. The following table illustrates the effective tax rates for 2002, 2003, and 2004 (in thousands, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2003 2004 Provision for income taxes $ 145,946 $ 206,738 $ 343,885 Effective tax rates 37 % 32 % 30 % Historically, these provisions have adequately provided for our actual income tax liabilities. However, unexpected or significant future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of income and cash flows. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2004, a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately $11.3 million. The following analysis demonstrates, for illustrative purposes only, the potential effect such a one percentage point deviation change would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands, except per share data): 100 Basis +100 Basis Points 2004 Points Provision for income taxes $ 332,603 $ 343,885 $ 355,167 Income from operations 1,070,524 1,059,242 1,047,960 Net income 789,505 778,223 766,941 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.58 $ 0.57 $ 0.56 Advertising and Other Non Transaction Revenues A portion of our net revenues result from fees associated with advertising and other non transaction services in our U.S. Marketplace, International Marketplace and Payments segments. Net revenues from advertising are derived principally from the sale of online banner and sponsorship advertisements for cash and through barter arrangements. Other non transaction net revenues are derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide transaction services to eBay users and from offline services provided by wholly owned subsidiaries that were divested in the second half of 2002. Advertising and other non transaction net revenues, including barter transactions, totaled 9%, 2% and 3% of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively, and were primarily generated by our U.S. Marketplace segment. Revenue from barter arrangements totaled $10.1 million in both 2002 and 2003, and $13.3 million in 2004. Certain judgments are involved in the determination of the appropriate 39 Table of Contents revenue recognition, including, but not limited to, the assessment and allocation of fair values in multiple element arrangements, the appropriateness of gross or net revenue recognition and, for barter transactions, the existence of comparable cash transactions to establish fair values. Our advertising and other non transaction net revenues may be affected by the financial condition of the parties with whom we have these relationships and by the success of online services and promotions in general. Unlike our transaction revenues, advertising and other non transaction net revenues are derived from a relatively concentrated customer base. Business Combinations In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 141, the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital. At December 31, 2004 our goodwill totaled $2.7 billion and our identifiable intangible assets totaled $362.9 million. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of our reportable units annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. This assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization. The estimate of cash flow is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management. Our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to its business model or changes in operating performance. Significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of August 31, 2004 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill for any of our reportable units was required. We have determined that no events have occurred from that date through December 31, 2004 that would require an updated analysis. 40 Table of Contents Risk Factors That May Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. Our operating results may fluctuate. Our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. Factors that may affect our operating results include the following: our ability to retain an active user base, to attract new users, and to encourage existing users to list items for sale, purchase items through our service, or use our payment services; the volume, size, timing, and completion rate of transactions on our websites; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses, operations, and infrastructure; technical difficulties or service interruptions involving our websites or services provided to our users by third parties; the success of our geographic and product expansions; the actions of our competitors, including the introduction of new sites, services, and products; consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions on our websites; the cost and availability of online and traditional advertising, and the success of our brand building and marketing campaigns; new laws or regulations, or interpretations of existing laws or regulations, that harm the Internet, electronic commerce, or our business model; our ability to comply with the requirements of entities whose services are required for our operations, such as credit card associations; our ability to upgrade and develop our systems, infrastructure, and customer service capabilities to accommodate growth at a reasonable cost; the costs and results of litigation that involves us; our ability to keep our websites operational at a reasonable cost; our ability to develop product enhancements at a reasonable cost and to develop programs and features in a timely manner, including expanding our fixed price offerings; our ability to successfully integrate and manage our acquisitions, including, most recently, Rent.com; our ability to manage PayPals transaction loss and credit card chargeback rate and payment funding mix; our ability to expand PayPals product offerings outside of the U.S. (including our ability to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals) and to increase the acceptance of PayPal by online merchants outside of the eBay marketplace; our ability to attract new personnel in a timely and effective manner and to retain key employees; the results of regulatory decisions that affect us; the continued financial strength of our technology suppliers and other parties with whom we have commercial relations; 41 Table of Contents increasing consumer acceptance of the Internet and other online services for commerce in the face of increasing publicity about fraud, spoofing, viruses, and other dangers of the Internet; general economic conditions and those economic conditions specific to the Internet and e commerce industries; and geopolitical events such as war, threat of war, or terrorist actions. Our limited operating history and the increased variety of services offered on our websites make it difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history, we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. We do not have backlog, and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales or payments during that quarter. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues it is also difficult to forecast income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline. We may not maintain our level of profitability or rates of growth. We believe that our continued profitability and growth will depend in large part on our ability to do the following: attract new users and keep existing users active on our websites; manage the costs of our business, including the costs associated with maintaining and developing our websites, customer support, transaction and chargeback rates, and international and product expansion; maintain sufficient transaction volume to attract buyers and sellers; increase the awareness of our brands; and provide our customers with superior community, customer support, and trading experiences. We invest heavily in marketing and promotion, customer support, and further development of operating infrastructure for our core and recently acquired operations. Some of this investment entails long term contractual commitments. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall, which may harm our profitability. In addition, we are spending in advance of anticipated growth, which may also harm our profitability. Growth rates in our most established markets, such as Germany and the U.S., have declined over time and may continue to do so as the existing base of users and transactions becomes larger. The expected future growth of our PayPal business may also cause downward pressure on our profit margin because that business has lower gross margins than our eBay business. System failures could harm our business. We have experienced system failures from time to time, and any interruption in the availability of our websites will reduce our current revenues and profits, could harm our future revenues and profits, and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny. eBays primary website has been interrupted for periods of up to 22 hours, and our PayPal site suffered intermittent unavailability over a five day period in October 2004. Any unscheduled interruption in our services results in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our sites, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. These interruptions increase the burden on our engineering staff, which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new features and services on our sites. Because PayPal is a regulated financial entity, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory inquiries. These inquiries 42 Table of Contents could result in fines, penalties, or mandatory changes to PayPals business practices, and ultimately could cause PayPal to lose existing licenses it needs to operate or prevent it from obtaining additional licenses that it needs to expand. Finally, because our customers may use our products for critical transactions, any system failures could result in damage to our customers businesses. These customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses. Even if unsuccessful, this type of claim likely would be time consuming and costly for us to address. Although our systems have been designed around industry standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, and similar events. Some of our systems, including PayPals customer support operations, are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. Our systems are also subject to break ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision by any of our third party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. In addition, the failure by our hosting facilities to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures. Our growth will depend on our ability to develop our brands, and these efforts may be costly. Our historical growth has been largely attributable to word of mouth, and to frequent and high visibility national and local media coverage. We believe that continuing to strengthen our brands will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services, and will require an increased focus on active marketing efforts. The demand for and cost of online and traditional advertising have been increasing, and may continue to increase. Accordingly, we will need to spend increasing amounts of money on, and devote greater resources to, advertising, marketing, and other efforts to create and maintain brand loyalty among users. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues, and even if they do, any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brands. If we do attract new users to our services, they may not conduct transactions over our services on a regular basis. If we fail to promote and maintain our brands, or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, our business would be harmed. We depend on the continued growth of online commerce. The business of selling goods over the Internet, particularly through online trading, is dynamic and relatively new. Growth in the use of the Internet as a medium for consumer commerce may not continue. Concerns about fraud, privacy, and other problems may discourage additional consumers from adopting the Internet as a medium of commerce. Market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over the Internet is highly uncertain, and there are few proven services and products. In countries such as the U.S., where our services and online commerce generally have been available for some time, acquiring new users for our services may be more difficult and costly than it has been in the past. In order to expand our user base, we must appeal to and acquire consumers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods. If these consumers prove to be less active than our earlier users, and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our operating costs, including our cost of acquiring new customers, our business could be adversely impacted. We must keep pace with rapid technological change to remain competitive. Our competitive arena is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new service and product introductions and enhancements, and changing customer demands. These characteristics are caused in part by the emerging and changing nature of the Internet. Our future success therefore will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards and to improve the performance, features, and reliability of our service. Our failure to adapt to such changes 43 Table of Contents would harm our business. Recent changes in search functionality, including both paid and natural search, may give buyers easier access to Internet sellers who do not use our trading platforms and may provide such sellers with alternative access to buyers. These developments may reduce the attractiveness of our platform to sellers and may adversely affect our growth and business. New technologies, such as the development of a peer to peer personal trading technology, could also adversely affect us. In addition, the widespread adoption of new Internet, networking, or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure. There are many risks associated with our international operations. Our international expansion has been rapid and we have only limited experience in many of the countries in which we now do business. Our international business, especially in Germany, the U.K., Canada, and South Korea, has also become critical to our revenues and profits. In 2004, our international net transaction revenues represented 36% of our total net transaction revenues. Expansion into international markets requires management attention and resources. We have limited experience in localizing our service to conform to local cultures, standards, and policies. The commercial, Internet, and transportation infrastructure in lesser developed countries may make it difficult for us to replicate our business model. In many countries, we compete with local companies who understand the local market better than we do, and we may not benefit from first to market advantages. We may not be successful in expanding into particular international markets or in generating revenues from foreign operations. For example, in 2002 we withdrew from the Japanese market. Even if we are successful, we expect the costs of operating new sites to exceed our net revenues for at least 12 months in most countries. As we continue to expand internationally, including through the expansion of PayPal, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including the following: regulatory requirements, including regulation of auctioneering, professional selling, distance selling, banking, and money transmitting, that may limit or prevent the offering of eBays and PayPals services in some jurisdictions, prevent enforceable agreements between sellers and buyers, prohibit the listing of certain categories of goods, require special licensure, or limit the transfer of information between eBay and our affiliates; legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the listings and other content provided by our users, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet friendly legal systems, unique local laws, and lack of clear precedent or applicable law; difficulties in integrating with local payment providers, including banks, credit and debit card associations, and electronic fund transfer systems; differing levels of retail distribution, shipping, and communications infrastructures; different employee/employer relationships and the existence of workers councils and labor unions; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; longer payment cycles, different accounting practices, and greater problems in collecting accounts receivable; potentially adverse tax consequences, including local taxation of our fees or of transactions on our websites; higher telecommunications and Internet service provider costs; strong local competitors; different and more stringent consumer protection, data protection and other laws; cultural ambivalence towards, or non acceptance of, online trading; seasonal reductions in business activity; 44 Table of Contents expenses associated with localizing our products, including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency; laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit foreign ownership of certain businesses; profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange restrictions, and exchange rate fluctuations; volatility in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions; and differing intellectual property laws. Some of these factors may cause our international costs of doing business to exceed our comparable domestic costs. As we expand our international operations and have additional portions of our international revenues denominated in foreign currencies, we also could become subject to increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations is discussed in more detail under We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, below. We are in the process of expanding PayPals services internationally. Both eBay and PayPal have limited experience with the payments business outside of the U.S. In some countries, expansion of PayPals business may require a close commercial relationship with one or more local banks. We do not know if these or other factors may prevent, delay, or limit PayPals expansion or reduce its profitability. Any limitation on our ability to expand PayPal internationally could harm our business. Our operations in China are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the laws and regulations of the Peoples Republic of China. In July 2003, we completed the acquisition of the remaining outstanding capital stock and options of EachNet. EachNet is a Delaware corporation and a foreign person under the laws of the Peoples Republic of China, or PRC, and is subject to many of the risks of doing business internationally described above in There are many risks associated with our international operations. The PRC currently regulates its Internet sector through regulations restricting the scope of foreign investment and through the enforcement of content restrictions on the Internet. While many aspects of these regulations remain unclear, they purport to limit and require licensing of various aspects of the provision of Internet information services. These regulations have created substantial uncertainties regarding the legality of foreign investments in PRC Internet companies, including EachNet, and the business operations of such companies. In order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements, the new eBay EachNet website is operated through a foreign owned enterprise indirectly owned by eBays European operating entity, which acts in cooperation with a local PRC company owned by certain local employees. We believe EachNets current ownership structure complies with all existing PRC laws, rules, and regulations. There are, however, substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of current PRC laws and regulations, and it is possible that the PRC government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. There are also uncertainties regarding EachNets ability to enforce contractual relationships it has entered into with respect to management and control of the companys business. If EachNet were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, it could be subject to fines and other financial penalties, have its business and Internet content provider licenses revoked, or be forced to discontinue its business entirely. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Net revenues outside the United States accounted for approximately 42% of our net revenues in 2004. Because we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States but report our results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates. In connection with its multi currency service, PayPal fixes exchange rates twice per day, and may face financial exposure if it incorrectly fixes the exchange rate. PayPal also holds some corporate funds in non U.S. currencies to facilitate customer withdrawals, and thus its financial results are affected by the translation of these non U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars. In addition, the results of operations of our internationally focused websites are exposed to 45 Table of Contents foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, as it did in 2004, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues, operating expenses, and net income. The change in weighted average foreign currency exchange rates in 2004 relative to the comparable rates used in preparation of our consolidated 2003 financial statements resulted in an increase in net revenues of approximately $129.9 million and an increase in aggregate cost of revenues and operating expenses of approximately $58.4 million. Similarly, our net revenues, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies. As exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results, when translated, may differ materially from expectations. In particular, to the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Euro and British Pound, our European revenues and profits will be reduced as a result of these translation adjustments. In addition, to the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Euro and the British Pound, cross border trade related to purchases of dollar denominated goods by non U.S. purchasers may decrease, and that decrease may not be offset by a corresponding increase in cross border trade involving purchases by U.S. buyers of goods denominated in other currencies. While we from time to time enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure, these hedges are relatively costly and, even with them in effect, it is impossible to perfectly predict or completely eliminate the effects of this exposure. Our business and users may be subject to sales tax and other taxes. The application of indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax, value added tax, or VAT, goods and services tax, business tax, and gross receipt tax) to e commerce businesses such as eBay and our users is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the Internet and e commerce. In many cases, it is not clear how existing statutes apply to the Internet or e commerce. In addition, some jurisdictions have implemented or may implement laws specifically addressing the Internet or some aspect of e commerce. The application of existing, new, or future laws could have adverse effects on our business. Several proposals have been made at the U.S. state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services through the Internet. These proposals, if adopted, could substantially impair the growth of e commerce, and could diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities. In December 2004, the U.S. federal government enacted legislation extending the moratorium on states and other local authorities imposing access or discriminatory taxes on the Internet through November 2007. This moratorium does not prohibit federal, state, or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income or from collecting taxes that are due under existing tax rules. In conjunction with the Streamlined Sales Tax Project, the U.S. Congress continues to consider overriding the Supreme Courts Quill decision, which limits the ability of state governments to require sellers outside of their own state to collect and remit sales taxes on goods purchased by in state residents. An overturning of the Quill decision would harm our users and our business. We do not collect taxes on the goods or services sold by users of our services. One or more states or foreign countries may seek to impose a tax collection or reporting, or record keeping obligation on companies such as eBay that engage in or facilitate e commerce. Such an obligation could be imposed if eBay were ever deemed to be the legal agent of eBay sellers by a jurisdiction in which eBay operates. A successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that we should collect taxes on the exchange of merchandise or services on our websites would harm our business. In July 2003, in compliance with the changes brought about by the European Union (EU) VAT directive on electronically supplied services, eBay began collecting VAT on the fees charged to EU sellers on eBay sites catering to EU residents. eBay also pays input VAT to suppliers within the various countries the company operates. In most cases, eBay is entitled to reclaim input VAT from the various countries with regard to our own payments to suppliers or vendors. However, because of our unique business model, the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain. A successful assertion by one or more countries that eBay is not entitled to reclaim VAT would harm our business. 46 Table of Contents We continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify eBays obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations. Passage of new legislation and the imposition of additional tax requirements could harm eBay sellers and our business. There have been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which eBay conducts or will conduct business. Fraudulent activities on our websites and disputes between users of our services may harm our business. PayPal faces significant risks of loss due to fraud and disputes between senders and recipients, including: merchant fraud and other disputes over the quality of goods and services; unauthorized use of credit card and bank account information and identity theft; the need to provide effective customer support to process disputes between senders and recipients; potential breaches of system security; potential employee fraud; and use of PayPals system by customers to make or accept payment for illegal or improper purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2004, PayPals transaction loss expense totaled $50.5 million, representing 0.27% of PayPals total payment volume. Failure to deal effectively with fraudulent transactions and customer disputes would increase PayPals loss rate and harm its business. PayPals highly automated and liquid payment service makes PayPal an attractive target for fraud. In configuring its service, PayPal faces an inherent trade off between customer convenience and security. Identity thieves and those committing fraud using stolen credit card or bank account numbers can potentially steal large amounts of money from businesses such as PayPal. We believe that several of PayPals current and former competitors in the electronic payments business have gone out of business or significantly restricted their businesses largely due to losses from this type of fraud. We expect that technically knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent PayPals anti fraud systems. In addition, PayPals service could be subject to employee fraud or other internal security breaches, and PayPal would be required to reimburse customers for any funds stolen as a result of such breaches. PayPal incurs substantial losses from merchant fraud, including claims from customers that merchants have not performed or that their goods or services do not match the merchants description. PayPal also incurs losses from claims that the customer did not authorize the purchase, from erroneous transmissions and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments. In addition to the direct costs of such losses, if they are related to credit card transactions and become excessive they could result in PayPal losing the right to accept credit cards for payment. If PayPal were unable to accept credit cards, the velocity of trade on eBay could decrease, in which case our business would further suffer. PayPal has been assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks in the past, and excessive chargebacks may arise in the future. PayPal has taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures may not be effective. If these measures do not succeed, our business will suffer. In October 2003, PayPal launched a buyer protection program that refunds to buyers up to $500 in certain eBay transactions if they do not receive the goods they purchased or if the goods differ significantly from what was described by the seller. In November 2004, PayPal increased the amount of protection available under its buyer protection program to $1,000. If PayPal makes such a refund, it seeks to collect reimbursement from the seller, but may not be able to receive any funds from the seller. The PayPal buyer protection program has increased PayPals loss rate and could cause future fluctuations. eBay faces similar risks to those of PayPal with respect to fraudulent activities, although eBays risks may to some extent be less significant. eBay periodically receives complaints from users who may not have received the goods that they had purchased. In some cases individuals have been arrested and convicted for fraudulent activities using our websites. eBay also receives complaints from sellers who have not received payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase. Non payment may occur because of miscommunication, because a buyer has changed his or her mind and decided not to honor the contract to purchase the item, or because the buyer bid on the item maliciously, in order to harm either the seller or eBay. In some European 47 Table of Contents jurisdictions, buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a specified time period. While eBay can suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their payment or delivery obligations to other users, eBay does not have the ability to require users to make payment or deliver goods, or otherwise make users whole other than through our limited buyer protection programs. Other than through these programs, eBay does not compensate users who believe they have been defrauded by other users. eBay also periodically receives complaints from buyers as to the quality of the goods purchased. We expect to continue to receive communications from users requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal action against us if no reimbursement is made. Our liability for these sort of claims is only beginning to be clarified and may be higher in some non U.S. jurisdictions than it is in the U.S. Litigation involving liability for third party actions could be costly for us, divert management attention, result in increased costs of doing business, lead to adverse judgments, or otherwise harm our business. In addition, affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that could take action against us, including imposing fines or seeking injunctions. Negative publicity and user sentiment generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our eBay and PayPal services could damage our reputation, reduce our ability to attract new users or retain our current users, and diminish the value of our brand names. Changes to credit card association fees, rules, or practices or its users credit card usage rates could negatively affect PayPals business. Because PayPal is not a bank, it cannot belong to or directly access credit card associations, such as Visa and MasterCard. As a result, PayPal must rely on banks or payment processors to process transactions, and must pay a fee for this service. From time to time, credit card associations may increase the interchange fees that they charge for each transaction using one of their cards. MasterCard has announced an increase in the standard interchange fee for credit cards in online commerce transactions effective April 2005. PayPals credit card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees on to PayPal as well as increase their own fees for processing. Such increased fees increase PayPals operating costs and reduce its profit margins. PayPal is also required by its processors to comply with credit card association operating rules, and PayPal has agreed to reimburse its processors for any fines they are assessed by credit card associations as a result of processing payments for PayPal. The credit card associations and their member banks set and interpret the credit card rules. Some of those member banks compete with PayPal. Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover could adopt new operating rules or re interpret existing rules that PayPal or its processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow. As a result, PayPal could lose its ability to give customers the option of using credit cards to fund their payments. If PayPal were unable to accept credit cards, its business would be seriously damaged. In addition, the velocity of trade on eBay could decrease and our business would further suffer. In 2002, both Visa and MasterCard adopted new operating rules for Internet payment services like PayPal. In order to comply with the associations new rules, PayPal and its credit card processors have implemented changes to existing business processes for merchant customers. Any problems with this implementation could result in fines, the amount of which would be within Visas and MasterCards discretion. PayPal also could be subject to fines from MasterCard and Visa if it fails to register and conduct additional monitoring with respect to the activities of merchants that are considered high risk, primarily certain merchants that sell digital content. PayPal has incurred fines from its credit card processor in 2003 and 2004 relating to PayPals failure to detect the use of its service by certain high risk merchants using the PayPal service. The amount of these fines has not been material, but any additional fines in the future would likely be for larger amounts, could become material, and could result in a termination of PayPals ability to accept credit cards, which would seriously damage PayPals business. PayPal pays significant transaction fees when senders fund payment transactions using credit cards, nominal fees when customers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, and no fees when customers fund payment transactions from an existing PayPal account balance. Senders funded 53% of PayPals payment volume during 2004 using credit cards, and PayPals financial success will 48 Table of Contents remain highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which its senders fund payments using credit cards. Senders may prefer funding using credit cards rather than bank account transfers for a number of reasons, including the ability to dispute and reverse charges if merchandise is not delivered or is not as described, the ability to earn frequent flier miles or other incentives offered by credit cards, the ability to defer payment, or a reluctance to provide bank account information to PayPal. If PayPal were found to be subject to or in violation of any U.S. laws or regulations governing banking, money transmission, or electronic funds transfers, it could be subject to liability and forced to change its business practices. We believe that the licensing or approval requirements of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, and other federal or state agencies that regulate banks, bank holding companies, or other types of providers of e commerce services do not apply to PayPal, except for certain money transmitter licenses mentioned below. However, PayPal has in the past received written communications from state regulatory authorities expressing the view that its service might constitute an unauthorized banking business. PayPal has taken steps to address these states concerns. However, we cannot guarantee that the steps PayPal has taken to address these regulatory concerns will be effective in all states, and one or more states may conclude that PayPal is engaged in an unauthorized banking business. If PayPal is found to be engaged in an unauthorized banking business in one or more states, it might be subject to monetary penalties and adverse publicity and might be required to cease doing business with residents of those states. Even if the steps it has taken to resolve these states concerns are deemed sufficient by the state regulatory authorities, PayPal could be subject to fines and penalties for its prior activities. The need to comply with state laws prohibiting unauthorized banking activities could also limit PayPals ability to enhance its services in the future. Any change to PayPals business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the velocity of trade on eBay, which would further harm our business. A number of U.S. states have enacted legislation regulating money transmitters. To date, PayPal has obtained licenses in 32 of these jurisdictions and interpretations in nine states that licensing is not required under their existing statutes. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to bonding requirements, restrictions on its investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. If PayPals pending applications were denied, or if it were found to be subject to and in violation of any money services laws or regulations, PayPal also could be subject to liability, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states, or forced to change its business practices. Any change to PayPals business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the velocity of trade on eBay, which would further harm our business. Even if PayPal is not forced to change its business practices, it could be required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on PayPal. Although there have been no definitive interpretations to date, PayPal has assumed that its service is subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E of the Federal Reserve Board. As a result, among other things, PayPal must provide advance disclosure of changes to its service, follow specified error resolution procedures and absorb losses above $50 from transactions not authorized by the consumer. In addition, PayPal is subject to the financial privacy provisions of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, state financial privacy laws, and related regulations. As a result, some customer financial information that PayPal receives is subject to limitations on reuse and disclosure. Existing and potential future privacy laws may limit PayPals ability to develop new products and services that make use of data gathered through its service. The provisions of these laws and related regulations are complicated, and PayPal does not have extensive experience in complying with them. Even technical violations of these laws can result in penalties of up to $1,000 for each non compliant transaction. PayPal processed an average of approximately 929,000 transactions per day during 2004, and any violations could expose PayPal to significant liability. 49 Table of Contents PayPals status under banking or financial services laws or other laws in countries outside the U.S. is unclear. PayPal currently allows its customers with credit cards to send payments from 44 countries outside the U.S., and to receive payments in 43 of those countries. In 23 of these countries, customers can withdraw funds to local bank accounts, and in eight of these countries customers can withdraw funds by receiving a bank draft in the mail. PayPal offers customers the ability to send or receive payments denominated in U.S. Dollars, British Pounds, Euros, Canadian Dollars, Yen, and, beginning in January 2005, Australian Dollars. PayPal has applied for an Australian Financial Services License, and has received an official exemption from the Banking Act in Australia until October 2005. In February 2004, PayPal (Europe) Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of PayPal, received a license to operate as an Electronic Money Institution in the United Kingdom as a vehicle for providing localized versions of PayPals service to customers in the EU. Fifteen of the 44 countries outside of the U.S. whose residents can use the PayPal service are members of the European Union. As PayPal (Europe) develops localized services for the domestic market in these countries, it is implementing such localized services through an expedited passport notification process through the UK regulator to regulators in other EU member states, pursuant to EU Directives. PayPal (Europe) has filed passport notices in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Greece and Spain. The regulators in these countries could notify PayPal (Europe) of local consumer protection laws that will apply to its business, in addition to UK consumer protection law. Any such responses from these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, PayPals plans for expanding its business. PayPal (Europe) is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure, reporting, anti money laundering, capitalization, funds management or other requirements imposed on electronic money institutions. In many countries outside of the U.S. and the European Union, it is not clear whether PayPals U.S. based service is subject to local law or, if it is subject to local law, whether such local law requires a payment processor like PayPal to be licensed as a bank or financial institution or otherwise. Even if PayPal is not currently required to obtain a license in those countries, future localization or targeted marketing of PayPals service in those countries could require licensure and other laws of those countries (such as data protection laws) may apply. If PayPal were found to be subject to and in violation of any foreign laws or regulations, it could be subject to liability, forced to change its business practices or forced to suspend providing services to customers in one or more countries. Alternatively, PayPal could be required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on it and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of its product. Delay or failure to receive such a license would require PayPal to change its business practices or features in ways that would adversely affect PayPals international expansion plans and could require PayPal to suspend providing services to customers in one or more countries. We are subject to regulations relating to consumer privacy. Several domestic jurisdictions have proposed, and California, Minnesota, Utah, and Vermont have recently passed, legislation that limits the uses of personal information gathered online or offline. In addition to these four states, many other jurisdictions already have such laws and continuously consider strengthening them, especially against online services. eBay and PayPal in certain instances are subject to some of these current laws. PayPal may also be subject to recently enacted legislation in several states and countries imposing greater restrictions on the ability of financial services companies to share user information with third parties without affirmative user consent. However, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, or FACT, included a provision preempting conflicting state laws on the sharing of information between corporate affiliates, and as a result we believe that PayPal and eBay will not be subject to the laws of each individual state with respect to matters within the scope of FACT, but will remain subject to the provisions of FACT and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Courts are currently determining the scope of these preemptive provisions. Specific statutes intended to protect user privacy have been passed in many non U.S. jurisdictions, including virtually every non U.S. jurisdiction in which we currently have a localized website. Compliance with these laws, given the tight integration of our systems across different countries and the need to move data to facilitate transactions amongst our users (e.g., to payment companies, shipping companies, etc.), is both 50 Table of Contents necessary and difficult. Failure to comply could subject us to lawsuits, fines, criminal penalties, statutory damages, adverse publicity, and other losses that could harm our business. Changes to existing laws or the passage of new laws intended to address these privacy and data protection and retention issues could directly affect the way we do business or could create uncertainty on the Internet. This could reduce demand for our services, increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service or delivery costs, or otherwise harm our business. New and existing regulations could harm our business. We are subject to the same foreign and domestic laws as other companies conducting business on and off the Internet. Today, there are still relatively few laws specifically directed towards online services. However, due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and online services, many laws relating to the Internet are being debated at all levels of government around the world and it is possible that such laws and regulations will be adopted. These laws and regulations could cover issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, fraud, content and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights, and information security. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property issues, taxation, libel and defamation, obscenity, and personal privacy apply to online businesses. The vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Those laws that do reference the Internet, such as the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the European Unions Directive on Distance Selling and Electronic Commerce have begun to be interpreted by the courts and implemented by the EU Member States, but their applicability and scope remain somewhat uncertain. As our activities and the types of goods listed on our website expand, regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we or our users are either subject to licensure or prohibited from conducting our business in their jurisdiction, either with respect to our services in general, or in order to allow the sale of certain items (e.g., real estate, event tickets, cultural goods, boats, automobiles). Numerous states and foreign jurisdictions, including the State of California, where our headquarters are located, have regulations regarding auctions and the handling of property by pawnbrokers. No final legal determination has been made as to whether the California regulations apply to our business and little precedent exists in this area. Several states and some foreign jurisdictions have attempted, and may attempt in the future, to impose such regulations upon us or our users, which could harm our business. In August 2002, Illinois amended its auction law to provide for a special regulatory regime for Internet auction listing services, and we have registered as an Internet auction listing service in Illinois. Although we do not expect this registration to have a negative impact on our business, other regulatory and licensure claims could result in costly litigation or could require us to change the way we or our users do business in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues or force us to prohibit listings of certain items for some locations. We could also be subject to fines or other penalties, and any of these outcomes could harm our business. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide, and we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide, foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws. For example, the Australian high court has ruled that a U.S. website in certain circumstances must comply with Australian laws regarding libel. As we expand and localize our international activities, we become obligated to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate. Laws regulating Internet companies outside of the U.S. may be less favorable than those in the U.S., giving greater rights to consumers, content owners, and users. Compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings relative to those in the U.S. Our failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to bans on our services. PayPal has limited experience in managing and accounting accurately for large amounts of customer funds. PayPals failure to manage these funds properly would harm its business. PayPals ability to manage and account accurately for customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. PayPal has neither an established operating history nor proven management experience in maintain 51 Table of Contents ing, over a long term, these internal controls. As PayPals business continues to grow, it must strengthen its internal controls accordingly. PayPals success requires significant public confidence in its ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain necessary controls or to manage accurately customer funds could diminish customer use of PayPals product severely. Our business is subject to online commerce security risks, including security breaches and identity theft. To succeed, online commerce and communications must provide a secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Our security measures may not prevent security breaches that could harm our business. Currently, a significant number of our users authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us. PayPals users routinely provide credit card and other financial information. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information, including customer credit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect transaction data. In addition, any party who is able to illicitly obtain a users password could access the users transaction data. A number of websites have reported breaches of their security. Any compromise of our security could harm our reputation and, therefore, our business. In addition, a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information, or cause interruptions in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation and business. Our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break ins, and similar disruptions, and we have experienced denial of service type attacks on our system that have made all or portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. These issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we operate. Security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our insurance policies carry low coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. Our users, as well as those of other prominent Internet companies, have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent emails to misappropriate passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal information. These emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by eBay or PayPal, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email. We actively pursue the parties responsible for these attempts at misappropriation and encourage our users to divulge sensitive information only after they have verified that they are on our legitimate websites, but we cannot entirely eliminate these types of activities. Our failure to manage growth could harm our business. We are currently expanding our headcount, facilities, and infrastructure in the U.S. and internationally. We anticipate that further expansion will be required to address potential growth in our customer base and number of listings and payment transactions, as well as our expansion into new geographic areas, types of goods, and alternative methods of sale. This expansion has placed, and we expect it will continue to place, a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. The areas that are put under strain by our growth include the following: Our Websites. We must constantly add new hardware, update software and add new engineering personnel to accommodate the increased use of our and our subsidiaries websites and the new products and features we regularly introduce. This upgrade process is expensive, and the increased complexity of our websites increases the cost of additional enhancements. Failure to upgrade our technology, features, transaction processing systems, security infrastructure, or network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic or transaction volume could harm our business. Adverse consequences could include unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, degradation in levels of customer support, impaired quality of users experiences of our services, impaired quality of services for third party application developers using our externally accessible Application Programming Interface, or 52 Table of Contents API, and delays in reporting accurate financial information. We may be unable to effectively upgrade and expand our systems in a timely manner or smoothly integrate any newly developed or purchased technologies or businesses with our existing systems, and any failure to do so could result in problems on our sites. For example, in October 2004, we experienced unscheduled downtime on the PayPal website related to system upgrades. Despite our efforts to increase site scalability and reliability, our infrastructure could prove unable to handle a larger volume of customer transactions. Any failure to accommodate transaction growth could impair customer satisfaction, lead to a loss of customers, impair our ability to add customers, or increase our costs, all of which would harm our business. Further, steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems are expensive, reduce our margins, and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime. Customer Account Billing. Our revenues depend on prompt and accurate billing processes. We recently completed a significant project to enhance our billing software. Problems with the conversion to the new billing system during the second and third quarters of 2004 caused incorrect account balance totals to be displayed for some users. In July 2004, a complaint seeking class action status was filed alleging that eBay improperly billed its users and improperly debited some user accounts. The complaint was recently amended to include a larger variety of billing related problems and a longer time frame. While these problems have been corrected and we believe that no users were overcharged, our failure to grow our transaction processing capabilities to accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed would harm our business and our ability to collect revenue. Customer Support. We are expanding our customer support operations to accommodate the increased number of users and transactions on our websites and the increased level of trust and safety activity we provide worldwide. If we are unable to provide these operations in a cost effective manner, users of our websites may have negative experiences, current and future revenues could suffer, and our operating margins may decrease. We must continue to hire, train, and manage new employees at a rapid rate. If our new hires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to improve our transaction processing, operational and financial systems, procedures, and controls. This is a special challenge as we acquire new operations with different systems. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. The additional headcount and capital investments we are adding increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by expense reductions in the short term. Our business is adversely affected by anything that causes our users to spend less time on their computers, including seasonal factors and national events. Anything that diverts our users from their customary level of usage of our websites could adversely affect our business. We would therefore be adversely affected by geopolitical events such as war, the threat of war, or terrorist activity, and natural disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes. Similarly, our results of operations historically have been seasonal because many of our users reduce their activities on our websites with the onset of good weather during the summer months, and on and around national holidays. We have historically experienced our strongest quarters of online growth in our first and fourth fiscal quarters. PayPal has shown similar seasonality, especially in the fourth fiscal quarter. We expect these patterns of seasonality to become more pronounced as our websites gain acceptance by a broader base of mainstream users and as the size of our European operations, which experience greater seasonality, grows relative to our other operations. Use of our services for illegal purposes could harm our business. The law relating to the liability of providers of online services for the activities of their users on their service is currently unsettled in the United States and internationally. We are aware that certain goods, such as weapons, adult material, tobacco products, alcohol, and other goods that may be subject to regulation, have 53 Table of Contents been listed and traded on our service. We may be unable to prevent our users from selling unlawful goods or selling goods in an unlawful manner, and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through our service. We have been subject to several lawsuits based upon such allegations. In December 2004, an executive of Baazee.com, our Indian subsidiary, was arrested in connection with the listing of a pornographic video clip on that site. Similarly, our Korean subsidiary and one of its employees was found criminally liable for a listing on the Korean subsidiarys website. In order to reduce our exposure to this liability, we have prohibited the listing of certain items and increased the number of personnel reviewing questionable items. In the future, we may implement other protective measures that could require us to spend substantial resources or discontinue certain service offerings. Any costs incurred as a result of potential liability relating to the sale of unlawful goods or the unlawful sale of goods could harm our business. In addition, we have received significant and continuing media attention relating to the listing or sale of unlawful goods using our services. This negative publicity could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand names. It also could make users reluctant to continue to use our services. PayPals payment system is also susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses. These may include illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software and other intellectual property, money laundering, bank fraud, child pornography trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, and online securities fraud. PayPal recently announced a change in its acceptable use policy that would enable PayPal to fine users in certain jurisdictions up to $500 or take legal action to recover its losses for certain violations of that policy, including online gambling and illegal sales of prescription medications. Despite measures PayPal has taken to detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct, illegal activities may be funded using PayPal. PayPal is subject to money laundering laws and regulations that prohibit, among other things, its involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. Although PayPal has adopted a program to comply with these laws and regulations, any errors or failure to implement the program properly could lead to lawsuits, administrative action, and prosecution by the government. In July 2003, PayPal agreed with the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri that it would pay $10 million as a civil forfeiture to settle allegations that its provision of services to online gambling merchants violated provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and further agreed to have its compliance program reviewed by an independent audit firm. PayPal is also subject to regulations that require it to report suspicious activities involving transactions of $2,000 or more and may be required to obtain and keep more detailed records on the senders and recipients in certain transfers of $3,000 or more. The interpretation of suspicious activities in this context is uncertain. Future regulations under the USA PATRIOT Act may require PayPal to revise the procedures it uses to verify the identity of its customers and to monitor more closely international transactions. These regulations could impose significant costs on PayPal and make it more difficult for new customers to join its network. PayPal could be required to learn more about its customers before opening an account, to obtain additional verification of international customers and to monitor its customers activities more closely. These requirements, as well as any additional restrictions imposed by Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover, could raise PayPals costs significantly and reduce the attractiveness of its product. Failure to comply with federal and state money laundering laws could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, and forfeiture of significant assets. We are subject to intellectual property and other litigation. In April 2001, two of our European subsidiaries, eBay GmbH and eBay International AG, were sued by Montres Rolex S.A. and certain of its affiliates in the regional court of Cologne, Germany. The suit subsequently was transferred to the regional court in Dsseldorf, Germany. Rolex alleged that our subsidiaries were infringing Rolexs trademarks as a result of users selling counterfeit Rolex watches through our German website. The suit also alleged unfair competition. Rolex sought an order enjoining the sale of Rolex branded watches on the website as well as damages. In December 2002, a trial was held in the matter and the court ruled in favor of eBay on all causes of action. Rolex appealed the ruling to the Higher Regional Court of Dsseldorf, and the appeal was heard in October 2003. In February 2004, the court rejected Rolexs appeal and ruled in our favor. Rolex has appealed the ruling to the German Federal Supreme Court. In March 2004, 54 Table of Contents the German Federal Supreme Court ruled in favor of Rolex in a case involving an unrelated company, ricardo.de AG, but somewhat comparable legal theories. The court issued its written decision in that case in September 2004. Although it is not yet clear what effect the reasoning of the German Federal Supreme Courts ricardo.de decision would have when applied to eBay, we believe the Courts decision will likely not require any significant change in our business practices. In September 2001, a complaint was filed by MercExchange LLC against us, our Half.com subsidiary and ReturnBuy, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (No. 2:01 CV 736) alleging infringement of three patents (relating to online auction technology, multiple database searching and electronic consignment systems) and seeking a permanent injunction and damages (including treble damages for willful infringement). In October 2002, the court granted in part our summary judgment motion, effectively invalidating the patent related to online auction technology and rendering it unenforceable. This ruling left only two patents in the case. Trial of the matter began in April 2003. In May 2003, the jury returned a verdict finding that eBay had willfully infringed one and Half.com had willfully infringed both of the patents in the suit, awarding $35 million in compensatory damages. Both parties filed post trial motions, and in August 2003, the court entered judgment for MercExchange in the amount of $29.5 million, plus pre judgment interest and post judgment interest in an amount to be determined, while denying MercExchanges request for an injunction and attorneys fees. We appealed the verdict and judgment in favor of MercExchange, and MercExchange filed a cross appeal of the granting in part of our summary judgment motion and the denial of its request for an injunction and attorneys fees. Oral arguments for the appeals were heard on October 5, 2004. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office recently granted our request that it reexamine the three patents at suit, and on January 26, 2005, the Patent and Trademark Office issued a ruling rejecting all of MercExchanges claims under the patent that related to online auctions. We continue to believe that the verdict against us in the trial was incorrect and intend to continue to pursue our appeal and defend ourselves vigorously. However, even if successful, our appeal of and defense against this action will continue to be costly. In addition, as a precautionary measure, we have modified certain functionality of our websites and business practices in a manner which we believe makes them not infringe the two patents that we were found to have infringed. Nonetheless, if we are not successful in appealing the courts ruling, we might be forced to pay significant additional damages and licensing fees or modify our business practices in an adverse manner. In August 2002, Charles E. Hill & Associates, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (No. 2:02 CV 186) alleging that we and 17 other companies, primarily large retailers, infringed three patents owned by Hill generally relating to electronic catalog systems and methods for transmitting and updating data at a remote computer. The suit seeks an injunction against continuing infringement, unspecified damages, including treble damages for willful infringement, and interest, costs, expenses, and fees. In January 2003, the case was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. After pending in Indiana for almost a year, the case was transferred back to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in December 2003. A scheduling conference was held in November 2004, and a preliminary trial date has been set for February 2006. The case is currently in fact discovery and claim construction discovery. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. In February 2002, PayPal was sued in California state court (No. CV 805433) in a purported class action alleging that its restriction of customer accounts and failure to promptly unrestrict legitimate accounts violates California state consumer protection laws and is an unfair business practice and a breach of PayPals User Agreement. This action was re filed with a different named plaintiff in June 2002 (No. CV 808441), and a similar action was also filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June 2002 (No. C 02 2777). In March 2002, PayPal was sued in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (No. C 02 1227) in a purported class action alleging that its restrictions of customer accounts and failure to promptly unrestrict legitimate accounts violates federal and state consumer protection and unfair business practice laws. The two federal court actions were consolidated into a single case, and the state court action was stayed pending developments in the federal case. In June 2004, the parties announced that they had reached a proposed settlement. The settlement received approval from the federal court on November 2, 2004, but the courts approval could be appealed. In the settlement, PayPal does not acknowledge that any of the 55 Table of Contents allegations in the case are true. Under the terms of the settlement, certain PayPal account holders will be eligible to receive payment from a settlement fund of $9.25 million, less administrative costs and the amount awarded to plaintiffs counsel by the court. That sum will be distributed to class members who have submitted timely claims in accordance with the settlements plan of allocation, which still must be approved by the court. The parties expect that a plan of allocation will be submitted to the court in the first quarter of 2005. The amount of the settlement was fully accrued in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2003. In July 2004, a purported class action lawsuit was filed by two eBay users in Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara (No. 104CV022708) alleging that eBay engaged in improper billing practices as the result of problems with the rollout of a new billing software system in the second and third quarters of 2004. The lawsuit sought damages and injunctive relief. An amended complaint was filed in January 2005, dropping one plaintiff, changing the capacity of the other plaintiff to that of representative plaintiff, and adding seven additional eBay users as plaintiffs. The amended complaint expanded its claim to include numerous alleged improper billing practices from September 2003 until the present. In February 2005, eBay filed a motion to strike and a demurrer seeking to dismiss the complaint. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. In February 2005, eBay was sued in Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara (No. 105CV035930) in a purported class action alleging that certain bidding features of our site constitute shill bidding for the purpose of artificially inflating bids placed by buyers on the site. The complaint alleges violations of Californias Auction Act, Californias Consumer Remedies Act, and unfair competition. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, damages, and a constructive trust. The plaintiffs have not yet served eBay with the complaint. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. Other third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We have been notified of several potential patent disputes, and expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims as our services expand in scope and complexity. In particular, we expect to face additional patent infringement claims involving services we provide, including various aspects of our Payments business. We have in the past been forced to litigate such claims. We may also become more vulnerable to third party claims as laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less favorable. These claims, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming and costly to resolve, cause service upgrade delays, require expensive changes in our methods of doing business, or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements. From time to time, we are involved in other disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business. The number and significance of these disputes is increasing as our business expands and our company grows larger. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. Government inquiries may lead to charges or penalties. In January 1999, we received initial requests to produce certain records and information to the federal government relating to an investigation of possible illegal transactions in connection with our websites. We were informed that the inquiry includes an examination of our practices with respect to these transactions. In order to protect the investigation, the court has ordered that no further public disclosures be made with respect to the matter. Any civil or criminal charges against us would likely harm our business due to negative publicity, the cost of litigation, the diversion of management time, and any fines or penalties assessed. A large number of transactions occur on our websites. We believe that government regulators have received a substantial number of consumer complaints about both eBay and PayPal, which, while small as a percentage of our total transactions, are large in aggregate numbers. As a result, we have from time to time been contacted by various foreign and domestic governmental regulatory agencies that have questions about our operations and the steps we take to protect our users from fraud. PayPal has received inquiries regarding 56 Table of Contents its restriction and disclosure practices from the Federal Trade Commission and the attorneys general of a number of states. If PayPals processes are found to violate federal or state law on consumer protection and unfair business practices, it could be subject to an enforcement action or fines. If PayPal becomes subject to an enforcement action, it could be required to restructure its anti fraud processes in ways that would harm its business, and to pay substantial fines. Even if PayPal is able to defend itself successfully, an enforcement action could cause damage to its reputation, could consume substantial amounts of its managements time and attention, and could require PayPal to change its customer service and operations in ways that could increase its costs and decrease the effectiveness of its anti fraud program. Both eBay and PayPal are likely to receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future, which may lead to action against either company. We have responded to all inquiries from regulatory agencies by describing our current and planned antifraud efforts, customer support procedures and operating procedures. If one or more of these agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future inquiries, we could be subject to fines or other penalties, or forced to change our operating practices in ways that could harm our business. We are subject to laws relating to the use and transfer of personally identifiable information about our users, especially users located outside of the U.S. Violation of these laws, which in many cases apply not only to third party transactions but also to transfers of information between ourselves and our subsidiaries, and between ourselves, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relations, could subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and could adversely affect us. The listing or sale by our users of pirated or counterfeit items may harm our business. We have received in the past, and we anticipate receiving in the future, communications alleging that certain items listed or sold through our service by our users infringe third party copyrights, trademarks and trade names, or other intellectual property rights. Although we have sought to work actively with the owners of intellectual property rights to eliminate listings offering infringing items on our websites, some rights owners have expressed the view that our efforts are insufficient. Content owners and other intellectual property rights owners have been active in defending their rights against online companies, including eBay. Allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights have resulted in litigation against us from time to time, including litigation brought by Tiffany & Co. in the U.S., Rolex S.A. in Germany, and a number of other owners of intellectual property rights. While we have been largely successful to date in defending against such litigation, more recent cases have been based, at least in part, on different legal theories than those of earlier cases, and there is no guarantee that we will continue to be successful in our defense. In addition, we expect that this type of litigation may increase as our sites gain prominence in markets outside of the U.S., where the laws may be unsettled or less favorable to us. Such litigation is costly for us, could result in damage awards or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, could require us to change our business practices in expensive ways, or could otherwise harm our business. Litigation against other online companies could result in interpretations of the law that could also require us to change our business practices or otherwise increase our costs. We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our service. The law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services is currently unsettled. Claims could be made against online services companies under both U.S. and foreign law for defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services. Several private lawsuits seeking to impose liability upon us under a number of these theories have been brought against us. In addition, domestic and foreign legislation has been proposed that would prohibit or impose liability for the transmission over the Internet of certain types of information. Our service features a Feedback Forum, which includes information from users regarding other users. Although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us, claims of defamation or other injury have been made in the past and could be made in the future against us for content posted in the Feedback Forum. Several recent court decisions have narrowed the scope of the immunity provided to Internet service providers like us under the Communications Decency Act. This trend, if continued, may increase our potential liability to third parties for 57 Table of Contents the user provided content on our site. Our liability for such claims may be higher in jurisdictions outside the U.S. where laws governing Internet transactions are unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain service offerings, which would negatively affect our financial results. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business. Customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer service could diminish use of our services. Customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer service could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our services. Breaches of our customers privacy and our security measures could have the same effect. Measures we sometimes take to combat risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security can damage relations with our customers. These measures heighten the need for prompt and accurate customer service to resolve irregularities and disputes. Effective customer service requires significant personnel expense, and this expense, if not managed properly, could impact our profitability significantly. Failure to manage or train our customer service representatives properly could compromise our ability to handle customer complaints effectively. If we do not handle customer complaints effectively, our reputation may suffer and we may lose our customers confidence. Because it is providing a financial service and operating in a more regulated environment, PayPal, unlike eBay, must provide telephone as well as email customer service and must resolve certain customer contacts within shorter time frames. As part of PayPals program to reduce fraud losses, it may temporarily restrict the ability of customers to withdraw their funds if those funds or the customers account activity are identified by PayPals anti fraud models as suspicious. PayPal has in the past received negative publicity with respect to its customer service and account restrictions, and is the subject of purported class action lawsuits and state attorney general inquiries alleging, among other things, failure to resolve account restrictions promptly. If PayPal is unable to provide quality customer support operations in a cost effective manner, PayPals users may have negative experiences, PayPal may receive additional negative publicity and its ability to attract new customers may be damaged. Current and future revenues could suffer, or its operating margins may decrease. In addition, negative publicity about or experiences with PayPals customer support could cause eBays reputation to suffer or affect consumer confidence in eBay as a whole. Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences. We have acquired a number of businesses in the past, and have recently completed or announced the acquisitions of Marktplaats.nl, a classified listing site in the Netherlands, and Rent.com, an Internet classified site focused on the apartment and rental housing industry. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets, including interests in our existing subsidiaries and joint ventures. At any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of such transactions. Any of such transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There is no assurance that any such discussions or negotiations will result in the consummation of any transaction. The process of integrating any acquired business may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky. The areas where we may face difficulties include: diversion of management time, as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues of integration and future products; declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in compensation, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the business; the need to integrate each companys accounting, management information, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented; 58 Table of Contents the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls, procedures and policies; and in some cases, the need to transition operations onto the existing eBay platform. Foreign acquisitions involve special risks, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks, and the particular economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions. As a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business. Our stock price has been and may continue to be extremely volatile. The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be extremely volatile and could fluctuate in response to a variety of factors, including the following: actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results and expected future results; changes in, or failure to meet, financial estimates by securities analysts; unscheduled system downtime; additions or departures of key personnel; announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors; initiation of or developments in litigation affecting us; conditions or trends in the Internet and online commerce industries; changes in the market valuations of other Internet, online commerce, or technology companies; developments in regulation; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, new products or capital commitments; unanticipated economic or political events; sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market; and other events or factors, including those described in this Risk Factors That May Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition section and others that may be beyond our control. The trading prices of Internet stocks in general, and ours in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent periods. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Even considering recent changes, the valuation of our stock remains high based on conventional valuation standards such as price to earnings and price to sales ratios. The trading price of our common stock has decreased sharply from its level in the fourth quarter in 2004, but remains much higher than our stock price during 2002 and early 2003. This trading price and valuation may not be sustained. Negative changes in the publics perception of the prospects of Internet or e commerce or technology companies have in the past and may in the future depress our stock price regardless of our results. Other broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions, such as recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations, also may decrease the market price of our common stock. Securities class action litigation is often instituted following declines in the market price of a companys securities. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources. 59 Table of Contents Problems with third parties who provide services to our users could harm our business. A number of parties provide services to our users that indirectly benefit us. Such services include seller tools that automate and manage listings, merchant tools that manage listings and interface with inventory management software, storefronts that help our users list items, and other services. In some cases we have contractual agreements with these companies that give us a direct financial interest in their success, while in other cases we have none. In either circumstance, financial, regulatory, or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to our users could reduce the number of listings on our websites or make completing transactions on our websites more difficult, and thereby harm our business. Any security breach at one of these companies could also affect our customers and harm our business. Although we generally have been able to renew or extend the terms of contractual arrangements with these third party service providers on acceptable terms, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future. Other companies or governmental agencies may view our behavior as anti competitive. Other companies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the U.S. or other countries, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. Such claims typically are very expensive to defend, involve negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and could result in significant judgments against us. We provided information to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with an inquiry into our conduct with respect to auction aggregators, including our licensing program and a previously settled lawsuit against Bidders Edge. Although the Antitrust Division has closed this inquiry, any future antitrust investigation would likely harm our business due to negative publicity, the costs of the investigation, possible private antitrust lawsuits, the diversion of management time and effort, and penalties we might suffer if we ultimately were not to prevail. We depend on key personnel. Our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel and our ability to retain and motivate them. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business. We do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel, we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies, and our Chief Executive Officer has fully vested the vast majority of her equity incentives. Our new businesses all depend on attracting and retaining key personnel. Our future success also will depend on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing, and customer support personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. In making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment. Fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees whose stock option strike prices are substantially above current market prices. Similarly, decreases in the number of unvested stock options held by existing employees, either because their options have vested or because the size of follow on option grants has declined, may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees. Our industry is intensely competitive. We currently or potentially compete with a number of companies providing both particular categories of goods and broader ranges of goods. The Internet provides new, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of goods. We expect competition to intensify in the future. The barriers to entry into these channels are relatively low, and current offline and new competitors can easily launch online sites at a nominal cost using commercially available software or partnering with any one of a number of successful e commerce companies. Our broad based competitors include the vast majority of traditional department, warehouse, discount, and general merchandise stores, emerging online retailers, online classified services, and other shopping 60 Table of Contents channels such as offline and online home shopping networks. These include most prominently: Wal Mart, Kmart, Target, Sears, Macys, JC Penney, Costco, Office Depot, Staples, OfficeMax, Sams Club, Amazon.com, Buy.com, AOL.com, Yahoo! Shopping, MSN, QVC, and Home Shopping Network. A number of companies have launched a variety of services that provide new channels for buyers to find and buy items from sellers of all sizes. For example, sites such as Buy.com, DealTime, Googles Froogle, In Store.com, MySimon.com, Nextag.com, Pricegrabber.com, Shopping.com, and Yahoo! Product Search offer shopping search engines that allow consumers to search the Internet for specified products. Similarly, sellers are increasingly acquiring new customers by paying for search related advertisements on search engine sites such as Google and Yahoo!. We use product search engines and paid search advertising to channel users to our sites, but these services also have the potential to divert users to other online shopping destinations. We also face competition from local, regional, and national specialty retailers and exchanges in each of our categories of products. Many competitors have been successful at establishing marketplaces that cater to a particular retail category, such as vehicles, tickets, or sporting goods. Examples of category specific competitors include: Books/ Movies/ Music: Abebooks.com, Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble, Alibris.com, Blockbuster, BMG, Columbia House, Best Buy, CDNow, Express.com, Emusic.com, and Tower Records; Business & Industrial: Ariba, BidFreight.com, Bid4Assets, BizBuyer.com, bLiquid.com, Buyer Zone, CloseOutNow.com, Commerce One, Concur Technologies, DoveBid, FreeMarkets, Iron Planet, labx.com, Oracle, PurchasePro.com, RicardoBiz.com, Sabre, SurplusBin.com, Ventro, and VerticalNet; Clothing & Accessories: Abercrombie & Fitch, AE.com, Bloomingdales, Bluefly.com, Coldwater Creek.com, Delias.com, Dockers.com, Eddie Bauer, The Gap, J.

Our international websites compete with similar online and offline channels in each of their vertical categories in most countries. In addition, they compete with general online e commerce sites, such as Quelle and Otto in Germany, Yahoo Kimo in Taiwan, Daum in South Korea, TaoBao and 1pai, a partnership between Sina.com and Yahoo! in China, and Amazon in the U.K. and other countries. In some of these countries, there are online sites that have much larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we do, and in certain of these jurisdictions there are competitors that may have a better understanding of local culture and commerce than we do. The principal competitive factors for eBay include the following: ability to attract buyers and sellers; volume of transactions and price and selection of goods; customer service; and brand recognition. With respect to our online competition, additional competitive factors include: community cohesion, interaction and size; system reliability; reliability of delivery and payment; website convenience and accessibility; level of service fees; and quality of search tools. Some current and potential competitors have longer company operating histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recognition in other business and Internet sectors than we do. Some of these competitors also have significantly greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources. Other online trading services may be acquired by, receive investments from, or enter into other commercial relationships with larger, well established and well financed companies. As a result, some of our competitors with other revenue sources may be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than we can. Some of our competitors have offered services for free and others may do this as well. We may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors. In addition, certain offline competitors may encourage manufacturers to limit or cease distribution of their products to dealers who sell through online channels such as eBay, or may attempt to use existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit online commerce in certain categories of goods or services. The adoption by manufacturers or government authorities of policies or regulations discouraging the sales of goods or services over the Internet could force eBay users to stop selling certain products on our websites. Increased competition or anti Internet distribution policies or regulations may result in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and diminished value of our brand. In order to respond to changes in the competitive environment, we may, from time to time, make pricing, service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could harm our profitability. For example, we have implemented a buyer protection program that generally insures items up to a value of $200, with a $25 deductible, for users with a non negative feedback rating at no cost to the user. PayPal has implemented a similar buyer protection program covering losses from selected eBay sellers up to $1,000, with no deductible. Depending on the amount and size of claims we receive under these programs, these product offerings could harm our profitability. In addition, certain competitors may offer or continue to offer free shipping or other 62 Table of Contents transaction related services, which could be impractical or inefficient for eBay users to match. New technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling our competitors to offer a lower cost service. Although we have established Internet traffic arrangements with several large online services and search engine companies, these arrangements may not be renewed on commercially reasonable terms or these companies may decide to promote competitive services. Even if these arrangements are renewed, they may not result in increased usage of our services. In addition, companies that control user access to transactions through network access, Internet browsers, or search engines, could promote our competitors, channel current or potential users to their vertically integrated electronic commerce sites or their advertisers sites, attempt to restrict our access, or charge us substantial fees for inclusion. The market for PayPals product is emerging, intensely competitive, and characterized by rapid technological change. PayPal competes with existing online and off line payment methods, including, among others: credit card merchant processors that offer their services to online merchants, including Card Services International, Chase, First Data, iPayment, Paymentech, and Wells Fargo; and payment gateways, including CyberSource, VeriSign, and Authorize.net; BidPay.com and Western Union MoneyZap, each operated by subsidiaries of First Data; payment services offered by Amazon.com; CheckFree; processors that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account, including Certegy and TeleCheck, a subsidiary of First Data, or to pay on credit, including Bill Me Later from I4 Commerce and CIT Bank; providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit cards, checks, money orders, and Automated Clearing House transactions; and issuers of stored value targeted at online payments, including VisaBuxx. Some of these competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, customer service and other resources, greater name recognition, or a larger base of customers in affiliated businesses than PayPal. PayPals competitors may respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements faster and more effectively than PayPal. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services than PayPal, and they may offer lower prices. Some of these competitors have offered, and may continue to offer, their services for free in order to gain market share, and PayPal may be forced to lower its prices in response. Competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may offer greater liquidity and engender greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services than PayPal. If these competitors acquired significant market share, this could result in PayPal losing market share. Overseas, PayPal faces competition from similar channels and payment methods in most countries and from regional and national online and offline competitors in each country including Visas Visa Direct, MasterCards MoneySend, INGs Way2Pay and Royal Bank of Scotlands World Pay in the European Community, NOCHEX, Moneybookers, and Royal Bank of Scotlands FastPay in the U.K., CertaPay and HyperWallet in Canada, Paymate in Australia, Alipay in China and Inicis in South Korea. In addition, in certain countries, such as Germany and Australia, electronic funds transfer is a leading method of payment for both online and offline transactions. As in the U.S., established banks and other financial institutions that do not currently offer online payments could quickly and easily develop such a service. Our business depends on the development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure. The success of our service will depend largely on the development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security, as well as timely development of complementary products, for providing reliable 63 Table of Contents Internet access and services. The Internet has experienced, and is likely to continue to experience, significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic. The Internet infrastructure may be unable to support such demands. In addition, increasing numbers of users, increasing bandwidth requirements, or problems caused by viruses, worms, and similar programs may harm the performance of the Internet. The backbone computers of the Internet have been the targets of such programs. The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage as well as the level of traffic and the processing transactions on our service. We need to develop new services, features, and functions in order to expand. We plan to expand our operations by developing new or complementary services, products, or transaction formats and expanding the breadth and depth of our pre trade and post trade services. We may be unable to expand our operations in a cost effective or timely manner. We are pursuing strategic relationships with other companies to provide many of these services. As a result, we may be unable to control the quality of these services or adequately address problems that arise. Expanding our operations in this manner also will require significant additional expenses and development, operations and other resources and will strain our management, financial and operational resources. The lack of acceptance of any new businesses or services could harm our business, damage our reputation, and diminish the value of our brand. We may be unable to protect or enforce our own intellectual property rights adequately. We regard the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets as critical to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress and trade secret laws, and through the domain name dispute resolution system. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services. We have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. These contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter independent development of similar technologies by others. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. Effective trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress, trade secret, and domain name protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our trademarks, patents, and domain names in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful in every location. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. We are subject to the risks of owning real property. We own real property including land and buildings related to our operations. We have little experience in managing real property. Ownership of this property subjects us to risks, including: the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems; adverse changes in the value of these properties, due to interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhoods in which the properties are located, or other factors; the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning, seismic, disability act, or other requirements; and possible disputes with tenants, neighboring owners, or others. 64 Table of Contents Some anti takeover provisions may affect the price of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences, rights and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock may be harmed by rights granted to the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. Some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These include provisions that provide for a classified board of directors, prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings. We are also subject to provisions of Delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are met. This restriction could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control. ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities, including government and corporate securities and money market funds. These securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of estimated tax. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk. The fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. In general, securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed rate securities, floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease. Due in part to these factors, our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2004, our fixed income investments earned a pretax yield of approximately 1.7%, with a weighted average maturity of six months. If interest rates were to instantaneously increase (decrease) by 100 basis points, the fair market value of the total investment portfolio could decrease (increase) by approximately $16.8 million. We entered into two interest rate swaps on June 19 and July 20, 2000, with notional amounts totaling $95 million to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on a portion of the floating rate operating lease for our San Jose headquarters office facilities. The interest rate swaps allow us to receive floating rate receipts based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, in exchange for making fixed rate payments which effectively changes our interest rate exposure on our operating lease from a floating rate to a fixed rate on $95 million of the total $126.4 million notional amount of our San Jose headquarters facility lease commitment. The balance of $31.4 million remains at a floating rate of interest based on the spread over 3 month LIBOR. If the 3 month LIBOR rates were to increase (decrease) by 100 basis points, then our payments would increase (decrease) by $78,000 per quarter. The fair value of the interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2004 was an unrealized loss of approximately $662,000, net of tax benefit, and is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet. The interest rate swap will mature in March 2005, at which time the lease will expire and we will purchase our San Jose headquarters facility. Equity Price Risk We are exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of equity investments we hold, typically as the result of strategic investments in third parties that are subject to considerable market risk due to their volatility. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure in these equity investments. In accordance with our policy to assess whether an impairment loss on our investments has occurred due to declines in fair value and other market conditions, we determined that declines in fair value of certain of our 65 Table of Contents marketable and non marketable equity investments were other than temporary. Accordingly, we recorded impairment charges totaling $3.8 million and $1.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively, relating to the other than temporary impairment in the fair value of certain equity investments. We did not record an impairment charge related to the other than temporary impairment in the fair value of equity investments during the year ended December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, the total carrying value of our equity instruments and equity method investment was $48.3 million, including $1.1 million in marketable investments. At December 31, 2003, the total carrying value of our equity investments was $14.3 million, including $1.1 million in marketable investments. Foreign Currency Risk International net revenues result from transactions by our foreign operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country. These operations also incur most of their expenses in the local currency. Accordingly, our foreign operations use the local currency, which is primarily the Euro, and to a lesser extent, the British Pound, as their functional currency. Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors. In addition, at December 31, 2004, we held balances in cash, cash equivalents and investments outside the U.S. totaling approximately $467 million. Transaction Exposure: As of December 31, 2004, we had outstanding forward foreign exchange hedge contracts with notional values equivalent to approximately $316 million with maturity dates within 11 days. The hedge contracts are used to offset changes in the functional currency value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as a result of currency fluctuations. Transaction gains and losses on the contracts and the assets and liabilities are recognized each period in our consolidated statement of income. Translation Exposure: Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as well as our consolidated results of operations. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet. The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position for the year ended December 31, 2004, was a net translation gain of approximately $140 million. This gain is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of income. We consolidate the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries by converting them into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation (FAS 52). Such earnings will fluctuate when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates. From time to time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency denominated earnings translation exposure using both foreign currency options and forward contracts. The aggregate notional amount of these hedges entered into in 2004 was 109 million Euro and 43 million British pounds. The loss on these hedges for 2004 totaled approximately $2.0 million, which were recorded in interest and other income, net. All contracts that hedge translation exposure mature ratably over the quarter in which they are executed. Economic Exposure: We currently charge our foreign subsidiaries on a monthly basis for their use of eBays intellectual property and technology and for corporate services provided by eBay Inc. such as insurance, tax and legal. This charge is denominated in Euros and these forecasted inter company transaction at eBay Inc. represent a 66 Table of Contents foreign currency cash flow exposure. To reduce foreign exchange risk relating to these forecasted inter company transactions, we entered into forward foreign exchange contacts during the year ended December 31, 2004. The objective of the forward contracts is to ensure that the U.S. dollar equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the U.S. dollar/ Euro exchange rate. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133), we expect the hedge of these forecasted transactions to be highly effective in offsetting potential changes in cash flows attributed to a change in the U.S. dollar/ Euro exchange rate. Accordingly, we record as a component of other comprehensive income all unrealized gains and losses related to the forward contracts that receive hedge accounting treatment. We record all unrealized gains and losses in interest and other income, net, related to the forward contracts that do not receive hedge accounting treatment pursuant to FAS 133. There were no outstanding forward contracts that receive hedge accounting treatment at December 31, 2004. The following table shows the notional amount of our economic hedges entered into in 2004, together with the associated losses, net of gains, recorded in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2004, and the amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2004: Accumulated Net Loss Recorded Other Notional to Interest and Comprehensive Amount Other Income, Net Income (In thousands) Amount receiving hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133 $ 140,196 $ (3,357 ) $ Amount not receiving hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133 30,772 (333 ) Total $ 170,968 $ (3,690 ) $ No economic hedges were entered into during the year ended December 31, 2003.
