Overview About eBay Inc. Our purpose is to pioneer new communities around the world built on commerce, sustained by trust, and inspired by opportunity. We bring together millions of buyers and sellers every day on a local, national and international basis through an array of websites. We provide online marketplaces for the sale of goods and services, online payments services and online communication offerings to a diverse community of individuals and businesses. We currently have three primary businesses: the eBay Marketplaces, Payments and Communications. Our eBay Marketplaces provide the infrastructure to enable online commerce in a variety of formats, including the traditional auction platform, along with our other online platforms, such as Rent.com, Shopping.com, Kijiji, mobile.de, and Marktplaats.nl. Our Payments business, which consists of our PayPal business, enables individuals or businesses to securely, easily and quickly send and receive payments online. Our Communications business, which consists of our Skype business, enables VoIP calls between Skype users, as well as provides low cost connectivity to traditional fixed line and mobile telephones. 48 Table of Contents Executive Operating and Financial Summary Our focus is on understanding our key operating and financial metrics Members of our senior management team regularly review key operating metrics such as new users, new user accounts, active users, listings and gross merchandise volume, as well as total payment volume processed by our wholly owned PayPal subsidiary and number of users registered with our Skype subsidiary. Members of our senior management also regularly review key financial information including net revenues, operating income margins, earnings per share, cash flows from operations and free cash flows, which we define as operating cash flows less purchases of property and equipment, net. These operating and financial measures allow us to monitor the health and vibrancy of our Marketplaces, Payments, and Communications platforms and the profitability of our business and to evaluate the effectiveness of investments that we have made and continue to make in the areas of international expansion, customer support, product development, marketing and site operations. We believe that an understanding of these key operating and financial measures and how they change over time is important to investors, analysts and other parties analyzing our business results and future market opportunities. Our expectations for growth We expect that our growth in net revenues during 2006 will result primarily from increased net transaction revenues across our U.S. Marketplaces, International Marketplaces, Payments and Communications segments. We continue to make investments in our business and infrastructure to help us achieve our long term growth objectives. We expect to continue our investments in the areas of international expansion for our eBay Marketplaces, our Payments and Communications businesses, customer support, site operations, marketing and various corporate infrastructure areas. We believe these investments are necessary to support the long term demands of our growing business as well as to build the infrastructure necessary to support long term growth. In addition, to the extent that the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, and, in particular, the Euro, British pound and Korean won, the remeasurement of these foreign currency denominated transactions into U.S. dollars will negatively impact our consolidated net revenues and, to the extent that they are not hedged, our net income. The discussion of our consolidated financial results contained herein is intended to assist investors, analysts and other parties reading this report to better understand the key operating and financial measures summarized above as well as the changes in our consolidated results of operations from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. Seasonality The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, our total net revenues and the sequential quarterly growth of these net revenues. March 31 June 30 September 30 December 31 (In thousands, except percentages) 2003 Net revenues $ 476,492 $ 509,269 $ 530,942 $ 648,393 Current quarter vs prior quarter 15 % 7 % 4 % 22 % 2004 Net revenues $ 756,239 $ 773,412 $ 805,876 $ 935,782 Current quarter vs prior quarter 17 % 2 % 4 % 16 % 2005 Net revenues $ 1,031,724 $ 1,086,303 $ 1,105,515 $ 1,328,859 Current quarter vs prior quarter 10 % 5 % 2 % 20 % We have historically experienced our strongest quarters of sequential growth in the first and fourth fiscal quarters. We expect transaction activity patterns on our websites to increasingly mirror general consumer 49 Table of Contents buying patterns, both online and offline as our business matures. Our expectation is that Skypes business will experience seasonally slower growth during holiday periods. Business Combinations Through both domestic and international acquisitions, we have continued to expand our global online platforms. The financial results of entities acquired in purchase transactions are reflected in our consolidated results from the dates that each acquisition closed. The aggregate purchase price for completed acquisitions, paid in the form of cash and our common stock, totaled $4.2 billion in 2005 (not including any possible future earn out payments associated with our acquisition of Skype), $1.0 billion in 2004 and $246 million in 2003. The purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date. See Note 1 The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, certain data from our consolidated statement of income as a percentage of net revenues. This information should be read in conjunction with Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates as well as our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Year Ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 Net revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of net revenues 19.2 18.8 18.0 Gross profit 80.8 81.2 82.0 Operating expenses: Sales and marketing 26.2 26.2 27.0 Product development 7.4 7.4 7.2 General and administrative 15.4 12.7 13.0 Payroll tax on employee stock options 0.4 0.5 0.3 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 2.3 2.0 2.8 Total operating expenses 51.7 48.8 50.4 Income from operations 29.1 32.4 31.7 Interest and other income, net 1.6 2.4 2.4 Interest expense (0.2 ) (0.3 ) (0.1 ) Income before cumulative effect of accounting change, income taxes and minority interests 30.6 34.5 34.0 Provision for income taxes (9.5 ) (10.5 ) (10.3 ) Minority interests (0.4 ) (0.2 ) (0.0 ) Income before cumulative effect of accounting change 20.7 23.8 23.8 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax (0.3 ) Net income 20.4 % 23.8 % 23.8 % Our net revenues are derived primarily from listing, feature and final value fees paid by sellers on our eBay Marketplaces and fees from payment processing services on our PayPal platform. Our net revenues have continued to grow each year, primarily as a result of increased auction and fixed price transaction activity, reflected in the growth in the number of our confirmed registered users, user activity, listings, user gross merchandise volume on our eBay Marketplaces platforms and payment transactions processed by PayPal. We believe these increases are largely the result of our promotional efforts and our emphasis on enhancing the 50 Table of Contents online commerce experience of our user community, both domestically and internationally, through the introduction of new site features and functionality and expanded trust and safety programs.

The U.S. Marketplaces segment includes our U.S. marketplaces commerce platforms, other than our PayPal subsidiary.

The Payments segment consists of our global payments platform operated by our PayPal subsidiary. The Communications segment consists of our VoIP offerings from our Skype subsidiary subsequent to our acquisition of Skype on October 14, 2005. Our net revenues result from fees associated with our transaction, referral fees, advertising and other services in our U.S. Marketplaces, International Marketplaces, Payments, and Communications segments. Net transaction revenues are derived primarily from listing, feature and final value fees paid by sellers and fees from payment processing services. Net revenues from advertising are derived principally from the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements for cash and through barter arrangements. Other non transaction net revenues are derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide transaction services to eBay and PayPal users. 52 Table of Contents The successive year over year growth in net revenues from 2003 through 2005 was primarily the result of increased auction and fixed price transaction activity, reflected in the growth in the number of our confirmed registered users, user activity, listings, gross merchandise volume and payment transactions processed by PayPal. eBay Marketplaces Net Transaction Revenues Total net transaction revenues from the U.S. and International Marketplaces segments in aggregate increased 36% in 2005, 48% in 2004, and 66% in 2003, compared to the respective prior year. The growth in both U.S. Marketplaces and International Marketplaces segment net transaction revenues was primarily the result of increased auction transaction activity, reflected in the growth of the number of registered users, active users, listings and gross merchandise volume. Gross merchandise volume from the U.S. and International Marketplaces segments together increased 30% in 2005, 44% in 2004 and 60% in 2003, compared to the respective prior year. U.S. and International Marketplaces segment net transaction revenues as a percentage of user gross merchandise volume was 7.7% for 2005, 7.3% for 2004, and 7.1% for 2003. The increases in 2005 reflected the growth in both domestic and international net transaction revenues due to increased transaction activity, reflected in the growth of the number of registered users, active users, listings and gross merchandise volume and revenue transactions from our acquired entities. The increases in 2004 and 2003 reflected increased feature adoption and the impact of our fee increases implemented in those years. In addition, there was gross merchandise volume growth across all major categories, with the motors, clothing & accessories, consumer electronics, home & garden, books/movies/music, sports, and computer categories having the most significant dollar impact. The number of active users on the eBay platform increased 28% during 2005 to 71.8 million at December 31, 2005. Active users increased 36% during 2004 to 56.1 million at December 31, 2004, from 41.2 million at December 31, 2003. We believe that increases in user activity are largely the result of our promotional efforts and our emphasis on helping our user community be successful through the introduction of new site features and functionality and expanded trust and safety programs, in addition to our international expansion. The number of items listed on eBays trading platforms increased 33% to 1.9 billion in 2005, from 1.4 billion in 2004, and increased 45% in 2004 from 971.0 million in 2003. This percentage growth in listings was experienced across our U.S. and, more significantly, our international platforms. U.S. Marketplaces Segment U.S. Marketplaces segment net transaction revenues increased 30% in 2005, 31% in 2004, and 43% in 2003, compared to the respective prior year. Gross merchandise volume from the U.S. Marketplaces segment increased 19% in 2005, 27% in 2004 and 41% in 2003, respectively. Net transaction revenues derived from the U.S. Marketplaces segment represented 39% of the total net transaction revenues in 2005. For 2005, the growth in our U.S. Marketplaces segments net transaction revenues was primarily the result of continued strong transaction activity and approximately $100 million in revenues from our recent acquisitions. We expect net transaction revenues from our U.S. Marketplaces segment to increase in 2006, but to decrease as a percentage of total eBay Marketplaces net transaction revenues as the International Marketplaces segment grows in significance. In addition, even as the U.S. Marketplaces segment continues to grow in absolute terms, we expect its growth rate in 2006 to be lower than that of 2005. International Marketplaces Segment International Marketplaces segment net transaction revenues increased 44% in 2005, 76% in 2004, and 121% in 2003, compared to the respective prior year. International Marketplaces segment net transaction revenues as a percentage of total net transaction revenues was 38% in 2005, 36% in 2004 and 31% in 2003. Gross merchandise volume from the International Marketplaces segment increased 42% in 2005, 70% in 2004, and 102% in 2003, compared to the respective prior year. For 2005, the growth in our International Marketplaces segment net transaction revenues, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net 53 Table of Contents transaction revenues, was primarily the result of strong performances in the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as significant increases in certain of our less established markets, particularly Australia, France and Italy. For 2004, the growth in our International Marketplaces segment net transaction revenues, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net transaction revenues, was primarily the result of strong performances in the United Kingdom, South Korea and Germany. The relative strength of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar resulted in increased net revenues of approximately $6.7 million during 2005, when compared to the results if the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates used in the preparation of our 2004 consolidated financial statements were used. Changes in foreign currency rates will impact our operating results and, to the extent that the U.S. dollar strengthens, our foreign currency denominated net revenues will be negatively impacted. We expect that the growth rates of our International Marketplaces segment transaction net revenues will continue to decline in 2006, although we expect such revenues to grow in significance relative to our total eBay Marketplaces as we continue to develop and deploy our global online commerce platform during 2006. Payments Segment Net Transaction Revenues Payments segment net transaction revenues increased 47% in 2005, 59% in 2004 and 360% in 2003, compared to the respective prior year. Payments segment net transaction revenues as a percentage of total net transaction revenues were 23% in 2005, 21% in 2004, and 20% in 2003. The growth in our Payments segment net transaction revenues, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net transaction revenues is primarily the result of increases in PayPal transaction volume driven by the growth in both eBay Marketplaces and PayPal merchant services transactions, and the higher penetration of PayPal in the eBay Marketplaces. During 2005, over $27.5 billion in total payment volume was transacted on the PayPal platform as compared to $18.9 billion during 2004. As of December 31, 2005, PayPal had 96.2 million accounts, compared to 63.8 million accounts at December 31, 2004. Our Payments segment net transaction revenues as a percentage of total payment volume was 3.6% in 2005 and 2004. The growth in Payments net transaction revenues was positively affected by PayPals continued penetration of eBay Marketplaces transactions in all countries, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. Further, Payments net transaction revenues have grown in connection with the increase in our eBay Marketplaces gross merchandise volume during 2004 and 2005. The relative strength of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, against the U.S. dollar, resulted in higher net revenues of approximately $5.3 million during 2005 when compared to the results if the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates used in the preparation of our 2004 consolidated financial statements were used. Net transaction revenues from the Payments segment earned internationally totaled $364.5 million in 2005 and $207.6 million in 2004, representing 36.4% and 30.5% of total Payments segment net transaction revenue, respectively. Changes in foreign currency rates will impact our operating results and, to the extent that the U.S. dollar strengthens, our foreign currency denominated net revenues will be negatively impacted. We expect the Payments segment net transaction revenues to increase in total during 2006 and for net transaction revenues earned internationally to increase in total and as a percentage of Payments net transaction revenues. We also expect that the Payments segment net transaction revenues will increase as a percentage of total net transaction revenues in 2006. Communications Segment Net Transaction Revenues Communications net transaction revenues were $24.8 million in 2005, which represents the revenue generated from VoIP offerings from our recent acquisition of Skype on October 14, 2005 through December 31, 2005. We expect the Communications segment net transaction revenues to increase in total and as a percentage of total net transactions revenues during 2006. For revenue generating offerings, revenue is recognized when the related offering is provided, or over the offering period. The majority of revenue offerings are prepaid. We record deferred revenue for the prepaid amounts in excess of revenue recognized. 54 Table of Contents Advertising and Other Non Transaction Net Revenues Advertising and other non transaction net revenues increased in total in 2005 as compared to 2004 and remained consistent as a percentage of revenue in 2005 as compared to 2004. Advertising and other net revenues totaled $123.4 million in 2005, $94.3 million in 2004 and $52.9 million in 2003. These amounts as a percentage of total net revenues represented 3% in 2005 and 2004 and 2% in 2003. We continue to view our business as primarily transaction driven and we expect advertising and other net revenues to continue to represent a relatively small proportion of total net revenues during 2006. Cost of Net Revenues Percent Percent 2003 Change 2004 Change 2005 (In thousands, except percentages) Cost of net revenues $ 416,058 48 % $ 614,415 33 % $ 818,104 As a percentage of net revenues 19.2 % 18.8 % 18.0 % Cost of net revenues consists primarily of costs associated with payment processing, site operations, and customer support. Significant cost components include bank charges, credit card interchange, other payment processing costs, employee compensation and facilities costs for our customer support and site operations, depreciation of equipment and amortization of required capitalization of major site and product development costs. The increase in cost of net revenues during 2005 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions on the Marketplaces and Payments websites and continued development and expansion of our customer support and site operations infrastructure. Payment processing costs increased to $403.1 million in 2005 from $305.1 million in 2004, due to the increase in PayPals total payment volume and increased payment processing costs related to the growth of our eBay Marketplaces activity. Aggregate customer support and site operations costs increased approximately $88.4 million during 2005, compared to the prior year. The decrease in cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to lower payment processing costs as a percentage of total payment volume in our payments segments as compared to prior periods. Costs of net revenues are expected to increase in total and as a percentage of net revenues during 2006 primarily due to the Payments and Communications businesses, each of which currently has a lower gross margin than our traditional marketplaces businesses. The increase in cost of net revenues during 2004 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions on the PayPal and eBay websites and continued development and expansion of our customer support and site operations infrastructure. The decrease in cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to eBays Marketplaces site operations costs growing at a slower rate than net revenues. Payment processing costs increased to $305.1 million in 2004 from $215.7 million in 2003, due to the increase in PayPals total payment volume and increased payment processing costs related to the growth of our eBay Marketplaces activity. Aggregate customer support and site operations costs increased $105.3 million during 2004, compared to the prior year, and resulted primarily from an increase in headcount and related employee costs and consultant costs of approximately $37.1 million and increased facilities costs of approximately $16.2 million. In addition, aggregate depreciation of site equipment and amortization of capitalized software development costs increased $36.0 million as compared to 2003. Operating Expenses Sales and Marketing Percent Percent 2003 Change 2004 Change 2005 (In thousands, except percentages) Sales and marketing $ 567,565 51 % $ 857,874 43 % $ 1,230,728 As a percentage of net revenues 26.2 % 26.2 % 27.0 % 55 Table of Contents Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising, tradeshow and other promotional costs, employee compensation for our category development and marketing staff and certain trust and safety programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased in 2005 and increased as a percentage of total net revenues due to our continued investment in growing our global user base. Growth in advertising and marketing costs as well as employee related costs comprised the majority of the increases. Combined advertising and marketing costs increased $228.8 million in 2005, compared to the prior year. This increase, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues, was primarily the result of international expansion and industry wide increases in Internet marketing rates, partially offset by marketing efficiencies. Employee related costs increased by $97.4 million in 2005 as we continued to expand our domestic and international operations. Sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in total and as a percentage of net revenues during 2006 due to the recent acquisition of Shopping.com which has higher sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues than our other businesses. In addition, our online marketing expenses are expected to increase because of increases in the volume of online advertising that we expect to purchase in order to attract new customers and increased user activity on our websites, including growth initiatives in sales and marketing activities in our Marketplaces segments. Sales and marketing expenses increased in 2004, but remained consistent as a percentage of total net revenues due to our continued investment in growing our user base and our development of new media campaigns. Growth in advertising and marketing costs as well as employee related costs comprised the majority of the increases. Combined advertising and marketing costs increased $169.8 million in 2004, compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of our internet marketing, domestic and international television, and radio advertising campaigns as well as several category focused print campaigns. Employee related costs increased by $68.4 million in 2004 as we continued to expand our domestic and international operations. Product Development Percent Percent 2003 Change 2004 Change 2005 (In thousands, except percentages) Product development $ 159,315 51 % $ 240,647 36 % $ 328,191 As a percentage of net revenues 7.4 % 7.4 % 7.2 % Product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, consultant costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. Product development expenses are net of required capitalization of major site and other product development efforts, including the development of our next generation platform architecture, migration of certain platforms, global billing, seller tools and payment gateway projects. These capitalized costs totaled $37.1 million in 2005, $41.3 million in 2004 and $38.5 million in 2003, and are reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods. We anticipate that we will continue to devote significant resources to product development in the future as we add new features and functionality to the Marketplaces, Payments and Communications businesses. The increase in product development expenses in 2005, as compared to the prior year, was primarily the result of increased headcount to support various platform development initiatives in our Marketplaces, Payments and Communications segments, domestically and internationally. Employee related costs increased by $63.9 million compared to the prior year. Our product development staff increased approximately 50% from approximately 1,500 at December 31, 2004 to approximately 2,200 at December 31, 2005. Product development expenses are expected to increase in total and may increase slightly as a percentage of net revenues in 2006, as we develop new site features and functionality and continue to improve and expand operations across all platforms. The increase in product development expenses in 2004, as compared to the prior year, was primarily the result of increased headcount and consultant costs. The headcount growth was focused on hiring new employees for various platform development initiatives at eBay and PayPal in addition to our international 56 Table of Contents expansion of both platforms. Our development staff increased approximately 48% from approximately 1,000 at December 31, 2003 to approximately 1,500 at December 31, 2004. In addition, our consultant costs increased by approximately $13.4 million. General and Administrative Percent Percent 2003 Change 2004 Change 2005 (In thousands, except percentages) General and administrative $ 332,668 25 % $ 415,725 42 % $ 591,716 As a percentage of net revenues 15.4 % 12.7 % 13.0 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, provisions for transaction losses associated with our Payments segment, depreciation of equipment, provision for doubtful accounts, insurance and professional fees. General and administrative expenses increased in total and remained consistent as a percentage of net revenues in 2005, as compared to the prior year. The dollar increase was due primarily to employee related and facilities costs. Employee related costs increased by approximately $111.3 million during 2005 as compared to the prior year. We increased our general and administrative employees from approximately 2,700 at December 31, 2004 to approximately 4,200 at December 31, 2005. This increase related primarily to the addition of employees in our trust and safety and corporate functions. Facilities costs increased by approximately $48.2 million during 2005 as compared to the prior year. PayPals transaction loss expense increased by approximately $23.3 million, to $73.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, reflecting the increase in activity in the Payments segment in addition to the expansion of our PayPal Buyer Protection Program. PayPals transaction loss expense rate, which is the transaction loss expense as a percentage of PayPals total payment volume, was consistent at 0.27% in 2005 and 2004. With our continued investment across all areas of our business and related corporate functions, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase during 2006, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as our revenue base increases at a higher rate. General and administrative expenses increased in total, but decreased as a percentage of net revenues in 2004, as compared to the prior year. The dollar increase was due primarily to employee related costs, fees for external professional advisors, including Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs, and payment transaction loss expenses. The increases in employee related costs resulted from growth in the finance, human resource and legal departments to meet the demands of our expanding business, including growing international operations, increased regulatory demands, and the integration of acquired businesses. We increased our general and administrative employees from approximately 1,900 at December 31, 2003 to approximately 2,700 at December 31, 2004. This increase related primarily to the addition of employees in our trust and safety functions. Consultant and employee related costs increased by approximately $53.8 million during 2004 as compared to the prior year. PayPals transaction loss expense increased by approximately $14.1 million, to $50.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2004, reflecting the increase in activity in the Payments segment in addition to the expansion of our PayPal Buyer Protection Program. PayPals transaction loss expense rate, which is the transaction loss expense as a percentage of PayPals total payment volume, was 0.27% in 2004 compared to 0.30% in 2003. The decrease in this percentage from 2003 to 2004 was offset in part by the increase in coverage for our PayPal Buyer Protection Program. Patent litigation expense of approximately $30 million during 2003 has been included in general and administrative expense and was related to the accrual of an August 6, 2003 court judgment resulting from the MercExchange patent infringement lawsuit. 57 Table of Contents Payroll Tax on Employee Stock Options Percent Percent 2003 Change 2004 Change 2005 (In thousands, except percentages) Payroll tax on employee stock options $ 9,590 82 % $ 17,479 (26 )% $ 13,014 As a percentage of net revenues 0.4 % 0.5 % 0.3 % We are subject to employer payroll taxes on employee gains from the exercise of non qualified stock options. These employer payroll taxes are recorded as a charge to operations in the period in which such options are exercised and sold based on actual gains realized by employees. The fluctuation in each respective year was primarily the result of the extent of employee gains recognized on stock option exercises. Our results of operations and cash flows could vary significantly depending on the actual period that stock options are exercised by employees and, consequently, the amount of employer payroll taxes assessed. In general, we expect payroll taxes on employee stock option gains to increase during periods in which our stock price is high relative to historic levels. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets Percent Percent 2003 Change 2004 Change 2005 (In thousands, except percentages) Amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 50,659 30 % $ 65,927 96 % $ 128,941 As a percentage of net revenues 2.3 % 2.0 % 2.8 % From time to time we have purchased, and we expect to continue purchasing, assets or businesses to accelerate category and geographic expansion increase the features, functions, and formats available to our users and maintain a leading role in online e commerce. These purchase transactions generally result in the creation of acquired intangible assets and lead to a corresponding increase in the amortization expense in future periods. The increase in amortization of acquired intangibles during 2005 compared to prior years is due to the business acquisitions consummated during 2004 and 2005. Intangible assets include purchased customer lists and user base, trademarks and trade names, developed technologies, and other intangible assets. We amortize intangible assets, excluding goodwill, over the period of estimated benefit, using the straight line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one to eight years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We evaluate goodwill, at a minimum, on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies data. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. Our annual impairment test was carried out as of August 31, 2005 and we determined that there was no impairment. There were no events or circumstances from that date through December 31, 2005 that would impact this assessment. We expect amortization of acquired intangible assets to increase in 2006 as a result of the intangible assets associated with our 2005 acquisitions. Amortization of acquired intangible assets may increase should we make additional acquisitions in the future. 58 Table of Contents Non Operating Items Interest and Other Income, Net Percent Percent 2003 Change 2004 Change 2005 (In thousands, except percentages) Interest and other income, net $ 36,573 129 % $ 77,867 43 % $ 111,148 As a percentage of net revenues 1.6 % 2.4 % 2.4 % Interest and other income, net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments as well as foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and other non operating transactions. Our interest and other income, net increased in total and remained consistent as a percentage of net revenues during 2005 as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of increased interest income due to increased cash, cash equivalents and investments balances and higher interest rates. The weighted average interest rate of our portfolio increased to 2.9% in 2005 from 1.7% in 2004. We expect that interest and other income, net, will remain consistent during 2006 compared to 2005, excluding the potential effects from our recent and future acquisitions. Our interest and other income, net increased in total and as a percentage of net revenues during 2004 as compared to 2003, primarily as a result of gains from the sale of an equity investment and amendments to certain sublease agreements. In addition, we recorded increased interest income primarily due to higher investment balances, and increased cash and cash equivalents balances. The weighted average interest rate of our portfolio increased to 1.7% in 2004 from 1.6% in 2003. During 2003 we recorded impairment charges totaling $1.2 million within interest and other income, net. Interest Expense Percent Percent 2003 Change 2004 Change 2005 (In thousands, except percentages) Interest expense $ 4,314 106 % $ 8,879 (61 )% $ 3,478 As a percentage of net revenues 0.2 % 0.3 % 0.1 % Interest expense consists of interest charges on our consolidated lease arrangement related to our San Jose headquarters office facilities, capital leases, and mortgage notes. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. In accordance with the provisions of this standard, we included our San Jose headquarters lease arrangement in our consolidated financial statements effective July 1, 2003. Beginning July 1, 2003, our consolidated statement of income reflected the reclassification of lease payments on our San Jose headquarters office facilities from operating expense to interest expense. The increase in interest expense during 2004 was primarily the result of the inclusion of these interest payments for the full year 2004. Interest expense decreased during 2005 primarily due to the payment of the lease obligation of our San Jose headquarters facility on March 1, 2005. We expect our interest expense will decrease both in total and as a percentage of net revenue during 2006. Provision for Income Taxes Percent Percent 2003 Change 2004 Change 2005 (In thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 206,738 66 % $ 343,885 36 % $ 467,285 As a percentage of net revenues 9.5 % 10.5 % 10.3 % Effective tax rate 32 % 30 % 30 % The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory U.S. federal rate principally due to state taxes, subsidiary losses for which we have not provided a benefit and other factors 59 Table of Contents that increase the effective tax rate, offset by decreases resulting from foreign income with lower effective tax rates and tax credits. The lower effective tax rates in 2005 and 2004 as compared to 2003 reflect the increasing profit contribution from our international operations that are subject to lower tax rates. Minority Interests Percent Percent 2003 Change 2004 Change 2005 (In thousands, except percentages) Minority interests $ (7,578 ) 19 % $ (6,122 ) (99 )% $ (49 ) As a percentage of net revenues 0.4 % 0.2 % 0.0 % Minority interests represents the minority investors percentage share of income or losses from subsidiaries in which we hold a majority ownership interest and consolidate the subsidiaries results in our financial statements. Third parties held minority interests in various of our subsidiaries during 2003, 2004 and 2005. The changes in minority interests in 2004 and 2005 were due primarily to our acquisition of a 38% additional ownership interest in Internet Auction during 2004, which brought our ownership to over 99%. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In accordance with the provisions of FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, we included our San Jose headquarters lease arrangement in our consolidated financial statements effective July 1, 2003. Our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2003 reflected the reclassification of lease payments on our San Jose headquarters from operating expense to interest expense, beginning with the quarters following our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003, a $5.4 million after tax charge for cumulative depreciation for periods from lease inception through June 30, 2003, and incremental depreciation expense of approximately $400,000, net of tax, per quarter for periods after June 30, 2003. We adopted the provisions of FIN 46 prospectively from July 1, 2003, and as a result, did not restate prior periods. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle arising from the adoption of FIN 46 was reflected in net income in 2003. As of December 31, 2004, we had $126.4 million included within current restricted cash and investments relating to our San Jose headquarters lease facility lease arrangement, which had effectively provided us with full ownership rights to these facilities. In February 2004, we elected not to extend the lease period, which required us to purchase the facility on March 1, 2005. We utilized the $126.4 million related restricted cash and investments to complete the purchase of the facility. Impact of Foreign Currency Translation During 2005, our international net revenues, based upon the country in which the seller, payment recipient, advertiser or other service provider is located, accounted for approximately 46% of our consolidated net revenues, as compared to 42% of our net revenues in 2004 and 35% of our net revenues in 2003. The growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Net revenues and related expenses generated from international locations are denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries, and include Euros, British pounds, Korean won, Canadian dollars, Taiwanese dollars, Australian dollars, Chinese renminbi, and Indian rupee. The results of operations and certain of our inter company balances associated with our international locations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The statements of income of our international operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period. To the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased consolidated net revenues, operating expenses and net income. During 2005, the U.S. dollar weakened against most of the foreign currencies listed above. Using the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates from 2004, our net revenues for 2005 would have been lower than reported using the actual exchange rates for 2005 by approximately $12.0 million. In addition, if 60 Table of Contents the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates from 2004 were applied to our cost of revenues and operating expenses for 2005, these costs of revenues and operating expenses would have been lower in total than reported using the actual exchange rates for 2005 by approximately $5.6 million. The majority of this impact relates to the relative strength of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. We expect our international operations will continue to grow in significance as we develop and deploy our global marketplaces and global payments platform. As a result, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in future periods could become more significant and may have a negative impact on our consolidated net revenues and net income in the event the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies. See the information in Item 7A under Foreign Currency Risk for additional discussion of the impact of foreign currency translation and related hedging activities. Foreign Exchange Hedging Policy We are a rapidly growing company, with an increasing proportion of our operations outside the United States. Accordingly, our foreign currency exposures have increased substantially and are expected to continue to grow. The objective of our foreign exchange exposure management program is to identify material foreign currency exposures and to manage these exposures to minimize the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flow, and results of operations. Our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction, economic and translation: Transaction Exposure: Around the world, we have certain assets and liabilities, primarily receivables, investments and accounts payable (including inter company transactions) that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional currency. In certain circumstances, changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other instruments to minimize the short term foreign currency fluctuations on such assets and liabilities. The gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset the transaction gains and losses on certain foreign currency receivables, investments and payables recognized in earnings. Economic Exposure: We also have anticipated and unrecognized future cash flows, including revenues and expenses, denominated in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional currency. Our primary economic exposures include future royalty receivables, customer collections, and vendor payments. Changes in the relevant entitys functional currency value will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge the value of a portion of these cash flows. We account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the transaction is settled. Earnings Translation Exposure: As our international operations grow, fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign denominated subsidiaries. We may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset the earnings impact of currency fluctuations. Such contracts will be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss will be recorded in interest and other income, net. Employee Stock Options We continue to believe that employee stock options represent an appropriate and essential component of our overall compensation program. We grant options to substantially all employees and believe that this broad based program helps us to attract, motivate, and retain high quality employees, to the ultimate benefit of our stockholders. Stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2005, net of cancellations, represented approximately 2% of our total common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2005. This represented a decrease from the approximately 3% of total common stock outstanding as of December 31, 61 Table of Contents 2004 represented by stock options granted, net of cancellations, during the year ended December 31, 2004. A substantial portion of our stock options granted during the year were granted to new employees. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Share Based Payment In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (FAS 123R) that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. The statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions, as we do currently, using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board, or APB, Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our consolidated statement of income. The statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options. We currently use the Black Scholes option pricing model to value options and are currently assessing which model we may use in the future under the new statement and may deem an alternative model to be more appropriate. The use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than the use of the Black Scholes option pricing model. In addition, there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that would result in differing accounting treatment than currently required. These differences include, but are not limited to, the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options and for stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan, and the presentation of these tax benefits within the consolidated statement of cash flows. In addition to the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments, we will also be required to determine the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The allowed transition methods are the prospective and retroactive adoption alternatives. The prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of FAS 123R, while the retroactive method requires companies to record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first disclosed period restated. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced the adoption of a new rule that amends the effective date of FAS 123R. The effective date of the new standard under these new rules for our consolidated financial statements is January 1, 2006. Adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan rather than disclose the impact on our consolidated net income within our footnotes, as is our current practice (see Note 1 The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein). The amounts disclosed within our footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of FAS 123R. We expect the compensation charges under FAS 123R to reduce earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.16 to $0.17 per share for the year ending December 31, 2006. Compensation expense calculated under FAS 123R may differ from amounts currently disclosed within our footnotes and may differ from our expectations based on changes in the fair value of our common stock, changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options, the treatment of tax benefits, and changes in interest rates or other factors. In addition, upon adoption of FAS 123R, we may choose to use a different valuation model to value the compensation expense associated with employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. 62 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 (In thousands) Consolidated Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 874,119 $ 1,285,315 $ 2,009,891 Investing activities (1,319,542 ) (2,013,220 ) (2,452,731 ) Financing activities 688,866 647,669 471,606 Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 28,757 28,768 (45,231 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 272,200 $ (51,468 ) $ (16,465 ) We have generated annual cash provided by operating activities in amounts greater than net income in 2003, 2004 and 2005 due primarily to the tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options and non cash charges to earnings. Non cash charges to earnings included depreciation and amortization on our long term assets, provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits resulting from increasing revenues and the provision for transaction losses resulting from increased total payment volumes processed by our PayPal subsidiary. In 2005 and 2003, operating cash flows were also positively impacted by the net cash amounts provided by year over year changes in working capital assets and liabilities. The net cash used in investing activities in 2003, 2004 and 2005 reflected primarily the movement of cash and cash equivalents between cash and cash equivalents and investments, the purchase of property and equipment, and acquisitions. Purchases of property and equipment, net totaled $338.3 million in 2005, $292.8 million in 2004, and $365.4 million in 2003. Purchases of property and equipment in 2005 and 2004 related mainly to purchases of computer equipment and software to support our site operations, customer support and international expansion. In 2003, purchases of property and equipment included the $125.1 million purchase of additional office space in San Jose, California. Purchases of property and equipment in 2003 also included amounts for improvements to various facilities in the U.S. and around the world as well as computer equipment and software to support our site operations, customer support and international expansion. Cash expended for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, totaled approximately $2.7 billion in 2005, $1.0 billion in 2004 and $216.4 million in 2003. In 2005, net cash payments for acquisitions consisted primarily of the cash payment, net of cash acquired for the acquisition of Rent.com, certain international classifieds websites, Shopping.com, Skype and the payment gateway business acquired from VeriSign. In 2004, our cash acquisitions included the acquisition of mobile.de, Baazee.com, and Marktplaats.nl, as well as an additional ownership interest in Internet Auction Co. Our cash acquisitions in 2003 included acquiring the remaining ownership interest in EachNet and an additional ownership interest in Internet Auction Co. The net cash flows provided by financing activities in 2003, 2004 and 2005 were due primarily to proceeds from stock option exercises. Proceeds from stock option exercises totaled $599.8 million in 2005, $650.6 million in 2004, and $700.8 million in 2003. Our future cash flows from stock options are difficult to project as such amounts are a function of our stock price, the number of options outstanding and the decisions by employees to exercise stock options. In general, we expect proceeds from stock option exercises to increase during periods in which our stock price has increased relative to historical levels. The negative effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2005 was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. The positive effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2004 and 2003 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. 63 Table of Contents We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, together with any cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations for the foreseeable future. However, if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flows from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, our business could suffer. Commitments and Contingencies We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables, in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments (in thousands): Other Operating Purchase Payments Due By Year Ending December 31, Leases Obligations Total 2006 $ 22,988 $ 324,237 $ 347,225 2007 19,455 33,893 53,348 2008 17,141 15,014 32,155 2009 15,259 3,533 18,792 2010 12,035 2,374 14,409 Thereafter 53,287 53,287 $ 140,165 $ 379,051 $ 519,216 Operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non cancelable operating leases for office facilities, as well as limited computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to exit an office facility early or expand our occupied space. Other purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, computer equipment, software applications, engineering development services and other goods and services that were entered into through our ordinary course of business. For those contractual arrangements in which there are significant performance requirements, we have developed estimates to project expected payment obligations. These estimates have been developed based upon historical trends, when available, and our anticipated future obligations. Given the significance of such performance requirements within our advertising and other arrangements, actual payments could differ significantly from these estimates. In conjunction with our Skype acquisition, in addition to the initial consideration that has already been paid to former Skype shareholders, we have certain earn out payments that are contingent upon Skype achieving certain net revenue, gross profit margin based targets and active user targets. See Note 3 Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2005, we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition changes, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 64 Table of Contents Indemnification Provisions In the ordinary course of business we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application programming interface license agreements. Under these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by any third party with respect to domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement. In a limited number of agreements, including agreements under which we have developed technology for certain commercial parties, we have provided an indemnity for other types of third party claims, substantially all of which are indemnities related to our copyrights, trademarks, and patents. To date, no significant costs have been incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection with our indemnification provisions. Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates General The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this report. Provisions for Doubtful Accounts and Authorized Credits Our U.S. Marketplaces and International Marketplaces segments are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and credits to sellers. Provisions for these items represent our estimate of actual losses and credits based on our historical experience, are monitored monthly, and are made at the time the related revenue is recognized. The provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to operating expense, while the authorized credits are recorded as a reduction of revenues. The following table illustrates the provision related to doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a percentage of net revenues for 2003, 2004, and 2005 (in thousands, except percentages). Years Ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 Net revenues from the U.S. and International segments $ 1,727,474 $ 2,573,607 $ 3,499,137 Doubtful accounts and authorized credits $ 46,049 $ 90,942 $ 89,499 Provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a % of net revenues from the U.S. and International segments 2.67 % 3.53 % 2.56 % Historically, our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions. However, future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of income and cash flows. 65 Table of Contents Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 25 basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income of approximately $8.7 million. The following analysis demonstrates, for illustrative purposes only, the potential effect a 25 basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands, except per share data): 25 Basis +25 Basis Points 2005 Points Expense related to doubtful accounts and revenue reduction related to authorized credits $ 80,751 $ 89,499 $ 98,247 Income from operations 1,450,455 1,441,707 1,432,959 Net income 1,090,791 1,082,043 1,073,295 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.78 $ 0.78 $ 0.77 Provision for Transaction Losses Our Payments segment is exposed to transaction losses due to credit card and other payment misuse, as well as non performance of sellers who accept payment through PayPal. We establish allowances for estimated losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as charge backs for unauthorized credit card use and merchant related charge backs due to non delivery of goods or services, Automated Clearing House, or ACH, returns, buyer protection program claims and debit card overdrafts. These allowances represent an accumulation of the estimated amounts, necessary to provide for transaction losses incurred as of the reporting date, including those of which we have not yet been notified. The allowances, which involve the use of actuarial techniques, are monitored monthly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors. The allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including our experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types. The provision for transaction losses is reflected as a general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income. At December 31, 2005, the allowance for transaction losses totaled $20.2 million and was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The following table illustrates the provision for transaction losses as a percentage of total payment volume from PayPal operations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 (in thousands, except percentages). Years Ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 Total payment volume $ 12,226,000 $ 18,915,000 $ 27,485,000 Transaction loss expense $ 36,401 $ 50,459 $ 73,773 As a % of total payment volume 0.30 % 0.27 % 0.27 % The establishment of appropriate allowances for transaction losses is an inherently uncertain process, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2005, a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our operating expenses of approximately $13.7 million. The following analysis demonstrates, for illustrative purposes only, the potential effect a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 66 Table of Contents 2005, and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands, except per share data): 5 Basis +5 Basis Points 2005 Points Transaction loss expense $ 60,030 $ 73,773 $ 87,516 Income from operations 1,455,450 1,441,707 1,427,964 Net income 1,095,786 1,082,043 1,068,300 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.79 $ 0.78 $ 0.77 Legal Contingencies In connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events. From time to time, we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we do not expect this trend to change in the future. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in Item 3: Legal Proceedings and Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies Litigation and Other Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us, and we will defend ourselves vigorously. However, even if successful, our defense against certain actions will be costly and could divert our managements time. If the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims, we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business. Any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of all or any of our three segments. Accounting for Income Taxes We are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon the taxable income and temporary differences for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws around the world and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities, including various accruals, allowances, depreciation and amortization. The tax effect of these temporary differences and the estimated tax benefit from our tax net operating losses are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax asset will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2005, we have a valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our tax provision in our consolidated statement of income. Where the change in the valuation allowance relates to the tax deduction for employee stock option exercises, the change is reflected in additional paid in capital. Beginning in 2006, any remaining deferred tax asset related to stock option deductions will be recognized in the periods when the benefit is received and, as such, a valuation allowance will not be required. Our U.S. businesses generate sufficient cash flow to fully fund their operating requirements, and we expect that profits earned outside the U.S. will be fully utilized to fund our continued international expansion. Accordingly, we have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on non U.S. subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2005, because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. In the event that our future international expansion plans change and such amounts are not reinvested indefinitely, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes partially offset by foreign tax credits. 67 Table of Contents The following table illustrates the effective tax rates for 2003, 2004, and 2005 (in thousands, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 Provision for income taxes $ 206,738 $ 343,885 $ 467,285 As a % of income before income taxes 32 % 30 % 30 % Historically, these provisions have adequately provided for our actual income tax liabilities. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuations of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes or interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2005, a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately $15.5 million. The following analysis demonstrates, for illustrative purposes only, the potential effect such a one percentage point deviation change would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands, except per share data): 100 Basis +100 Basis Points 2005 Points Provision for income taxes $ 451,791 $ 467,285 $ 482,779 Income from operations 1,441,707 1,441,707 1,441.707 Net income 1,097,537 1,082,043 1,066,549 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.79 $ 0.78 $ 0.77 Advertising and Other Non Transaction Revenues A portion of our net revenues result from fees associated with advertising and other non transaction services in our U.S. Marketplaces, International Marketplaces and Payments segments. Net revenues from advertising are derived principally from the sale of online banner and sponsorship advertisements for cash and through barter arrangements. Other non transaction net revenues are derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide transaction services to eBay users and from offline services provided by wholly owned subsidiaries that were divested in the second half of 2002. Advertising and other non transaction net revenues, including barter transactions, totaled 2%, 3% and 3% of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively, and were primarily generated by our U.S. Marketplaces segment. Revenue from barter arrangements totaled $10.1 million in 2003, $13.3 million in 2004 and $6.7 million in 2005. Certain judgments are involved in the determination of the appropriate revenue recognition, including, but not limited to, the assessment and allocation of fair values in multiple element arrangements, the appropriateness of gross or net revenue recognition and, for barter transactions, the existence of comparable cash transactions to establish fair values. Our advertising and other non transaction net revenues may be affected by the financial condition of the parties with whom we have these relationships and by the success of online services and promotions in general. Unlike our transaction revenues, advertising and other non transaction net revenues are derived from a relatively concentrated customer base. Business Combinations The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital. 68 Table of Contents At December 31, 2005 our goodwill totaled $6.1 billion and our identifiable intangible assets totaled $823.3 million. We assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of our reportable units annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. This assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization. The estimate of cash flow is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management. Our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to its business model or changes in operating performance. Significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of August 31, 2005 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill for any of our reportable units was required. We have determined that no events or circumstances from that date through December 31, 2005 indicate that a further assessment was necessary. ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities, including government and corporate securities and money market funds. These securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of estimated tax. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk. The fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. In general, securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed rate securities, floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease. Due in part to these factors, our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2005, our fixed income investments earned a pretax yield of approximately 3.3%, with a weighted average maturity of three months. If interest rates were to instantaneously increase (decrease) by 100 basis points, the fair market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease (increase) by approximately $6.3 million. Equity Price Risk We are exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of equity instruments and equity method investments we hold, typically as the result of strategic investments in third parties that are subject to considerable market risk due to their volatility. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure in these equity investments. We did not record an impairment charge during either of the years ended December 31, 2005 or 2004 relating to the other than temporary impairment in the fair value of equity investments. At December 31, 2005, the total carrying value of our equity instruments and equity method investments was $51.9 million. Foreign Currency Risk International net revenues result from transactions by our foreign operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country. These operations also incur most of their expenses in the local currency. Accordingly, our foreign operations use the local currency, which is primarily the Euro, and to a lesser extent, the British pound, as their functional currency. Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other 69 Table of Contents factors. In addition, at December 31, 2005, we held balances in cash, cash equivalents and investments outside the U.S. totaling approximately $0.8 billion. During 2005, the U.S. dollar weakened against most of the foreign currencies listed above. Using the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates from 2004, our net revenues for 2005 would have been lower than reported using the actual exchange rates for 2005 by approximately $12.0 million, of which $6.7 million and $5.3 million relate to our International Marketplaces and Payments segments, respectively. In addition, if the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates from 2004 were applied to our cost of revenues and operating expenses for 2005, these costs of revenues and operating expenses would have been lower in total than reported using the actual exchange rates for 2005 by approximately $5.6 million. The majority of this impact relates to the relative strength of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. Transaction Exposure: As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding forward foreign exchange hedge contracts with notional values equivalent to approximately $151.5 million with maturity dates within 31 days. The hedge contracts are used to offset changes in the functional currency value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as a result of currency fluctuations. Transaction gains and losses on the contracts and the assets and liabilities are recognized each period in our consolidated statement of income. Translation Exposure: Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as well as our consolidated results of operations. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet. The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position for the year ended December 31, 2005, was a net translation loss of approximately $140.5 million. This loss is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of income. We consolidate the earnings of our international subsidiaries by converting them into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation (FAS 52). Such earnings will fluctuate when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates. From time to time, we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency denominated earnings translation exposure using both foreign currency options and forward contracts. All contracts that hedge translation exposure mature ratably over the quarter in which they are executed. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the realized gains and losses related to these hedges were not significant. Economic Exposure: We currently charge our international subsidiaries on a monthly basis for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services provided by eBay and PayPal. These charges are denominated in Euros and these forecasted inter company transactions represent a foreign currency cash flow exposure. To reduce foreign exchange risk relating to these forecasted inter company transactions, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts during the year ended December 31, 2005. The objective of the forward contracts is to ensure that the U.S. dollar equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the U.S. dollar/ Euro exchange rate. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133), we expect the hedge of certain of these forecasted transactions using the forward contracts to be highly effective in offsetting potential changes in cash flows attributed to a change in the U.S. dollar/ Euro exchange rate. Accordingly, we record as a component of other comprehensive income all unrealized gains and losses related to the forward contracts that receive hedge accounting treatment. We record all unrealized gains and losses in interest and accumulated other income, net, related to the forward contracts that do not receive hedge accounting 70 Table of Contents treatment pursuant to FAS 133. During the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, the realized gains and losses related to these hedges were not significant. The notional amount of our economic hedges receiving hedge accounting treatment and the losses, net of gains, recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2004 was $140.2 million and $3.4 million, respectively. The notional amount of our economic hedges receiving hedge accounting treatment and the loss, net of gains, recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2005 was $203.0 million and $200,000 respectively.
