We operate three primary business segments, Marketplaces, Payments and Communications. We provide online marketplaces for the sale of goods and services, online payments services and online communication offerings to a diverse community of individuals and businesses. Our Marketplaces segment provides the infrastructure to enable online commerce in a variety of platforms, including the traditional eBay.com platform, along with our other online platforms, such as Shopping.com, classifieds websites and Rent.com. Our wide array of marketplaces websites brings together millions of buyers and sellers every day on a local, national and international basis. Our Payments segment, which consists of PayPal, enables individuals or businesses to securely, easily and quickly send and receive payments online. Our Communications segment, which consists of Skype, enables VoIP calls between Skype users, and also provides Skype users low cost connectivity to traditional fixed line and mobile telephones. Executive Operating and Financial Summary Our focus is on key operating and financial metrics Members of our senior management team regularly review key operating metrics such as registered users, active users, listings, gross merchandise volume, eBay stores, total accounts, active accounts, total number of payments, total payment volume, and transaction rates. Members of our senior management also regularly review key financial information including net revenues, operating income margins, earnings per share, cash flows from operations and free cash flows, which we define as operating cash flows less purchases of property and equipment, net. These operating and financial measures allow us to monitor the health and vibrancy of our Marketplaces, Payments, and Communications segments and the profitability of our business and to evaluate the effectiveness of investments that we have made and continue to make in the areas of marketing, product development, international expansion, customer support and site operations. We believe that an understanding of these key operating and financial measures and how they change over time is important to investors, analysts and other parties analyzing our business results and future market opportunities. 2006 summary In 2006, we generated nearly $6.0 billion in net revenues, representing a 31% year over year growth rate; we earned nearly $1.4 billion in operating income; and we closed the year with $3.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments after taking into account the repurchase of approximately 54.5 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1.7 billion. During 2006, we focused on integrating the businesses we acquired in 2005, which allowed us to strengthen our leadership position in each of our three key business areas in the U.S. and abroad. We expanded our user base in all three business segments, and as of December 31, 2006 we had 222 million eBay registered users; 133 million PayPal accounts; and 171 million Skype registered users. Our expectations for growth We expect that growth in our net revenues during 2007 will result primarily from increased net transaction revenues across our Marketplaces, Payments and Communications segments. We expect to continue our investments in the areas of product development, customer support and international expansion across all segments. We believe these investments are necessary to support the long term demands of our growing business. In addition, to the extent that the U.S. dollar fluctuates against foreign currencies, and, in particular, the Euro, British pound and Korean won, the remeasurement of these foreign currency denominated transactions into U.S. dollars will impact our consolidated net revenues and, to the extent that they are not hedged successfully, our net income. The discussion of our consolidated financial results contained herein is intended to assist those reading this report to better understand the key operating and financial measures summarized above as well as the changes in our consolidated results of operations from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. 43 Table of Contents Seasonality The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, our total net revenues and the sequential quarterly growth of these net revenues. Quarter Ended March 31 June 30 September 30 December 31 (In thousands, except percentages) 2004 Net revenues $ 756,239 $ 773,412 $ 805,876 $ 935,782 Current quarter vs prior quarter 17 % 2 % 4 % 16 % 2005 Net revenues $ 1,031,724 $ 1,086,303 $ 1,105,515 $ 1,328,859 Current quarter vs prior quarter 10 % 5 % 2 % 20 % 2006 Net revenues $ 1,390,419 $ 1,410,784 $ 1,448,637 $ 1,719,901 Current quarter vs prior quarter 5 % 1 % 3 % 19 % We expect transaction activity patterns on our websites to increasingly mirror general consumer buying patterns, both online and offline, as our business expands, with the strongest sequential growth occurring in the fourth quarter. Our expectation is that Skypes business will experience seasonally slower growth during holiday and vacation periods. 44 Table of Contents Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, the breakdown of net revenues by type, segment and geography. In addition, we have provided a table of key metrics that drive our revenue results.

(10) Cumulative number of unique user accounts created on Skype. Our net transaction revenues from our Marketplaces segment are derived primarily from listing, feature and final value fees paid by sellers and lead referral fees. For our Payments segment, net transaction revenues are generated primarily by fees from payment processing services. Our Communications segment primarily generates net transaction revenues from fees charged to users to connect Skypes VoIP network to traditional telecommunication networks. These fees are charged on a per minute basis and we refer to these minutes as SkypeOut minutes. Net revenues from advertising are derived principally from the sale of advertisements for cash and through barter arrangements. Other net revenues are derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide transaction services to eBay and PayPal users and interest earned from banks on certain PayPal customer account balances. 46 Table of Contents Marketplaces Net Transaction Revenues Total net transaction revenues from Marketplaces increased 24% in 2006 and 36% in 2005, compared to the respective prior year. The growth in net transaction revenues was the result of increased auction transaction activity, reflected in the growth of the number of registered users, active users, listings and gross merchandise volume. The number of registered users increased 23% during 2006 to 221.6 million at December 31, 2006. The number of registered users increased 33% during 2005 to 180.6 million at December 31, 2005. The number of active users on eBay.com increased 14% during 2006 to 81.8 million at December 31, 2006. Active users increased 28% during 2005 to 71.8 million at December 31, 2005. We believe that increases in user activity are largely the result of our promotional efforts, our emphasis on helping our user community be successful through the introduction of new site features and functionality, our international expansion, and expanded trust and safety programs. The number of items listed on eBay.coms platforms increased 26% to 2.4 billion in 2006, from 1.9 billion in 2005, and increased 33% in 2005 from 1.4 billion in 2004. This percentage growth in listings was experienced across our U.S. and international platforms. The number of stores increased by 55% and 51% in 2006 and 2005, compared to the respective prior year, due to the cost effective nature for sellers to list items on our eBay Stores format. Gross merchandise volume increased 18% in 2006 and 30% in 2005, compared to the respective prior year. The increases in 2006 and 2005 resulted from the domestic and international growth in the number of registered users, active users and listings. In addition, there was gross merchandise volume growth across all major categories, with the motors, consumer electronics, clothing & accessories, computers, home & garden, books/movies/music, sports, and collectibles categories having the most significant dollar impact. Marketplaces net transaction revenues earned internationally totaled $2.1 billion in 2006, $1.7 billion in 2005 and $1.2 billion in 2004, representing 50%, 49% and 46% of total Marketplaces net transaction revenues, respectively. Marketplaces net revenues were positively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $30.6 million and $6.7 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Changes in foreign currency rates will impact our operating results and, to the extent that the U.S. dollar strengthens, our foreign currency denominated net revenues will be negatively impacted. In 2007, we expect Marketplaces net transaction revenues to continue to increase due to continued growth in the global e commerce market. Payments Net Transaction Revenues Payments net transaction revenues increased 40% in 2006 and 47% in 2005, compared to the respective prior year. Payments net transaction revenues as a percentage of total net transaction revenues were 24% in 2006, 23% in 2005, and 21% in 2004. During 2006, over $37.8 billion in total payment volume was transacted on the PayPal platform as compared to $27.5 billion during 2005 and $18.9 billion during 2004. As of December 31, 2006, PayPal had 133.0 million accounts, compared to 96.2 million at December 31, 2005 and 63.8 million accounts at December 31, 2004. Net transaction revenues as a percentage of total payment volume was 4% in all years presented. The growth in our Payments net transaction revenues, in all years, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net transaction revenues, was primarily the result of increases in PayPal transaction volume driven by the growth in PayPal Merchant Services transactions, the higher penetration of PayPal in the Marketplaces platforms and growth in gross merchandise volume in the Marketplaces segment. In 2006, our global Merchant Services total payment volume increased 59% compared to 2005, generating total payment volume of $13.3 billion. In 2005, our global Merchant Services total payment volume increased 48% compared to 2004, generating total payment volume of $8.4 billion. Furthermore, the growth in Payments net transactions revenues in 2006 was positively affected by PayPals continued penetration of Marketplaces transactions which increased to 57.2% in 2006 from 52.7% in 2005 and 46.7% in 2004. Payments net transaction revenues have grown in connection with the increase in our Marketplaces gross merchandise volume which increased to $52.5 billion in 2006 compared to $44.3 billion in 2005 and $34.2 billion in 2004. 47 Table of Contents Net transaction revenues from Payments earned internationally totaled $533.2 million in 2006, $364.5 million in 2005 and $207.6 million in 2004, representing 38.0%, 36.4% and 30.5% of total Payments segment net transaction revenues, respectively. Payments net revenues were positively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $4.3 million and $5.3 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Changes in foreign currency rates will impact our operating results and, to the extent that the U.S. dollar strengthens, our foreign currency denominated net revenues will be negatively impacted. In 2007, we expect the Payments net transaction revenues to increase in total and for net transaction revenues earned internationally to increase in total and as a percentage of Payments net transaction revenues. We expect to grow our merchant service business and continue to drive higher penetration rates on Marketplaces platforms. We also expect that Payments net transaction revenues will increase as a percentage of total net transaction revenues in 2007. Communications Net Transaction Revenues Communications net transaction revenues were $192.8 million in 2006 as compared to $24.8 million in 2005 (net revenues from the acquisition date of October 14, 2005 through the end of 2005). The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a full year of revenues generated from our VoIP offerings in 2006. The cumulative number of Skype registered users increased to 171.2 million at December 31, 2006 from 74.7 million at December 31, 2005. Additionally, SkypeOut minutes increased to 4.1 billion, which resulted in $177.7 million in revenue in 2006. The growth was due to rapid user expansion. Net transaction revenues from Communications earned internationally totaled $163.7 million in 2006 and $21.4 million in 2005, representing 85% and 87% of total Communications net transaction revenues, respectively. Communications net revenue was positively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $5.1 million in 2006. Changes in foreign currency rates will impact our operating results and, to the extent that the U.S. dollar strengthens, our foreign currency denominated net revenues will be negatively impacted. We expect Communications net transaction revenues to increase during 2007 as we expect to continue to increase both our user base and product offerings. Advertising and Other Net Revenues Advertising and other net revenues totaled $171.8 million in 2006, $123.4 million in 2005 and $94.3 million in 2004. These amounts represented 3% of total net revenues for all years presented. We continue to view our business as primarily transaction driven and we expect advertising and other net revenues to continue to represent a relatively small proportion of total net revenues during 2007. 48 Table of Contents Summary of cost of net revenues, operating expenses, non operating items and provision for income taxes The following table summarizes changes in cost of net revenues, sales and marketing expense, product development expense, general and administrative expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, interest and other income, net, interest expense, provision for income taxes and minority interest (note that 2006 amounts reflect the modified prospective adoption of FAS 123(R)): Change from Change from Year Ended December 31, 2004 to 2005 2005 to 2006 2004 2005 2006 In dollars In % In dollars In % (In thousands, except percentages) Cost of net revenues $ 614,415 $ 818,104 $ 1,256,792 $ 203,689 33 % 438,688 54 % Sales and marketing 815,464 1,185,929 1,619,857 370,465 45 % 433,928 37 % Product development 240,647 328,191 494,695 87,544 36 % 166,504 51 % General and administrative 475,614 649,529 978,363 173,915 37 % 328,834 51 % Amortization of acquired intangible assets 65,927 128,941 197,078 63,014 96 % 68,137 53 % Interest and other income, net 77,867 111,148 130,021 33,281 43 % 18,873 17 % Interest expense 8,879 3,478 5,916 (5,401 ) 61 % 2,438 70 % Provision for income taxes 343,885 467,285 421,418 123,400 36 % (45,867 ) 10 % Minority interests 6,122 49 4 (6,073 ) 99 % (45 ) 92 % As of January 1, 2006, we began accounting for stock based compensation under FAS 123(R), which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation. We adopted FAS 123(R) using the modified prospective method which requires the application of the accounting standard as of January 1, 2006. In accordance with the modified prospective method, the consolidated financial statements for 2004 and 2005 have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of FAS 123(R). Stock based compensation expense related to stock options and employee stock purchases for 2004, 2005 and 2006 was allocated as follows (in thousands): 2004 2005 2006 Cost of net revenues $ 233 $ 1,881 $ 32,981 Sales and marketing 136 8,696 96,547 Product development 654 6,468 81,489 General and administrative 4,809 14,727 106,393 Total stock based compensation expense 5,832 31,772 317,410 Tax benefit (4,117 ) (13,023 ) (97,572 ) Stock based compensation expense, net of tax $ 1,715 $ 18,749 $ 219,838 As of December 31, 2006, there was approximately $418.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, excluding tax benefits, related to stock based incentive awards granted under our equity incentive plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of three years. Cost of Net Revenues 2004 2005 2006 (In thousands, except percentages) Cost of net revenues $ 614,415 $ 818,104 $ 1,256,792 As a percentage of net revenues 18.8 % 18.0 % 21.1 % Cost of net revenues consists primarily of costs associated with payment processing, customer support and site operations, and Skype telecommunications costs. Significant cost components include bank charges, credit card interchange and assessments, other payment processing costs, employee compensation, consultant costs and 49 Table of Contents facilities costs for our customer support and site operations, depreciation of equipment and amortization of capitalized product development costs and telecommunication costs. The increase in cost of net revenues of $438.7 million during 2006 was primarily due to an increase in payment processing costs, Skype telecommunication costs, the development and expansion of our customer support and site operations infrastructure, and the effect of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases under FAS 123(R). Payment processing costs increased approximately $114.5 million, or 30%, in 2006 compared to the prior year, due to the 37% increase in PayPals total payment volume and increases in the proportion of customer transactions funded with credit cards. Skype telecommunications costs increased by $105.5 million in 2006 compared to the prior year due to the inclusion of a full year of Skypes costs. Aggregate customer support and site operations costs (including stock based compensation) increased approximately $202.8 million, or 52%, in 2006 compared to the prior year. Expanding our global site and support infrastructure contributed $161.2 million of this increase as employee costs increased approximately $44.7 million; we increased the use of contractors and consultants by approximately $32.9 million; facility costs increased approximately $28.9 million; and depreciation expense associated with computer equipment and capitalized software increased approximately $54.7 million. Stock based compensation expense of $33.0 million was included in cost of revenues in 2006 compared to $1.9 million in 2005. Stock based compensation expense increased due to our implementation of FAS 123(R) at the beginning of 2006. The increase in cost of net revenues during 2005 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions on the Marketplaces and Payments websites and continued development and expansion of our customer support and site operations infrastructure. Payment processing costs increased to $403.1 million in 2005 from $305.1 million in 2004, due to the increase in PayPals total payment volume and increased payment processing costs related to the growth of our Marketplaces activity. Aggregate customer support and site operations costs increased approximately $88.4 million during 2005, compared to the prior year. Costs of net revenues are expected to increase in total and as a percentage of net revenues during 2007 primarily due to growth in Payments and Communications, each of which is growing faster and has a lower gross margin than Marketplaces. Sales and Marketing 2004 2005 2006 (In thousands, except percentages) Sales and marketing $ 815,464 $ 1,185,929 $ 1,619,857 As a percentage of net revenues 24.9 % 26.1 % 27.1 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising costs, marketing programs and employee compensation for sales and marketing staff. Sales and marketing expenses increased in total and increased as a percentage of total net revenues in 2006 due to our continued investment in growing our global user base and the effect of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases under FAS 123(R). Growth in advertising and marketing costs as well as employee related costs comprised the majority of the increases. Combined advertising and marketing costs increased $250.5 million in 2006, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in global television and online marketing campaigns. Employee related costs, not including stock based compensation expense, increased by $69.3 million in 2006 as we continued to expand our domestic and international operations. Sales and marketing staff increased from approximately 2,500 at December 31, 2005 to approximately 2,700 at December 31, 2006.

Stock based compensation expense increased due to our implementation of FAS 123(R) at the beginning of 2006. Sales and marketing expenses increased in total and increased as a percentage of total net revenues in 2005 due to our continued investment in growing our global user base. Growth in advertising and marketing costs as well as employee related costs comprised the majority of the increases. Combined advertising and marketing costs increased $228.8 million in 2005, compared to the prior year. This increase, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues, was primarily the result of international expansion and industry wide increases in Internet 50 Table of Contents marketing rates, partially offset by marketing efficiencies. Employee related costs increased by $97.4 million in 2005 as we continued to expand our domestic and international operations. Sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in total during 2007 because of expected increases in our online marketing expense to attract new customers and increase user activity across our businesses. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues are expected to decrease during 2007 due to the growth in Payments and Communications, each of which, has lower sales and marketing expenses than Marketplaces. Product Development 2004 2005 2006 (In thousands, except percentages) Product development $ 240,647 $ 328,191 $ 494,695 As a percentage of net revenues 7.4 % 7.2 % 8.3 % Product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, consultant costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. Product development expenses are net of required capitalization of major site and other product development efforts, including the development of our next generation platform architecture, migration of certain platforms, seller tools and PayPal services integration projects. These capitalized costs totaled $67.9 million in 2006, $37.1 million in 2005 and $41.3 million in 2004, and are reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods. The increase in product development expense of $166.5 million during 2006 was primarily due to employees added, including contractors and consultants, to support various platform and software development initiatives in our Marketplaces, Payments and Communications segments and the effect of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases under FAS 123(R). Employee related and consultant costs, excluding stock based compensation, increased by approximately $61.5 million in 2006 compared to the prior year. Our product development staff increased from approximately 2,200 at December 31, 2005 to approximately 2,500 at December 31, 2006. Stock based compensation expense of $81.5 million was included in product development expense in 2006 compared to $6.5 million in 2005. Stock based compensation expense increased due to our implementation of FAS 123(R) at the beginning of 2006. The increase in product development expenses in 2005, as compared to the prior year, was primarily the result of increased headcount to support various platform development initiatives in our Marketplaces, Payments and Communications segments. Employee related costs increased by $63.9 million compared to the prior year. Our product development staff increased nearly 50% from approximately 1,500 at December 31, 2004 to approximately 2,200 at December 31, 2005. Product development expenses are expected to increase in total and remain consistent as a percentage of net revenues in 2007, as we develop new site features and functionality and continue to improve and expand operations across all businesses. General and Administrative 2004 2005 2006 (In thousands, except percentages) General and administrative $ 475,614 $ 649,529 $ 978,363 As a percentage of net revenues 14.5 % 14.3 % 16.4 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, consultant costs, provisions for transaction losses associated with our Payments segment, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment, provision for doubtful accounts, payroll taxes on employee stock options, insurance and professional fees. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $328.8 million during 2006 was primarily due to increased employee related costs, consultant costs, higher Payments transaction loss expenses, and the effect of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases under FAS 123(R). Employee related costs and consultant costs increased by approximately $112.6 million during 2006 as compared to the prior year due to our continued focus on user protection programs. We increased our general and administrative employee headcount from approximately 4,200 at December 31, 2005 to 4,900 at 51 Table of Contents December 31, 2006, of which, approximately 450 employees were added to support our consumer protection programs. Transaction loss rate in our Payments segment, which is the transaction loss expense as a percentage of total payment volume, increased to 0.33% in 2006 compared to 0.27% in 2005, causing an increase in expense of approximately $52.7 million. The increase in the transaction loss rate was primarily due to higher levels of credit card chargebacks from unauthorized credit card transactions. The higher levels of credit card chargebacks is due to strategically entering into new customer segments (new countries and direct card processing) which have higher loss rates. Stock based compensation expense of $106.4 million was included in general and administrative expense in 2006 compared to $14.7 million in 2005. Stock based compensation expense increased due to our implementation of FAS 123(R) at the beginning of 2006. General and administrative expenses increased in total and remained consistent as a percentage of net revenues in 2005 as compared to the prior year. The dollar increase was due primarily to employee related and facilities costs. Employee related costs increased by approximately $111.3 million during 2005 as compared to the prior year. We increased our general and administrative employees from approximately 2,700 at December 31, 2004 to approximately 4,200 at December 31, 2005. This increase related primarily to the addition of employees in our trust and safety and corporate functions. Facilities costs increased by approximately $48.2 million during 2005 as compared to the prior year. PayPals transaction loss expense increased by approximately $23.3 million, to $73.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, reflecting the increase in activity in the Payments segment in addition to the expansion of our PayPal Buyer Protection Program. PayPals transaction loss expense rate, which is the transaction loss expense as a percentage of PayPals total payment volume, was constant at 0.27% in 2005 and 2004. With our continued investment across all areas of our business and related corporate functions, particularly in our consumer protection programs, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase during 2007, but decrease as a percentage of net revenues as general and administrative expenses are expected to grow slower than net revenues. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets 2004 2005 2006 (In thousands, except percentages) Amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 65,927 $ 128,941 $ 197,078 As a percentage of net revenues 2.0 % 2.8 % 3.3 % From time to time we have purchased, and we expect to continue purchasing, assets or businesses to accelerate category and geographic expansion, increase the features, functions, and formats available to our users and maintain a leading role in online e commerce, payments and communications. These purchase transactions generally result in the creation of acquired intangible assets with finite lives and lead to a corresponding increase in the amortization expense in future periods. We amortize intangible assets over the period of estimated benefit, using the straight line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one to eight years. The increase in amortization of acquired amortizable intangibles during 2006 and 2005 compared to prior years is due to the business acquisitions consummated during 2006, 2005 and 2004. Amortization of acquired intangible assets may increase should we make additional acquisitions in the future. Interest and Other Income, Net 2004 2005 2006 (In thousands, except percentages) Interest and other income, net $ 77,867 $ 111,148 $ 130,021 As a percentage of net revenues 2.4 % 2.4 % 2.2 % Interest and other income, net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments as well as foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and other non operating transactions. Our interest and other income, net increased in total and remained relatively constant as a percentage of net revenues during 2006 as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of increased interest income due to increased cash, cash equivalents and investments balances and higher interest rates offset by the lower cash balances 52 Table of Contents due to our stock repurchase activity in 2006. The weighted average interest rate of our portfolio increased to 3.8% in 2006 from 2.9% in 2005. Our interest and other income, net increased in total and remained consistent as a percentage of net revenues during 2005 as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of increased interest income due to increased cash, cash equivalents and investments balances and higher interest rates. The weighted average interest rate of our portfolio increased to 2.9% in 2005 from 1.7% in 2004. We expect that interest and other income, net, will decline slightly during 2007 compared to 2006, as a result of lower cash balances due to our stock repurchase program. Our expectation for interest and other income, net, for 2007 excludes the potential effects from any future acquisitions we may make. Interest Expense 2004 2005 2006 (In thousands, except percentages) Interest expense $ 8,879 $ 3,478 $ 5,916 As a percentage of net revenues 0.3 % 0.1 % 0.1 % Interest expense consists of interest charges on tax contingencies, legal accruals, capital leases and our consolidated lease arrangement related to our San Jose headquarters office facilities. In 2007, interest expense may be impacted by our decision to utilize our line of credit. See additional discussion of our line of credit in Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Provision for Income Taxes 2004 2005 2006 (In thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 343,885 $ 467,285 $ 421,418 As a percentage of net revenues 10.5 % 10.3 % 7.1 % Effective tax rate 30 % 30 % 27 % The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory U.S. federal rate principally due to state taxes, subsidiary losses for which we have not provided a benefit and other factors that increase the effective tax rate, offset by decreases resulting from foreign income with lower effective tax rates and tax credits. The lower effective tax rates in 2006 as compared to 2005 and 2004 resulted primarily from the expansion of our international businesses and from changes in our operations in international markets. We expect the effective tax rate for 2007 to be consistent with 2006. Impact of Foreign Currency Translation During 2006, 2005 and 2004, our international net revenues, based upon the country in which the seller, payment recipient, Skype users Internet protocol address, advertiser or other service provider is located, accounted for approximately 48%, 46% and 42%, of our consolidated net revenues, respectively. The growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Net revenues and related expenses generated from most international locations are denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries, and primarily include Euros, British pounds, Korean won, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Chinese renminbi, and Indian rupees. Our results of operations and certain of our inter company balances associated with our international locations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The statements of income of our international operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased consolidated net revenues, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our net revenues, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies. 53 Table of Contents Net revenues were positively impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately $40.1 million in 2006 and $12.0 million in 2005 as compared to the same periods of the prior year. Operating income was positively impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately $14.4 million in 2006 and $5.6 million in 2005, as compared to the same periods of the prior year. We expect our international operations will continue to grow in significance. As a result, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in future periods could become more significant and may have a negative impact on our consolidated net revenues and net income in the event the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies. See the information in Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk under the caption Foreign Currency Risk for additional discussion of the impact of foreign currency translation and related hedging activities. Foreign Currency Exposures We are a rapidly growing company, with an increasing proportion of our operations outside the United States. Accordingly, our foreign currency exposures have increased substantially and are expected to continue to grow. The objective of our foreign exchange exposure management program is to identify material foreign currency exposures and to manage these exposures to minimize the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flow and results of operations. Our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction, economic and translation: Transaction Exposure: Around the world, we have certain assets and liabilities, primarily receivables, investments and accounts payable (including inter company transactions) that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional currency. In certain circumstances, changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other instruments to minimize the short term foreign currency fluctuations on such assets and liabilities. The gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset the transaction gains and losses on certain foreign currency receivables, investments and payables recognized in earnings. Economic Exposure: We also have anticipated future cash flows, including revenues and expenses, denominated in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional currency. Our primary economic exposures include future royalty receivables, customer collections, and vendor payments. Changes in the relevant entitys functional currency value will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge the value of a portion of these cash flows. We account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the transaction is settled. Earnings Translation Exposure: As our international operations grow, fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign denominated subsidiaries. We may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset the earnings impact of currency fluctuations. Such contracts will be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss will be recorded in interest and other income, net. Employee Stock Based Incentive Plans We continue to believe that employee stock based incentive plans represent an appropriate and essential component of our overall compensation program. We grant stock based awards to substantially all employees and believe that this broad based program helps us to attract, motivate, and retain high quality employees, to the ultimate benefit of our stockholders. We granted a limited number of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards to employees during 2006. Stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, net of cancellations/forfeitures, represented less than 2% of our total common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. A substantial portion of our stock based awards granted during the year were granted to existing employees. 54 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In thousands) Consolidated Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,285,315 $ 2,009,891 $ 2,247,791 Investing activities (2,013,220 ) (2,452,731 ) 228,853 Financing activities 647,669 471,606 (1,260,687 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 28,768 (45,231 ) 133,255 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (51,468 ) $ (16,465 ) $ 1,349,212 We have generated annual cash provided by operating activities in amounts greater than net income in 2006, 2005 and 2004 due primarily to non cash charges to earnings and the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options. Non cash charges to earnings included stock based compensation, depreciation and amortization on our long term assets, provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits resulting from increasing revenues and the provision for transaction losses related to PayPal. Prior to adopting FAS 123(R), we presented all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows. FAS 123(R) requires cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits to be classified as a part of cash flows from financing activities. Excess tax benefits represent tax benefits related to exercised options in excess of the associated deferred tax asset for such options. As a result of adopting FAS 123(R), $92.4 million of excess tax benefits for 2006 have been reported as a cash inflow from financing activities. In addition, as a substantial portion of the companys net operating losses and carryforward credits have now been utilized, cash will be required for tax payments in the U.S. going forward. Total U.S. and foreign income tax payments will be dependent on our taxable income and are estimated to be in the range of $650 $700 million in 2007. In 2007, we expect operating cash flows to increase, primarily driven by higher net income. The net cash provided by investing activities in 2006 was primarily due to the movement of investments to cash and cash equivalents to fund our stock repurchase program. The net cash used in investing activities in 2005 and 2004 reflected primarily the movement of cash and cash equivalents between cash and cash equivalents and investments, the purchase of property and equipment, and acquisitions. Purchases of property and equipment, net totaled $515.4 million in 2006, $338.3 million in 2005, and $292.8 million in 2004. Purchases of property and equipment in 2006, 2005 and 2004 related mainly to purchases of computer equipment and software to support our site operations, customer support and international expansion. Cash expended for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, totaled approximately $45.5 million in 2006, $2.7 billion in 2005, and $1.0 billion in 2004. In 2006, net cash payments for acquisitions consisted of the cash payment, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Tradera.com. In 2005, net cash payments for acquisitions consisted primarily of the cash payment, net of cash acquired for the acquisition of Rent.com, certain international classifieds websites, Shopping.com, Skype and the payment gateway business acquired from VeriSign. In 2004, our cash acquisitions included the acquisition of mobile.de, Baazee.com, and Marktplaats.nl, as well as an additional ownership interest in Internet Auction Co. In 2007, we expect to continue to purchase property and equipment and we may acquire businesses with cash that would impact investing cash flows. The net cash flows used in financing activities of $1.3 billion in 2006 was primarily due to the repurchase of approximately 54.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion, offset by the proceeds from stock options totaling $313.5 million. Prior to 2006, we had not repurchased our common stock under a stock repurchase program. The net cash flows provided by financing activities in 2005 and 2004 were due primarily to proceeds from stock option exercises. Proceeds from stock option exercises totaled $599.8 million in 2005 and $650.6 million in 2004. Our future cash flows from stock options are difficult to project 55 Table of Contents as such amounts are a function of our stock price, the number of options outstanding and the decisions by employees to exercise stock options. In general, we expect proceeds from stock option exercises to increase during periods in which our stock price has increased relative to historical levels. In July 2006, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of the companys common stock within two years from the date of authorization. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 54.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $30.56 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.7 billion. As of December 31, 2006, $0.3 billion remained available for further purchases under this program. In January 2007, our Board authorized, and the Company announced, an expansion of the stock repurchase program to provide for the repurchase of up to an additional $2.0 billion of our common stock over the next two years. Share repurchases under our repurchase program may take a variety of forms, including structured stock repurchase programs and other derivative transactions. We expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in 2007, thereby impacting financing cash flows. The positive effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2006 and 2004 was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. The negative effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2005 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. In November 2006, we entered into a credit agreement which provides for an unsecured $1 billion five year revolving credit facility. Loans under the credit agreement will bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.25 percent to 0.45 percent or (ii) a formula based on the prime rate or on the federal funds effective rate. Subject to certain conditions stated in the credit agreement, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the credit facility at any time during the term of the credit agreement. Funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we borrowed against the line of credit in the amount of $160 million. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents and investments of approximately $3.5 billion, together with cash generated from operations and cash available through the existing credit agreement, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures, stock repurchases and other obligations for the foreseeable future. Commitments and Contingencies We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables, in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments (in thousands): Operating Purchase Payments Due By Year Ending December 31, Leases Obligations Total 2007 $ 44,178 $ 180,633 $ 224,811 2008 41,536 64,908 106,444 2009 35,637 29,436 65,073 2010 29,476 16,396 45,872 2011 25,420 19,347 44,767 Thereafter 102,094 102,094 $ 278,341 $ 310,720 $ 589,061 Operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non cancelable operating leases for office facilities, as well as limited computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to exit an office facility early or expand our occupied space. 56 Table of Contents Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, software applications, engineering development services, construction contracts) and other goods and services that were entered into through our ordinary course of business. For those contractual arrangements in which there are significant performance requirements, we have developed estimates to project expected payment obligations. These estimates have been developed based upon historical trends, when available, and our anticipated future obligations. Given the significance of such performance requirements within our advertising and other arrangements, actual payments could differ significantly from these estimates. In conjunction with our Skype acquisition, we have certain earn out payment commitments, not included in table above, that are contingent upon Skype achieving certain net revenues, gross profit margin based targets and active user targets. See Note 3 Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006, we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. All customer funds held by PayPal as an agent or custodian on behalf of our customers are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. These funds include funds held in the U.S. that are deposited in bank accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and funds that customers choose to invest in PayPals Money Market Fund totaling approximately $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Indemnification Provisions In the ordinary course of business we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application programming interface license agreements. Under these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by any third party with respect to domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement. In a limited number of agreements, we have provided an indemnity for other types of third party claims, substantially all of which are indemnities related to copyrights, trademarks, and patents. In our PayPal business, we have provided an indemnity to our payment processors in the event of certain third party claims or card association fines against the processor arising out of conduct by PayPal. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, no significant costs have been incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection with our indemnification provisions. Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates General The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical 57 Table of Contents accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this report. Provisions for Doubtful Accounts and Authorized Credits We are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and credits to sellers. Provisions for these items represent our estimate of actual losses and credits based on our historical experience, are monitored monthly, and are made at the time the related revenue is recognized. The provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to operating expense, while the authorized credits are recorded as a reduction of revenues. The following table illustrates the provision related to doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a percentage of net revenues for 2004, 2005, and 2006 (in thousands, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 Net revenues $ 3,271,309 $ 4,552,401 $ 5,969,741 Provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits $ 90,942 $ 89,499 $ 100,729 Provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a % of net revenues 2.78 % 1.97 % 1.69 % Historically, our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions. However, future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of income and cash flows. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2006, a 25 basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income of approximately $14.9 million. The following analysis demonstrates, for illustrative purposes only, the potential effect a 25 basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands, except per share data): 25 Basis +25 Basis Points 2006 Points Provision for doubtful accounts and related authorized credits $ 85,805 $ 100,729 $ 115,653 Income from operations 1,437,880 1,422,956 1,408,032 Net income 1,140,563 1,125,639 1,110,715 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.80 $ 0.79 $ 0.78 Provision for Transaction Losses Our Payments segment is exposed to transaction losses due to credit card and other payment misuse, as well as non performance of sellers who accept payment through PayPal. We establish allowances for estimated losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as charge backs for unauthorized credit card use and merchant related charge backs due to non delivery of goods or services, Automated Clearing House, or ACH, returns, buyer protection program claims and debit card overdrafts. These allowances represent an accumulation of the estimated amounts necessary to provide for transaction losses incurred as of the reporting date, including those of which we have not yet been notified. The allowances, which involve the use of actuarial techniques, are monitored monthly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors. The allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including our experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types. The provision for transaction losses is reflected as a general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income. At December 31, 2006, the allowance for transaction losses totaled $79.5 million and was included in other current assets and accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. 58 Table of Contents The following table illustrates the provision for transaction losses as a percentage of total payment volume from PayPal operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 (in thousands, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 Total payment volume $ 18,915,000 $ 27,485,000 $ 37,752,000 Transaction loss expense $ 50,459 $ 73,773 $ 126,439 As a % of total payment volume 0.27 % 0.27 % 0.33 % Determining appropriate allowances for transaction losses is an inherently uncertain process, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2006, a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our operating expenses of approximately $18.9 million. The following analysis demonstrates, for illustrative purposes only, the potential effect a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006, and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands, except per share data): 5 Basis +5 Basis Points 2006 Points Transaction loss expense $ 107,562 $ 126,439 $ 145,315 Income from operations 1,441,832 1,422,956 1,404,079 Net income 1,144,515 1,125,639 1,106,762 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.80 $ 0.79 $ 0.78 Legal Contingencies In connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events. From time to time, we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we do not expect this trend to change in the future. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in Item 3: Legal Proceedings and Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies Litigation and Other Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us, and we will defend ourselves vigorously. However, even if successful, our defense against certain actions will be costly and could divert our managements time. If the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims, we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business. Any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of all or any of our three businesses. Accounting for Income Taxes We are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon the taxable income and temporary differences for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws around the world and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities, including various accruals, allowances, depreciation and amortization. The tax effect of these temporary differences and the estimated tax benefit from our tax net operating losses are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2006, we had a valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses based on our assessment 59 Table of Contents that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our tax provision in our consolidated statement of income. Our U.S. businesses generate sufficient cash flow to fully fund their operating requirements, and we expect that profits earned outside the U.S. will be fully utilized to fund our continued international expansion. Accordingly, we have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on non U.S. subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2006, because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. In the event that our future international expansion plans change and such amounts are not reinvested indefinitely, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes partially offset by foreign tax credits. The following table illustrates the effective tax rates for 2004, 2005, and 2006 (in thousands, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 Provision for income taxes $ 343,885 $ 467,285 $ 421,418 As a % of income before income taxes 30 % 30 % 27 % Historically, these provisions have adequately provided for our actual income tax liabilities. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuations of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes or interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2006, a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately $15.5 million. The following analysis demonstrates, for illustrative purposes only, the potential effect such a one percentage point deviation change would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands, except per share data): 100 Basis +100 Basis Points 2006 Points Provision for income taxes $ 405,947 $ 421,418 $ 436,889 Income from operations 1,438,427 1,422,956 1,407,485 Net income 1,141,110 1,125,639 1,110,168 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.80 $ 0.79 $ 0.78 Advertising and Other Revenues A portion of our net revenues result from fees associated with advertising and other services. Net revenues from advertising are derived principally from the sale of online advertisements for cash and through barter arrangements. Other net revenues are derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide transaction services to eBay and PayPal users and interest earned from banks on certain PayPal customer account balances. Advertising and other net revenues, including barter transactions, totaled 3% of our consolidated net revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, and were primarily generated by our Marketplaces segment. Revenue from barter arrangements totaled $1.4 million in 2006, $6.7 million in 2005 and $13.3 million in 2004. Certain judgments are involved in the determination of the appropriate revenue recognition, including, but not limited to, the assessment and allocation of fair values in multiple element arrangements, the appropriateness of gross or net revenue recognition and, for barter transactions, the existence of comparable cash transactions to establish fair values. Our advertising and other net revenues may be affected by the financial condition of the parties with whom we have these relationships and by the success of online services and promotions in general. Unlike our transaction revenues, advertising and other net revenues are derived from a relatively concentrated customer base. 60 Table of Contents Goodwill and Intangible Assets The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital. At December 31, 2006 our goodwill totaled $6.5 billion and our identifiable intangible assets totaled $683.0 million. We assess the impairment of goodwill of our reportable units annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. This assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization. The estimate of cash flow is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management. Our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to its business model or changes in operating performance. Additionally, certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increase the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance. Significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of August 31, 2006 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill for any of our reportable units was required. We have determined that no events or circumstances from that date through December 31, 2006 indicate that a further assessment was necessary. There was no impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, we adopted FAS 123(R), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases based on estimated fair values. Stock based compensation expense recognized for 2006 was $317.4 million, which consisted of stock based compensation expense related to stock options and employee stock purchases. For 2005 and 2004, stock based compensation expense of $31.8 million and $5.8 million, respectively, was recognized under previous accounting standards. See Note 12 Stock Based Plans to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information. We calculated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. The use of a Black Scholes model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of complex assumptions including expected life, expected volatility, risk free interest rate and dividend yield. The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during 2006 was $10.47 per share, using the Black Scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions: Risk free interest rates 4.7% Expected life 3 years Dividend yield 0% Expected volatility 36% Our computation of expected volatility for 2006 was based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility from traded options on our stock. Prior to 2006, our computation of expected volatility was based on historical volatility. Our computation of expected life was determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 61 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which is a change in accounting for income taxes. Among other provisions, FIN 48: specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized, measured, and derecognized in financial statements; requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters; specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the balance sheet; and provides transition and interim period guidance. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and as a result, is effective for us in the first quarter of 2007. We have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The changes to current practice resulting from the application of this statement relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. We will be required to adopt the provisions on FAS 157 beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2007. We do not believe that the adoption of the provisions of FAS 157 will materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Effective December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R), (FAS 158). These provisions did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements. FAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity. This statement also requires plan assets and obligations to be measured as of the employers balance sheet date. The measurement provision of this statement will be effective for years beginning after December 15, 2008 with early adoption encouraged. We have not yet adopted the measurement date provisions of this statement. In 2006, we adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108), which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The adoption of SAB 108 did not impact our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities, including government and corporate securities and money market funds. These securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of estimated tax. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk. The fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. In general, securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed rate securities, floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease. Due in part to these factors, our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2006, our fixed income investments earned a pretax yield of approximately 4.7%, with a weighted average maturity of two months. If interest rates were to instantaneously increase (decrease) by 100 basis points, the fair market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease (increase) by approximately $1.3 million. 62 Table of Contents Equity Price Risk We are exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of equity instruments and equity method investments we hold, typically as the result of strategic investments in third parties that are subject to considerable market risk due to their volatility. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure in these equity investments. We did not record an impairment charge during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 or 2004 relating to the other than temporary impairment in the fair value of equity investments. At December 31, 2006, the total carrying value of our equity instruments and equity method investments was $65.5 million. Foreign Currency Risk International net revenues result from transactions by our foreign operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country. These operations also incur most of their expenses in the local currency. Accordingly, certain foreign operations use the local currency, which is primarily the Euro, and to a lesser extent, the British pound, as their functional currency. Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors. In addition, at December 31, 2006, we held balances in cash, cash equivalents and investments outside the U.S. totaling approximately $2.3 billion. Transaction Exposure As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding forward foreign exchange hedge contracts with notional values equivalent to approximately $188.4 million with maturity dates within 31 days. The hedge contracts are used to offset changes in the functional currency value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as a result of currency fluctuations. Transaction gains and losses on the contracts and the assets and liabilities are recognized each period in our consolidated statement of income. Translation Exposure Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet. The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position for the year ended December 31, 2006, was a net translation gain of approximately $588.2 million. This gain is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of income. We consolidate the earnings of our international subsidiaries by converting them into U.S. dollars in accordance with SFAS No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation (FAS 52). Such earnings will fluctuate when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency denominated earnings translation exposure using either forward exchange contracts or other instruments. All contracts that hedge translation exposure mature ratably over the quarter in which they are executed. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the realized gains and losses related to these hedges were not significant. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening or weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro, British pound and Korean won in which our revenues and profits are denominated would result in a decrease/increase to operating income of approximately $110 million. There are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise, which may positively or negatively affect income. 63 Table of Contents Economic Exposure We currently charge our international subsidiaries on a monthly basis for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services provided by eBay and PayPal. These charges are denominated in Euros and these forecasted inter company transactions represent a foreign currency cash flow exposure. To reduce foreign exchange risk relating to these forecasted inter company transactions, we entered into forward exchange contracts or other instruments during the year ended December 31, 2006. The objective of the forward contracts is to ensure that the U.S. dollar equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the U.S. dollar/Euro exchange rate. Pursuant to SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133), we expect the hedge of certain of these forecasted transactions using the forward contracts to be highly effective in offsetting potential changes in cash flows attributed to a change in the U.S. dollar/Euro exchange rate. Accordingly, we record as a component of other comprehensive income all unrealized gains and losses related to the forward contracts that receive hedge accounting treatment. We record all unrealized gains and losses in interest and accumulated other income, net, related to the forward contracts that do not receive hedge accounting treatment pursuant to FAS 133. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, the realized gains and losses related to these hedges were not significant. The notional amount of our economic hedges receiving hedge accounting treatment and the losses, net of gains, recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2004 was $140.2 million and $3.4 million, respectively. The notional amount of our economic hedges receiving hedge accounting treatment and the loss, net of gains, recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2005 was $203.0 million and $200,000 respectively. We did not have any economic hedges in place as of December 31, 2006.
