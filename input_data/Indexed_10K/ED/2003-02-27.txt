ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED EDISON, INC. This discussion and analysis relates to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. Except where noted, this discussion and analysis is presented on a consolidated basis. Information in the notes referred to in this discussion and analysis is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as "see" or "refer to" shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made. CON EDISON Con Edison is a holding company that provides a wide range of energy related and telecommunications services to its customers through its regulated and unregulated subsidiaries. Con Edisons core business is energy distribution and it is also pursuing related growth opportunities in competitive businesses. Con Edisons principal subsidiary is Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York), a regulated utility that provides electric service to over 3.1 million customers and gas service to approximately 1.1 million customers in New York City and Westchester County. It also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R) is also a regulated utility subsidiary of Con Edison. O&R, along with its regulated utility subsidiaries, provides electric service to over 285,000 customers in southeastern New York and adjacent sections of New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania and gas service to over 120,000 customers in southeastern New York and northeastern Pennsylvania. Con Edison has four unregulated subsidiaries: Consolidated Edison Solutions, Inc. (Con Edison Solutions), a retail energy services company that sells electricity, gas and energy related services to delivery customers of utilities, including Con Edison of New York and O&R; Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc. (Con Edison Energy), a wholesale energy supply company; Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. (Con Edison Development), a company that owns and operates generating plants and energy and other infrastructure projects; and Con Edison Communications, LLC (Con Edison Communications), a company that builds and operates fiber optic networks to provide telecommunications services. The unregulated subsidiaries participate in competitive businesses that are subject to different risks than those found in the businesses of the regulated utility subsidiaries. The unregulated subsidiaries accounted for 7.3 percent of consolidated operating revenues and 2.9 percent of consolidated net income in 2002 (before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles) and 7.0 percent of consolidated total assets at December 31, 2002. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY Con Edisons earnings per share in 2002 were $3.03 ($3.02 on a diluted basis). Earnings per share in 2001 and 2000 were $3.22 ($3.21 on a diluted basis) and $2.75 ($2.74 on a diluted basis), respectively. Earnings per share for 2002, before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $22.1 million after tax, were $3.14 ($3.13 on a diluted basis). See Notes K and O to the financial statements. 36 Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were as follows: 2002 2001 2000 (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison of New York $ 605.4 $ 649.5 $ 570.1 * O&R 44.9 40.2 39.1 Unregulated subsidiaries (2.6 )** 11.5 7.7 Other*** (1.7 ) (19.0 ) (34.1 ) CON EDISON $ 646.0 $ 682.2 $ 582.8 *Includes a pre tax charge for the possible disallowance of $130 million of replacement power expenses. **Includes charges for the cumulative effect of two changes in accounting principles totaling $22.1 million after tax. ***Includes parent company expenses, inter company eliminations, goodwill amortization (in the years 2001 and 2000) and a $32.1 million charge in 2000 for merger related expenses.

The companys critical accounting policies include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utility subsidiaries and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases. The application of certain of these accounting policies requires the company to use estimates. These estimates may require the company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and for which different estimates that could reasonably have been used could have resulted in material differences in its financial statements. The major critical accounting policies are as follows: Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities SFAS No. 71 Con Edisons principal subsidiaries, Con Edison of New York and O&R, are regulated public utilities subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, are subject to the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction. SFAS No. 71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under SFAS No. 71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under SFAS No. 71. Con Edisons principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed on the companys consolidated balance sheet. The company is receiving or being credited with a return on all of its regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The company is paying or being charged with a return on all of its regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The companys regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Con Edison provides pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and retirees of its utility subsidiaries and certain employees of its unregulated subsidiaries. Con Edison accounts for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions." In applying these accounting policies, the company has made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, future compensation, health care cost trends, and appropriate discount rates. See Notes D and E to the financial statements for information about 38 these assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2002, 2001 and 2000. Primarily because of the amortization of previous years net investment gains, Con Edisons pension expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was negative, resulting in a credit to and increase in net income in each year. Investment gains and losses on plan assets are fully recognized in expense over a 15 year period (20 percent of the gains and losses for each year begin to amortize in each of the following five years and the amortization period for each 20 percent portion of the gains and losses is ten years). This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) and is permitted under SFAS No. 87, which provides a "corridor method" for moderating the effect of investment gains and losses on pension expense, or alternatively, allows for any systematic method of amortization of unrecognized gains and losses that is faster than the corridor method and is applied consistently to both gains and losses. Con Edisons expense or credit for actual pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend upon actual returns on plan assets and the assumptions the company makes for future periods. The companys current estimate for 2003 is a reduction, compared to 2002, in the pension and other postretirement benefits net credit of $54 million after tax. This reduction reflects, among other factors, an actual loss on the pension fund of 8.6 percent in 2002 as compared with an expected annual asset return assumption of 9.2 percent. This variation will reduce net income by $21.3 million after tax in 2003, as compared to 2002. In addition, the company has lowered its expected annual asset return assumption for the plans for 2003 to 8.8 percent. This revised assumption will reduce net income by $14.5 million after tax in 2003, as compared to 2002. Amortization of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to reduce the pension and other post retirement benefit net credit by an additional $25 million, after tax, in 2004. A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2003 as compared to the expected annual asset return of 8.8 percent would change net income by approximately $6 million in 2004. Under the terms of its current regulatory agreements, O&R would defer as a regulatory asset any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No. 87 and the amounts reflected in rates for such expenses. An actuarial valuation of the plans funded status was performed as of December 31, 2002. The valuation showed that the fair value of the companys pension plan assets exceeded its Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) at December 31, 2002. However, the fair market value of Con Edisons pension plan assets could fall below the plans ABO in future years. In that event, Con Edison would be required, under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 132 "Employers Disclosures about Pension and Postretirement Benefits," to accrue a liability equal in amount to the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the ABO, plus its total accrued pension credits, through a non cash charge to other comprehensive income (OCI). The charge to OCI, which would be net of taxes, would not affect the companys net income for common stock. Con Edison was not required to make cash contributions to its pension plan in 2002 nor will it be required to do so in 2003. 39 Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," applies to an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Con Edisons known material contingencies include litigation relating to its October 1999 merger agreement with Northeast Utilities, a proceeding relating to outages at the nuclear generating unit the company sold in 2001, workers compensation claims, and its responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, that have been used or generated in the course of the operations of its subsidiaries. See Notes F, G and P to the financial statements. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, the company has accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated. Accounting For Derivative Instruments Con Edisons subsidiaries use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase or sale of electricity or gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See "Financial Market Risks" below and Note O to the financial statements. Accounting for Goodwill Con Edison adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. In accordance with this standard, Con Edison ceased amortizing goodwill and began testing remaining goodwill balances for impairment on an annual basis. Con Edison completed initial goodwill impairment tests and recorded a loss of $34.1 million ($20.2 million after tax) as of January 1, 2002, relating to certain generation assets owned by an unregulated subsidiary. The unamortized goodwill of $405.8 million, relating to the acquisition of O&R, was tested for impairment and determined not to be impaired. See Note K to the financial statements. In determining whether or not its goodwill is impaired, Con Edison is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that could affect the results of the goodwill impairment test. Actual results could differ from the estimates used. Accounting for Leases Con Edison applies SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases" and other related accounting pronouncements to its leasing transactions. See Notes J and S to the financial statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Con Edisons liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows and discussed below. As a result of these activities, cash and temporary cash investments (including restricted cash) decreased $226.9 million at December 31, 2002 compared to December 31, 2001. Cash Flows From Operating Activities Con Edisons cash flows from operating activities reflect principally its energy sales and its cost of operations. The volume of energy sales is dependent on factors external to Con Edison such as weather, economic conditions and technological developments. The prices at which Con Edisons utility subsidiaries provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with rate agreements approved by 40 the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC), the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC). See "Regulatory Matters" below. In general, changes in the utility subsidiaries cost of purchased power, fuel and gas affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate agreements. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Net income for common stock is the result of cash and non cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect Con Edisons cash flow from operations. Principal non cash charges include depreciation and deferred taxes. Principal non cash credits include accrued pension credits. Pension credits result from past favorable performance in Con Edison of New Yorks pension fund and assumptions about future performance. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits" and Notes D and E to the financial statements. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2002 were $82.6 million less than the 2001 period. This decrease is due principally to higher energy costs and sales in December 2002 as compared to December 2001, resulting in increased customer accounts receivable and recoverable energy costs, offset in part by increased accounts payable balances. The net benefit to cash flow from these activities in 2001 was greater than the benefit in 2002 because high energy costs at year end 2000 were collected in 2001 and energy purchases at year end 2001 were lower than the prior year. The change in cash flows also reflect the timing of federal income tax payments and refunds and net cash received related to regulatory liabilities, such as transmission congestion contracts, offset by increased cash expended related to regulatory assets. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2001 increased $245.5 million compared with 2000, due principally to lower energy costs which are reflected in decreased customer accounts receivable and recoverable energy costs, offset in part by decreased accounts payable balances. See Note G to the financial statements. The following analysis reflects variations in balance sheet accounts, which impact specific line items within the consolidated statement of cash flows. The changes in these balance sheet line items are utilized to reconcile income to cash flow from operations. Accounts receivable customers, less allowance for uncollectible accounts were $96.4 million higher at December 31, 2002 than at year end 2001, due primarily to higher electric, gas and steam sales in December 2002 as compared to December 2001. Con Edison of New Yorks equivalent number of days of revenue outstanding (ENDRO) of customer accounts receivable was 29.3 days at December 31, 2002, compared with 29.6 days at December 31, 2001. For O&R, the ENDRO was 23.0 days at December 31, 2002, compared with 23.6 days at year end 2001. Recoverable energy costs increased $113.0 million at December 31, 2002 as compared with year end 2001 due primarily to increased fuel, purchased power and gas costs, resulting from higher sales volumes in December 2002. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Other receivables increased $70.0 million at December 31, 2002 as compared with year end 2001, due primarily to increased receivables associated with electric and gas commodity transactions at the unregulated subsidiaries (accounts payable for such transactions also increased) and increased gas hedging 41 program receivables at the utility subsidiaries. See "Financial Market Risks Commodity Price Risks," below. Gas in storage decreased $31.0 million at December 31, 2002 as compared with year end 2001, reflecting primarily the lower volumes in storage as a result of higher withdrawals due to the colder weather at year end 2002 as compared to 2001. Other current assets increased $18.9 million at December 31, 2002 compared with year end 2001, due primarily to an increase in the value of energy marketing contracts at the regulated and unregulated subsidiaries. Deferred loss on the sale of the nuclear generating unit decreased $47.6 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 reflecting the recovery of these costs from Con Edison of New Yorks customers in accordance with the companys 2000 Electric Rate Agreement. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. Divestiture capacity replacement reconciliation balance decreased $30.0 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 representing the amortization of capacity costs incurred prior to the opening of the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) market, in accordance with the companys 2000 Electric Rate Agreement. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. Deferred environmental remediation costs increased $20.5 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 representing primarily additional liabilities accrued for costs related to Superfund and other sites, which Con Edisons regulated subsidiaries are permitted to recover under current rate agreements. See Note F to the financial statements. For information about the regulatory asset for World Trade Center restoration costs, see Note Q to the financial statements. Deferred asbestos related costs increased $33.7 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 due to increased liabilities accrued for Con Edison of New Yorks non employee related asbestos claims (which Con Edison of New York is permitted to recover under its current rate agreements). See Note F to the financial statements. Other regulatory assets increased $34.4 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 due principally to the reconciliation of taxes collected and the tax expense resulting from New York State tax law changes in accordance with PSC authorization. See Note A to the financial statements and "Other Regulatory Liabilities," below. Accumulated provision for injuries and damages increased $21.8 million at December 31, 2002 as compared with year end 2001, reflecting primarily workers compensation claims relating to asbestos exposure. See Note F to the financial statements. Accounts payable increased $239.7 million at December 31, 2002 as compared with year end 2001. This increase is due primarily to higher electric, gas and steam energy costs at December 31, 2002 as compared to December 31, 2001, reflecting higher sales volumes, and an increase in payables associated with settled 42 electric and gas commodity transactions at the unregulated subsidiaries. See discussion of electric power costs in "Results of Operations," below. Accrued taxes decreased $45.3 million at December 31, 2002 compared with year end 2001, due primarily to the payment of the 2001 fourth quarter federal income tax liability in January 2002. The federal government delayed the timing of the payment in light of the World Trade Center attack. Transmission congestion contracts increased $119.9 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 reflecting proceeds from the sale of transmission rights on Con Edison of New Yorks transmission system. These proceeds are being retained for customer benefit. The gas rate plan balance of $36.3 million at December 31, 2002 was established in accordance with the 2002 gas rate agreement to provide for the recovery of costs (net of reimbursement) related to the World Trade Center attack. Electric excess earnings balance of $40.0 million at December 31, 2002 represents a reserve established in 2002 for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return that are to be retained for customer benefit in accordance with Con Edison of New Yorks 2000 Electric Rate Agreement. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. During 2002, other regulatory liabilities increased $125.5 million, due primarily to the reconciliation of taxes collected and the expense resulting from New York State tax law changes in accordance with PSC authorization and the establishment of a liability to customers for interest earned on a federal income tax refund. Changes in the New York State tax laws applicable to utility companies, effective January 1, 2000, repealed or reduced certain revenue based taxes and instituted a net income based tax. In June 2001, the PSC issued its final Order relating to these tax law changes. It authorized each utility to use deferral accounting to record the difference between taxes being collected and tax expense resulting from tax law changes, until those changes are incorporated into base rates. Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities were $686.8 million higher in 2002 compared with 2001, due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from generation divestiture, net of contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust, in the 2001 period. See "Generation Divestiture," below. In addition, construction expenditures increased $112.3 million in 2002 compared with 2001, principally to meet load growth on the companys electric distribution systems, to effect permanent restoration of portions of the electric, gas and steam systems in lower Manhattan following the World Trade Center attack and for the ongoing project to add incremental generating capacity at Con Edison of New Yorks East River steam electric generating plant (the East River Repowering Project). Cash flows used in investing activities in 2001 decreased $605.5 million compared with 2000, due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from generation divestiture, which offset increased utility construction expenditures related to meet load growth on the companys electric distribution systems. See "Generation Divestiture" and "Capital Expenditures" below. Deferred real estate sale costs related to the demolition and remediation of a nine acre development site in midtown Manhattan along the East River were $134.4 million at December 31, 2002, compared to $105.4 million at December 31, 2001. In 2000, Con Edison of New York agreed to sell this site for an 43 expected price of $576 million to $680 million, depending on zoning and other adjustments. The sale is subject to PSC approval and other conditions. The buyer paid Con Edison of New York $50 million in 2000 as a down payment, which Con Edison of New York used to fund a portion of the demolition and remediation expenses. The down payment has been recorded as a regulatory liability. Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities Net cash flows used in financing activities in 2002 decreased $278.0 million compared with 2001, reflecting principally increased financing for construction expenditures at Con Edison of New York, the issuance of common stock and a reduction in the amount of common stock dividends paid in cash. In 2002, the company began issuing new common shares for its Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Payment Plan instead of purchasing previously issued shares on the open market (approximately 1.0 million shares for $39.6 million). In September 2001, the company used the proceeds from the sale of Con Edison of New Yorks nuclear plant to repay all outstanding short term borrowing. Net repayments of short term debt increased $221.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with 2001 period. Cash flows used in financing activities in 2001 increased $196.3 million compared with 2000, as a result of decreased borrowings and increased debt redemption. Con Edison had $161.7 million of commercial paper and other short term notes outstanding at December 31, 2002 and $343.7 million outstanding at December 31, 2001. Con Edisons average daily short term borrowing outstanding in 2002 was $256.1 million compared with $241.8 million in 2001. The weighted average interest rate was 1.7 percent in 2002 compared to 4.6 percent in 2001. For additional information about Con Edisons short term borrowing, see Note C to the financial statements. In February 2002, Con Edison of New York redeemed at maturity $150 million of 6.625 percent 9 year, Series 1993C Debentures. In April 2002, Con Edison issued $325 million of 7.25 percent long term debt (Public Income Notes, Series 2002A), with a 40 year maturity, callable at par after five years. In June 2002, Con Edison of New York redeemed at maturity $150 million of variable rate 5 year, Series 1997A Debentures and issued $300 million of non callable 5.625 percent 10 year Series 2002A Debentures. In August 2002, Con Edison of New York redeemed at maturity $37.1 million of Cumulative Preferred Stock, $100 par value, 6.125 percent, Series J. In December 2002, Con Edison of New York issued $500 million 4.875 percent 10 year Series 2002B Debentures. In January 2003, Con Edison of New York redeemed $275 million of 7.75 percent 35 year, Series 1996A, Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures. In October 2002, Con Edison of New York changed the interest rate method applicable to $224.6 million aggregate principal amount of its tax exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2001A from a variable weekly rate mode to a 10 year term mode, callable at par after three years with a 4.70 percent annual interest rate. In addition, Con Edison of New York entered into a swap agreement in connection with these bonds pursuant to which the company pays interest at a variable rate equal to the three month LIBOR and is paid interest at a fixed rate of 5.375 percent. See Note O to the financial statements. 44 External borrowings are a source of liquidity for Con Edison that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital markets. For information about Con Edisons ratings and certain financial ratios, see "Capital Resources" below. Generation Divestiture In 2001, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of its interest in the jointly owned Roseton generating station and its nuclear generating unit and related assets. See Note I to the financial statements. Capital Resources Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily from dividends it receives from its subsidiaries and through the sale of securities, including commercial paper. In addition, Con Edisons ability to make payments on its external borrowings and dividends on its common shares is dependent upon its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its interests in its subsidiaries. For information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by Con Edisons utility subsidiaries, see Note B to the financial statements. For information about Con Edisons $950 million commercial paper programs and revolving credit agreements with banks, see Note C to the financial statements. In 2002, Con Edison issued 1.7 million shares of previously unissued shares of its common stock for its Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Payment Plan, Stock Purchase Plan and Stock Option Plan, which increased common equity by $68.5 million. Con Edison expects its utility subsidiaries to finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally generated funds and external borrowings. In December 2001, the PSC authorized Con Edisons utility subsidiaries to issue up to $1.95 billion of debt securities prior to 2006, of which Con Edison of New York issued $525 million of debt securities in 2002. In addition, the PSC authorized the refunding of the utility subsidiaries outstanding debt securities and preferred stock. Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions from Con Edison, internally generated funds and external borrowings and off balance sheet financings guaranteed by Con Edison. See Note S to the financial statements. In August 2002, President Bush signed into law an appropriations bill that authorizes funds for which the company is eligible to apply for the recovery of costs it incurred in connection with the World Trade Center attack. The procedural guidelines for disbursement of the federal funds are in the process of being developed. See Note Q to the financial statements. Con Edisons ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 2002, 2001 and 2000 and common equity ratio at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were: 2002 2001 2000 Earnings to fixed charges (SEC basis) 3.25 3.49 3.10 Common equity ratio 48.2 49.6 49.1 45 Con Edisons ratio of earnings to fixed charges decreased for 2002 compared to 2001 primarily as a result of decreased earnings, including a non cash, after tax charge of $22.1 million related to changes in accounting principles. Excluding this charge, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 2002 would have been 3.3. See Notes K and O to the financial statements. Con Edisons ratio of earnings to fixed charges increased for 2001 compared to 2000 primarily as a result of increased earnings, reflecting charges in 2000 for replacement power costs ($130.0 million) and merger related expenses ($32.1 million). See Notes G and P to the financial statements. The commercial paper of Con Edison and its utility subsidiaries is rated P 1, A 1 and F 1, respectively, by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), Standard & Poors Rating Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Con Edisons unsecured debt is rated A2, A and A , respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. The senior unsecured debt of Con Edisons subsidiaries, Con Edison of New York and O&R, is rated A1, A+ and A+, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. Capital Requirements The following table compares Con Edisons capital requirements relating to its regulated and unregulated subsidiaries for the years 2000 through 2002 and estimated amounts for 2003 and 2004: 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Regulated utility construction expenditures $ 959 $ 1,043 $ 1,157 $ 1,179 $ 1,104 Investment in unregulated subsidiaries 121 187 277 134 47 Sub total 1,080 1,230 1,434 1,313 1,151 Retirement of long term securities at maturity 395 638 348 460 * 150 Total $ 1,475 $ 1,868 $ 1,782 $ 1,773 $ 1,301 *Includes redemption in advance of maturity of $275 million of Con Edison of New Yorks Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures Series 1996A in January 2003. The increased regulated utility construction expenditures in 2002 and 2003 reflect expenditures for permanent electric, gas and steam system restoration following the World Trade Center attack, programs to meet increased electric load growth and reliability needs, a higher level of gas infrastructure expenditures and the East River Repowering Project. The investment in unregulated subsidiaries reflects Con Edisons funding to the unregulated subsidiaries as well as the subsidiaries own investments, but does not include off balance sheet financing (which is guaranteed by Con Edison). See Notes R and S to the financial statements. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, Con Edisons investment in these subsidiaries, on an unconsolidated basis, was $789.8 million and $473.5 million, respectively. 46  Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes Con Edisons material obligations at December 31, 2002, to make payments pursuant to contracts. Long term debt and capital lease obligations are included on Con Edisons balance sheet. Operating leases and non utility generator (NUGs) contracts (for which undiscounted future annual payments are shown) are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long term debt (Note B) $ 6,668 $ 473 $ 627 $ 385 $ 5,183 Capital lease obligations (Note J) 72 8 15 14 35 Operating leases (Notes J and S) 418 79 129 88 122 Non utility generator contracts (Note H) 8,145 543 1,076 1,061 5,465 Natural gas supply, transportation and storage contracts 424 144 135 120 25 Total $ 15,727 $ 1,247 $ 1,982 $ 1,668 $ 10,830 Con Edisons material commercial commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments are its guarantees of certain obligations of its subsidiaries. See Notes R and S to the financial statements. ELECTRIC POWER REQUIREMENTS In 2002, Con Edisons utility subsidiaries purchased substantially all of the energy they sold to customers pursuant to firm contracts with NUGs and others or through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market. Con Edison expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2003. In general, Con Edisons utility subsidiaries recover prudently incurred purchase power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See "Financial Market Risks Commodity Price Risk" below and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. From time to time certain parties have petitioned the PSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on Con Edisons financial position, results of operations or liquidity. To reduce the volatility of electric energy costs, Con Edisons utility subsidiaries have firm contracts to purchase electric energy (including the output of the nuclear generating unit divested in 2001) and have entered into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of expected purchases, which together cover a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to customers in the summer of 2003. See Notes H and O to the financial statements. Con Edison of New York also owns approximately 630 MW of electric generating stations located in New York City, the electricity from which it sells through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market. In December 2002, Con Edison of New York issued a request for proposals seeking a contract to purchase, for no more than 10 years, 500 MW of electric capacity from a new facility located in New York City (or outside the City if there is dedicated new transmission). 47 The East River Repowering Project will add incremental electric capacity of approximately 200 MW based on a winter nominal rating or approximately 125 MW based on a summer nominal rating. Con Edisons utility subsidiaries do not expect to add any other long term electric generation resources. In a July 1998 order, the PSC indicated that it "agree(s) generally that Con Edison of New York need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops," but considers "overly broad" and did not adopt Con Edison of New Yorks request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, it will no longer be required to engage in long range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of capacity. Con Edison of New York monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO. Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries sell electricity in the wholesale and retail NYISO and other markets. At December 31, 2002, Con Edison Development owned interests in electric generating facilities with an aggregate capacity of 588 MW and had under construction additional generating facilities with an aggregate capacity of 665 MW of capacity. In addition, Con Edison Development has an operating lease arrangement for a 525 MW generating facility (see Notes J and S) that was placed in service in December 2002. Con Edison Energy sells the electricity from these generating facilities under contract or on the wholesale electricity markets. See "Financial Market Risks Commodity Price Risk," below. REGULATORY MATTERS Electric In July 2002, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) to establish a Standard Market Design (SMD) for wholesale electricity markets across the country. The proposed SMD has many of the elements of the markets that have been established in the Northeast, and if adopted, could facilitate transactions among energy markets across the country. The SMD proposes that transmission owners would join Independent Transmission Providers, or ITPs, which would be independent of market participants, would have operational authority for all transmission assets under their control, and would perform certain functions related to day ahead and real time energy markets, determine resource adequacy requirements, financial congestion management, regional planning, market monitoring, and interregional coordination with neighboring ITPs. Transmission facilities of Con Edisons utility subsidiaries, other than those located underground, are currently controlled by the NYISO. In September 1997, the PSC approved a restructuring agreement among Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties (the 1997 Restructuring Agreement). Pursuant to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, Con Edison of New York reduced electric rates on an annual basis by $129 million in 1998, $80 million in 1999, $103 million in 2000 and $209 million in 2001, divested most of its electric generating capacity, and enabled all of its electric customers to be served by competitive energy suppliers. 48 In November 2000, the PSC approved an October 2000 agreement (the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement) that, among other things, revised and extended the electric rate plan provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement and addressed certain generation divestiture related issues. The electric rate plan provisions of the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement cover the five year period ending March 2005. Pursuant to the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, Con Edison of New York reduced the distribution component of its electric rates by $170 million on an annual basis, effective October 2000. The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement continues the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers prudently incurred purchased power and fuel costs from customers. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. For additional information about the 1997 Restructuring Agreement and the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, see "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. O&R has entered into settlement agreements or similar arrangements with the PSC, NJBPU and PPUC that provide for a transition to a competitive electric market. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. In August 2002, O&Rs New Jersey utility subsidiary submitted a petition to the NJBPU requesting recovery under New Jerseys 1999 Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act (EDECA) of $110 million of electric purchased power costs in excess of amounts previously billed to customers, associated interest, and other deferred charges. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Gas In April 2002, the PSC approved a Con Edison of New York gas rate agreement for the three year period ending September 30, 2004. The rate agreement reduces retail sales and transportation rates by $25 million, on an annual basis. In November 2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties that revised and extended the 1996 gas rate settlement agreement through September 2001. The 1996 agreement, with limited exceptions, continued base rates at September 1996 levels through September 2000. In November 2000, the PSC also approved a gas rate agreement between O&R, PSC Staff and certain other parties covering the three year period November 2000 through October 2003. In November 2002, O&R filed a request with the PSC for approval of a $27.2 million rate increase effective November 2003. O&R also submitted a multi year plan that addresses rates for two additional years, with an increase of $2.5 million per year to cover adjustments to infrastructure costs, inflation and property taxes. The Administrative Law Judge is expected to issue a recommended decision in the third quarter 2003. For additional information about the new gas rate agreements, see "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. 49 Steam In December 2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties with respect to the steam rate plan filed by Con Edison in November 1999. The agreement provides for a $16.6 million steam rate increase, which took effect October 2000 and, with limited exceptions, provided for no further changes in steam rates prior to October 2004. For additional information about the agreement, see "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. FINANCIAL MARKET RISKS Con Edisons primary market risks are interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk. Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including utility construction expenditures and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2002, a 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt of $809.8 million would result in a change in annual interest expense of $1.2 million. In addition, Con Edison and its subsidiaries, from time to time, enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See "Interest Rate Hedging" in Note O to the financial statements. Commodity Price Risk Con Edisons commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The regulated and unregulated subsidiaries have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note O to the financial statements. In general, the rates the utility subsidiaries charge customers for electric, gas and steam service fluctuate with the cost of purchased power, gas purchased for resale and fuel used in the generation of steam and electricity, including gains or losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchases and related transaction costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2002, a 10 percent change in market prices would result in a change in fair value of $7.4 million for the derivative instruments used by its regulated utility subsidiaries to hedge purchases of electricity and gas. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries use a value at risk model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts, and commodity derivative instruments. Value at risk represents the potential change in the fair value of instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence 50 level. The unregulated subsidiaries estimate value at risk across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level. Since the value at risk calculation involves complex calculation methodologies, estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. The average, high and low values at risk for the 12 months ended December 31, 2002 were $1.4 million, $3.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Credit Risk Con Edison is exposed to credit risk related to over the counter transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities for its regulated and unregulated subsidiaries. Credit risk is the loss that may result from a counterpartys nonperformance. Con Edison uses credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, master netting agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements. Con Edison measures credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff. Con Edisons unregulated energy subsidiaries had $64.8 million of credit exposure, net of collateral, at December 31, 2002, of which $45.0 million was with investment grade counterparties and $14.2 million was with the New York Mercantile Exchange or independent system operators. Investment Risk Con Edisons investment risk relates to the investment of the assets in the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See "Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," above. ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES Unregulated subsidiaries of Con Edison engage in energy trading activities that are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. Con Edison Energy markets energy through specialized products and provides wholesale capacity, risk management and load forecasting and scheduling services to wholesale and retail energy providers and asset optimization services for the electric generating plants of Con Edison Development. Con Edison Energy also procures and markets energy for other Con Edison subsidiaries and utilizes commodity contracts such as two party forward contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity and capacity, over the counter swap contracts, exchange traded natural gas and crude oil futures and options, transmission congestion contracts, natural gas transportation contracts and other physical and financial contracts. Prior to October 2002, these contracts were accounted for under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." As of October 2002, energy and energy related trading contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for under SFAS No. 133. Such contracts are marked to market with gains and losses recognized in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, Con Edison recognized in income net unrealized pre tax losses of $1.4 million, excluding the effect of a cumulative adjustment 51 due to a change in accounting principle, and net gains of $9.6 million, respectively. Contracts that did not fall within the scope of SFAS No. 133 were included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle recognized in December 2002. See Note T to the financial statements. The changes in fair value of energy trading net assets for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Fair value of net assets outstanding beginning of period $ 11.2 $ 1.6 Change in fair value during the period: Unrealized gain at inception 10.9 Net premium paid/(received) (1.7 ) Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (3.2 ) Changes in fair value prior to settlement 6.4 (1.6 ) Fair value realized at settlement of contracts (18.7 ) 11.2 Total change in fair value during the period (6.3 ) 9.6 Fair value of net assets outstanding end of period $ 4.9 $ 11.2 As of December 31, 2002, the sources of fair value of the energy trading net assets were as follows: Fair Value of Net Assets at Period End (Millions of Dollars) Source of Fair Value Maturity less than 1 year Maturity 1 3 years Maturity 4 5 years Maturity in excess of 5 years Total fair value Prices provided by external sources $ 12.6 $ (4.8 ) $ $ $ 7.8 Prices based on models and other valuation methods (2.9 ) (2.9 ) Total $ 9.7 $ (4.8 ) $ $ $ 4.9 "Prices provided by external sources" represents the fair value of exchange traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources. "Prices based on models and other valuation methods" represents the fair value of positions calculated using internal models when directly and indirectly quoted external prices or prices derived from external sources are not available. Internal models incorporate the use of options pricing and estimates of the present value of cash flows based upon underlying contractual terms. The models reflect managements estimates, taking into account observable market prices, estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices, the risk free market discount rate, volatility factors, estimated correlations of energy commodity prices and contractual volumes. Counterparty specific credit quality, market price uncertainty and other risks are also factored into the models. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS For information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment, including the Superfund, and from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos, see Note F to the financial statements. 52 IMPACT OF INFLATION Con Edison is affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits Con Edisons utility subsidiaries to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the utility subsidiaries long term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Con Edisons results of operations (which were discussed above under "Results of Operations Summary") are discussed below for each of its business segments. Con Edisons principal business segments are its electric, gas and steam utility businesses of its regulated utility subsidiaries and the businesses of its unregulated subsidiaries. For additional information about its business segments, see Note N to the financial statements. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 Electric Con Edisons electric operating revenues in 2002 decreased $637.0 million compared with 2001, reflecting primarily lower fuel and purchased power costs of $297.1 million (discussed below). The decrease also reflects the completion in March 2002 of amortizations of a previously deferred gain on the sale of divested plants and a previously deferred NYPA revenue increase ($43.3 million), a reserve established in 2002 for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return that are to be retained for customer benefit in accordance with Con Edison of New Yorks 2000 Electric Rate Agreement ($40.0 million), the amortization of the loss ($29.9 million) related to the sale of the companys nuclear generating unit and rate reductions and other amortizations in accordance with the companys rate agreements. The decrease in electric operating revenues was offset, in part, by an increase in electric sales revenues ($24.0 million) reflecting principally the hot summer weather. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" and "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. Electricity delivery volumes for Con Edisons utility subsidiaries increased 2.0 percent in 2002 compared with 2001. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, electricity delivery volumes for Con Edison of New York and O&R increased 0.5 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively, in the 2002 period. Con Edisons electric purchased power costs decreased $244.8 million in 2002 compared with 2001, due to a decrease in the price of purchased power and an increase in volumes of electricity purchased from other suppliers by participants in the retail access programs of Con Edisons utility subsidiaries. This decrease was offset in part by Con Edison of New Yorks increased purchased volumes resulting from the sale of the companys nuclear generating unit in September 2001 and the hot summer weather in 2002. Fuel costs decreased $52.3 million as a result of decreased generation at Con Edison of New Yorks owned power plants. In general, Con Edisons utility subsidiaries recover prudently incurred fuel and 53 purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Con Edisons electric operating income decreased $85.4 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The principal component of the decrease was lower net electric revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $339.9 million. The decrease in net electric revenues reflects the sale of the nuclear generation unit and the same factors (other than lower fuel and purchased power costs) as discussed above with respect to the decrease in electric operating revenues. The decrease in net revenues was offset in part by reduced other operations and maintenance expenses ($135.0 million) reflecting nuclear production expenses incurred in 2001, but not in 2002 and productivity improvements, lower depreciation and amortization expense ($30.3 million) and lower revenue taxes ($27.2 million). The decrease is also offset by lower income tax of $63.9 million. Gas Con Edisons gas operating revenues decreased $261.9 million, resulting primarily from the lower cost of purchased gas ($233.9 million) in 2002 compared with 2001. The lower cost of purchased gas reflects primarily lower unit costs at Con Edison of New York. The lower revenues also reflect reduced sales volumes, resulting primarily from the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and for Con Edison of New York, revenue reductions implemented in accordance with the gas rate agreement approved by the PSC in April 2002. Gas operating income decreased $6.5 million in 2002, reflecting a $28.0 million decrease in net revenues (operating revenues less gas purchased for resale), and increased property tax expense ($10.0 million), offset in part by reduced operations and maintenance expenses ($16.6 million), reduced revenue taxes ($12.1 million) and lower income taxes ($7.8 million). Con Edisons gas sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 3.2 percent in the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, firm gas sales and transportation volumes for Con Edison of New York and O&R decreased 1.5 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively, in the 2002 period. Con Edisons gas sales and transportation volumes vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the winter. A weather normalization provision that applies to the gas business of Con Edisons utility subsidiaries moderates, but does not completely eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on gas operating income. Steam Con Edison of New Yorks steam operating revenues decreased $99.7 million. The lower revenues reflect reduced sales volumes and lower fuel and purchased power costs primarily as a result of the loss of the World Trade Center as a customer, the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002, and the soft economy. The lower fuel and purchased power costs reflect primarily lower unit costs. Steam operating income increased $8.2 million for 2002 compared with 2001 due primarily to reduced operations and maintenance expenses of $9.3 million and lower income taxes of $10.5 million, offset in part by a 54 decrease in net revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $11.1 million. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Steam sales volume decreased 3.2 percent in the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with the year ended December 31, 2001, reflecting primarily the loss of the World Trade Center as a customer, the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, steam sales volume decreased 1.4 percent. Unregulated Business Earnings for the unregulated subsidiaries decreased $14.0 million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting a non cash, after tax charge in 2002 of $22.1 million for changes in accounting principles (see Notes K, O and S to the financial statements) and continued start up losses in the companys wholesale telecommunications business, including a non cash, after tax charge in 2002 of $5.0 million for a write down of an investment in Neon Communications, Inc. (NEON). The decrease in earnings was offset, in part, by higher electric retail sales volumes and gross margins, the capitalization of previously expensed project development costs on generation assets ($4.2 million after tax) and unrealized mark to market gains on derivative instruments ($6.9 million after tax), which are also discussed below in "Other Income." Taxes Other Than Income Taxes At $1.1 billion, taxes other than income taxes remain one of Con Edisons largest operating expenses. The principal components of, and variations in, operating taxes were: Increase/(Decrease) 2002 Amount 2002 compared to 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Property taxes $ 660.6 $ 11.5 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 365.2 (38.1 ) Payroll taxes 60.1 (0.7 ) Other taxes 28.3 2.0 Total $ 1,114.2 * $ (25.3 ) *Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customers in 2002 were $1,463.7 million. Effective in 2003, New York City increased Con Edison of New Yorks annual property taxes by $96 million. Under Con Edison of New Yorks rate agreements, the company is deferring the property tax increase as a regulatory asset to be recovered from customers. Other Income Investment income decreased $6.1 million in 2002 compared to 2001, due principally to reduced interest income earned on short term cash investments in the 2002 period as compared to the 2001 period. For the 2001 period, the company had more cash on hand than the 2002 period, primarily as a result of the sale of its nuclear generating unit. Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $8.7 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily reflecting the East River Repowering Project. Other 55 income increased $52.5 million in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to $26.7 million of interest income on a federal income tax refund claim, a $10.2 million write off in 2001 of an investment in the New York Discovery Fund in 2001, a $9.4 million increase in interest earned on Con Edison of New Yorks regulatory assets (See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities SFAS No. 71," above) and a $11.7 million mark to market gain on derivative contracts for an unregulated subsidiary. These increases were offset in part by reduced income of $2.5 million from Con Edison of New Yorks non utility operations. Other income deductions decreased $8.1 million due principally to lower legal fees relating to the Northeast Utilities litigation. See Note P to the financial statements. Net Interest Charges Net interest charges increased $10.7 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase reflects principally the interest expense associated with a net federal income tax deficiency related to a prior period audit ($19.1 million), partially offset by decreased interest expense on long term debt of $11.6 million. Income Tax Federal income tax decreased $11.8 million in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting lower income before tax and deductions related to removal costs and tax credits. In 2000, New York State implemented a tax law change that reduced or repealed certain revenue based taxes and replaced them with the imposition of a net income based tax. State income taxes decreased $54.4 million in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting lower income before tax, lowering of the tax rate and prior period adjustments. The state income tax expense is offset against the savings from the eliminated or reduced revenue taxes. Any over or under collection of these taxes is deferred for return to, or recovery from, customers. See Notes A and L to the financial statements. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 Electric Con Edisons electric operating revenues in 2001 decreased $50.3 million from 2000. The decrease in 2001 reflects decreased purchased power costs (see "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements) and electric rate reductions of $375.6 million in 2001, offset by the effects of the warmer than normal summer weather when compared to cooler than normal weather for the 2000 period. Electricity sales volume for Con Edisons utility subsidiaries increased 3.1 percent in 2001 compared with 2000. The increase reflects the warmer than normal summer weather and economic growth. Con Edisons electric sales vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the summer. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, in each period, electricity sales volume for Con Edison New York increased 2.4 percent in 2001 compared with 2000. For O&R, weather adjusted electric sales increased 3.3 percent in 2001 compared with 2000. Con Edisons electric operating income increased $93.2 million in 2001 compared with 2000. The increase reflects an increase in net revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power) of $73 million. The increase in net revenues reflects principally increased sales ($76.3 million), recognition 56 of revenue related to previously deferred NYPA rate increases ($35.2 million), gains on the sale of divested generation plants ($37.5 million), increased system benefit charges ($41 million), recovery of incremental NUG cost ($31.0 million), reconciliation of state income tax and gross receipts tax ($110.8 million; see "Income Tax" below) and the reduction in net revenues in 2000 for replacement power costs ($130.0 million), offset by electric rate reductions of $375.6 million in 2001. Electric operating income also increased due to decreased other operations and maintenance expenses of $107.9 million and decreased depreciation and amortization expense of $69.1 million, offset in part by increased property taxes of $33.7 million, federal income tax of $42.3 million and state income tax of $99.1 million (see "Income Tax" below). The $107.9 million decrease in other operations and maintenance expenses reflects principally lower expenses related to Con Edison of New Yorks nuclear generating unit which was sold in September 2001 ($98.4 million), increased pension credits ($42.5 million) and decreased transmission expenses ($11.3 million), offset in part by higher distribution expenses for the relocation of company facilities to avoid interference with municipal infrastructure projects ($13.4 million) and increased system benefit charges ($41 million). Gas Con Edisons gas operating revenues increased $204.0 million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting increased cost of purchased gas, offset in part by a reduction in customers bills of $20.0 million, reflecting a refund of previously deferred credits and other provisions of the gas rate agreement approved by the PSC in November 2000. The increase in operating income of $3.7 million reflects principally an increase in net revenues (operating revenues less gas purchased for resale) of $5.4 million, increased pension credits of $8.2 million, and the recognition in income in the 2001 period of previously deferred gas credits ($7.0 million), offset in part by increased depreciation and amortization expense ($5.3 million), increased state income tax ($8.7 million; see "Income Tax" below) and higher distribution expenses of $3.0 million for the relocation of company facilities to avoid interference with municipal infrastructure projects. Firm gas sales and transportation volume for Con Edisons utility subsidiaries decreased 2.0 percent in 2001 compared with 2000. Con Edisons gas sales and transportation volumes vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the winter. The decrease in volume in 2001 compared with 2000 reflects the warmer 2001 winter compared with 2000. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, in each period, gas sales and transportation volume to firm customers for Con Edison of New York increased 2.8 percent in 2001 compared with 2000. For O&R, weather adjusted gas sales decreased 0.1 percent in 2001 compared with 2000. Steam Con Edison of New Yorks steam operating revenues increased $51.6 million in 2001 compared to 2000, reflecting primarily increased purchased steam and fuel costs (see "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A 57 to the financial statements). Steam operating income increased $2.3 million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting an October 2000 rate increase of $16.6 million. Steam sale volume decreased 5.3 percent in 2001 compared with 2000. The decrease in 2001 reflects the mild winter weather compared with 2000. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, in each period, steam sales volume decreased 2.7 percent in 2001. Unregulated Business Operating revenues of Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries decreased $133.7 million in 2001 compared to 2000, principally reflecting lower gas revenues as result of lower gas sales volumes in the 2001 period compared to 2000. The decrease in operating revenues was offset by a comparable decrease in the cost of gas purchased and other expenses. The unregulated subsidiaries operating income increased $11.6 million in 2001 compared to 2000 due principally to higher electric commodity gross margins and higher wholesale energy trading volumes. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes The principal components of, and variations, in operating taxes were: 2001 Amount Increase/(Decrease) 2001 compared to 2000 (Millions of Dollars) Property taxes $ 649.1 $ 35.1 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 403.3 (22.2 ) Payroll taxes 60.8 1.4 Other taxes 26.3 3.4 Total $ 1,139.5 * $ 17.7 *Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customers in 2001 were $1,520.3 million. Other Income Other income increased $11.4 million in 2001 compared with 2000, due principally to reduced federal income tax expense and the recognition in 2000 of $32.1 million of merger related expenses, offset by the write off in 2001 of an investment of $10.2 million in the New York City Discovery Fund. Net Interest Charges Net interest charges increased $23.4 million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting $28.4 million of increased interest expense for Con Edison of New York related to long term borrowings and $5.7 million of interest expense related to long term borrowing for a 236 MW electric generating facility located in Lakewood, New Jersey (which was purchased in June 2000 by an unregulated subsidiary), offset in part by $10.6 million in 2000 for interest accrued on the net after tax gain from Con Edison of New Yorks 1999 generation divestiture, prior to the disposition of this gain in 2000. See Note I to the financial statements. 58 Income Tax Federal income tax increased $14.9 million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting the changes in income before tax, deductions related to removal costs and tax credits. State income taxes increased $120.6 million in 2001 compared with 2000 as a result of the change in New York State tax law, offset by a corresponding increase in other operating revenues for taxes no longer applicable but still being recovered through rates. See Notes A and L to the financial statements. 59  ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED EDISON COMPANY OF NEW YORK, INC. This discussion and analysis relates to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York or the Company) and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto. Information in the notes referred to in this discussion and analysis is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as "see" or "refer to" shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made. CON EDISON OF NEW YORKS BUSINESS Con Edison of New York is a regulated utility that provides electric service to over 3.1 million customers and gas service to approximately 1.1 million customers in New York City and Westchester County. It also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. All of the common stock of Con Edison of New York is owned by Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY Con Edison of New Yorks net income for common stock for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $605.4 million. Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $649.5 million and $570.1 million, respectively. Con Edison of New Yorks earnings in 2002 were $44.1 million lower than in 2001, reflecting the following factors (after tax, in millions): Lower operation and maintenance expenses (excluding nuclear operations) $ 21.6 Impact of weather (estimated) 18.4 Reserve for electric excess earnings (26.0 ) Amortization of divestiture gain in 2001 (25.0 ) Reduction in gas base rates and lower non firm gas sales (21.3 ) Economic conditions (estimated) (7.5 ) Other (4.3 ) Total $ (44.1 ) The Companys earnings in 2001 were $79.4 million higher than in 2000, reflecting the following factors (after tax, in millions): Lower nuclear production expenses $ 64.0 Impact of weather and economic conditions (estimated) 47.5 Lower depreciation expense 45.5 Amortization of divestiture gain 37.5 Increased pension credits 34.5 Recognition of deferred NYPA rate increase 22.9 Unrecovered Indian Point replacement power costs in 2000 84.5 Electric rate reductions (243.4 ) Taxes other than income, principally property taxes (12.2 ) Other (1.4 ) Total $ 79.4 60 See "Results of Operations" below for further discussion and analysis of results of operations. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Con Edison of New Yorks financial statements reflect the application of its accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companys critical accounting policies include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits and contingencies. The application of certain of these accounting policies requires the Company to use estimates. These estimates require the Company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and for which different estimates that could reasonably have been used could have resulted in material differences in its financial statements. The major critical accounting policies are as follows: Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities SFAS No. 71 Con Edison of New York is a regulated public utility subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, is subject to the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC). SFAS No. 71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under SFAS No. 71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under SFAS No. 71. Con Edison of New Yorks principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The Company is receiving or being credited with a return on all of its regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Company is paying or being charged with a return on all of its regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Companys regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the PSC. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Con Edison of New York provides pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and retirees. The Company accounts for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions." In applying these accounting policies, the Company has made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, future compensation, health care cost trends, and appropriate discount rates. See Notes D and E to the financial statements for information about these assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2002, 2001 and 2000. 61 Primarily because of the amortization of previous years net investment gains, Con Edison of New Yorks pension expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was negative, resulting in a credit to and increase in net income in each year. Investment gains and losses on plan assets are fully recognized in expense over a 15 year period (20 percent of the gains and losses for each year begin to amortize in each of the following five years and the amortization period for each 20 percent portion of the gains and losses is ten years). This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the PSC and is permitted under SFAS No. 87, which provides a "corridor method" for moderating the effect of investment gains and losses on pension expense, or alternatively, allows for any systematic method of amortization of unrecognized gains and losses that is faster than the corridor method and is applied consistently to both gains and losses. Con Edison of New Yorks expense or credit for actual pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend upon actual returns on plan assets and the assumptions the Company makes for future periods. The Companys current estimate for 2003 is a reduction, compared to 2002, in the pension and other postretirement benefits net credit of $54 million after tax. This reduction reflects, among other factors, an actual loss on the pension fund of 8.6 percent in 2002 as compared with an expected annual asset return assumption of 9.2 percent. This variation will reduce net income by $21.3 million after tax in 2003, as compared to 2002. In addition, the Company has lowered its expected annual asset return assumption for the plans for 2003 to 8.8 percent. This revised assumption will reduce net income by $14.5 million after tax in 2003, as compared to 2002. Amortization of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to reduce the pension and other postretirement benefit net credit by an additional $25 million, after tax, in 2004. A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2003 as compared to the expected annual asset return of 8.8 percent would change net income by approximately $6 million in 2004. An actuarial valuation of the plans funded status (which applies to both Con Edison of New York and O&R) was performed as of December 31, 2002. The valuation showed that the fair value of the pension plan assets exceeded its Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) at December 31, 2002. However, the fair market value of Con Edisons pension plan assets could fall below the plans ABO in future years. In that event, Con Edison would be required, under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 132 "Employers Disclosures about Pension and Postretirement Benefits," to accrue a liability equal in amount to the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the ABO, plus its total accrued pension credits, through a non cash charge to other comprehensive income (OCI). The charge to OCI, which would be net of taxes, would not affect the Companys net income for common stock. Con Edison of New York was not required to make cash contributions to its pension plan in 2002 nor will it be required to do so in 2003. Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," applies to an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Companys known material contingencies include a PSC 62 proceeding relating to outages at the nuclear generating unit the Company sold in 2001, workers compensation claims, and its responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and coal tar, that have been used or generated in the course of its operations. See Notes F and G to the financial statements. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, the Company has accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Con Edison of New Yorks liquidity reflects cash flows from its operating, investing and financing activities as shown on the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows and discussed below. As a result of these activities, cash and temporary cash investments (including restricted cash) decreased $176.7 million at December 31, 2002 compared to December 31, 2001. Cash Flows From Operating Activities Con Edison of New Yorks cash flows from operating activities reflect principally its energy sales and its cost of operations. The volume of energy sales is dependent on factors external to the Company such as weather, economic conditions and technological developments. The prices at which the Company provides energy to its customers are determined in accordance with rate agreements approved by the PSC. See "Regulatory Matters," below. In general, changes in the cost of purchased power, fuel and gas affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate agreements. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Net income for common stock is the result of cash and non cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect Con Edison of New Yorks cash flow from operations. Principal non cash charges included depreciation and deferred taxes. Principal non cash credits included accrued pension credits. Pension credits result from past favorable performance in the Companys pension fund and assumptions about future performance. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," above, and Notes D and E to the financial statements. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2002 were $10.1 million more than the 2001 period. The change in cash flows reflect the aforementioned impact of energy sales and its cost of operations, the timing of federal income tax payments and refunds and cash received or expended related to regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets, respectively. The following analysis reflects variations in balance sheet accounts, which also impact specific line items within the consolidated statement of cash flows. The change in these balance sheet line items are utilized to reconcile income to cash flow from operations. Accounts receivable customers, less allowance for uncollectible accounts were $74.7 million higher at December 31, 2002 than at year end 2001, due primarily to higher electric, gas and steam sales in December 2002 as compared to December 2001. The Companys equivalent number of days of revenue outstanding (ENDRO) of customer accounts receivable was 29.3 days at December 31, 2002, compared with 29.6 days at December 31, 2001. 63 Recoverable energy costs increased $101.8 million at December 31, 2002 as compared with year end 2001 due primarily to increased fuel, purchased power and gas costs, resulting from higher sales volumes in December 2002. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Other receivables increased $19.9 million at December 31, 2002 as compared with year end 2001, due primarily to increased gas hedging program receivables. Gas in storage decreased $22.5 million at December 31, 2002 as compared with year end 2001, reflecting primarily the lower volumes in storage as a result of higher withdrawals due to the colder weather at year end 2002 as compared to 2001. Other current assets increased $20.8 million at December 31, 2002 compared with year end 2001, due primarily to an increase in the value of energy marketing contracts. Deferred loss on the sale of the nuclear generating unit decreased $47.6 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 reflecting the recovery of these costs from customers in accordance with the Companys 2000 Electric Rate Agreement. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. Divestiture capacity replacement reconciliation balance decreased $30.0 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 representing the amortization of capacity costs incurred prior to the opening of the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) market in accordance with the Companys 2000 Electric Rate Agreement. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. Deferred environmental remediation costs increased $30.3 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 representing primarily additional liabilities accrued for costs related to Superfund and the other sites, which the Company is permitted to recover under its current rate agreements. See Note F to the financial statements. For information about the regulatory asset for World Trade Center restoration costs, see Note P to the financial statements. Deferred asbestos related costs increased $33.7 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 due to increased liabilities accrued for non employee related asbestos claims (which the Company is permitted to recover under its current rate agreements). See Note F to the financial statements. Other regulatory assets increased $37.4 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 due principally to the reconciliation of taxes collected and the tax expense resulting from New York State tax law changes in accordance with PSC authorization. See Note A to the financial statements and "Other Regulatory Liabilities," below. Accumulated provision for injuries and damages increased $24.5 million at December 31, 2002 as compared with year end 2001, reflecting primarily workers compensation claims relating to asbestos exposure. See Note F to the financial statements. 64 Accounts payable increased $152.0 million at December 31, 2002 as compared with year end 2001. This increase is due primarily to higher electric, gas and steam energy costs at December 31, 2002 as compared to December 31, 2001, reflecting higher sales volumes. See discussion of electric power costs in "Results of Operations," below. Accrued taxes decreased $48.6 million at December 31, 2002 compared with year end 2001, due primarily to the payment of the 2001 fourth quarter federal income tax liability in January 2002. The federal government delayed the timing of the payment in light of the World Trade Center attack. Transmissions congestion contracts increased $119.9 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 reflecting proceeds from the sale of transmission rights on Con Edison of New Yorks transmission system. These proceeds are being retained for customer benefit. The gas rate plan balance of $36.3 million at December 31, 2002 was established in accordance with the 2002 gas rate agreement to provide recovery of costs (net of reimbursement) related to the World Trade Center attack. Electric excess earnings balance of $40.0 million at December 31, 2002 represents a reserve established in 2002 for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return that are to be retained for customer benefit in accordance with the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. During 2002, other regulatory liabilities increased $127.7 million, due primarily to the reconciliation of taxes collected and the tax expense resulting from New York State tax law changes in accordance with PSC authorization and the establishment of a liability to customers for interest earned on a federal income tax refund. Changes in the New York State tax laws applicable to utility companies, effective January 1, 2000, repealed or reduced certain revenue based taxes and instituted a net income based tax. In June 2001, the PSC issued its final Order relating to these tax law changes. It authorized each utility to use deferral accounting to record the difference between taxes being collected and tax expense resulting from tax law changes, until those changes are incorporated into base rates. Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities were $710.3 million higher in 2002 compared with 2001, due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from generation divestiture, net of contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust, in the 2001 period. See "Generation Divestiture," below. In addition, construction expenditures increased $119.6 million in 2002 compared with 2001, principally to meet load growth on the Companys electric distribution systems, to effect permanent restoration of portions of the electric, gas and steam systems in lower Manhattan following the World Trade Center attack and for the ongoing project to add incremental generating capacity at the Companys East River steam electric generating plant (the East River Repowering Project). Cash flows used in investing activities in 2001 decreased $612.7 million compared with 2000, due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from generation divestiture in the 2001 period, which offset increased utility construction expenditures ($93.3 million) related to meet load growth on the Companys electric distribution systems. See "Generation Divestiture" and "Capital Expenditures" below. 65 Deferred real estate sale costs related to the demolition and remediation of a nine acre development site in midtown Manhattan along the East River were $134.4 million at December 31, 2002, compared to $105.4 million at December 31, 2001. In 2000, the Company agreed to sell this site for an expected price of $576 million to $680 million, depending on zoning and other adjustments. The sale is subject to PSC approval and other conditions. The buyer paid Con Edison of New York $50 million in 2000 as a down payment, which the Company used to fund a portion of the demolition and remediation expenses. The down payment has been recorded as a regulatory liability. Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities Net cash flows used in financing activities in 2002 decreased $329.1 million compared with 2001, reflecting principally increased financing for construction expenditures, and reduced dividend payments to the parent. In September 2001, the Company used the proceeds from the sale of its nuclear plant to repay all outstanding short term borrowing. Net repayments of short term debt increased $140.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with 2001 period. The common stock dividend to parent decreased $79.3 million in 2002 compared with 2001. Cash flows used in financing activities in 2001 increased $376.0 million compared with 2000, as a result of decreased borrowings and increased debt redemption. External borrowings are a source of liquidity that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital markets. For information about the Companys credit ratings and certain financial ratios, see "Capital Resources," below. Con Edison of New York had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2002 and at December 31, 2001. The Companys average daily commercial paper outstanding in 2002 was $156.7 million compared to $163.8 million in 2001. The weighted average interest rate was 1.8 percent in 2002 compared to 4.9 percent in 2001. For additional information about the Companys commercial paper program, see Note C to the financial statements. In February 2002, the Company redeemed at maturity $150 million of 6.625 percent 9 year Series 1993C Debentures. In June 2002, the Company redeemed at maturity $150 million of variable rate 5 year Series 1997A Debentures and issued $300 million of non callable 5.625 percent 10 year Series 2002A Debentures. In August 2002, the Company redeemed at maturity $37.1 million of Cumulative Preferred Stock, $100 par value, 6.125 percent, Series J. In December 2002, the Company issued $500 million 4.875 percent 10 year Series 2002B Debentures. In January 2003, the Company redeemed $275 million of 7.75 percent 35 year, Series 1996A, Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures. In October 2002, Con Edison of New York changed the interest rate method applicable to $224.6 million aggregate principal amount of its tax exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2001A from a variable weekly rate mode to a 10 year term mode, callable at par after three years with a 4.70 percent annual interest rate. In addition, the Company entered into a swap agreement in connection with these 66 bonds pursuant to which the Company pays interest at a variable rate equal to the three month LIBOR and is paid interest at a fixed rate of 5.375 percent. See Note O to the financial statements. Generation Divestiture In 2001, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of its interest in the jointly owned Roseton generating station and its nuclear generating unit and related assets. See Note I to the financial statements. Capital Resources Con Edison of New York expects to finance its operations, capital requirements and the payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally generated funds and external borrowings, including commercial paper. For information about Con Edison of New Yorks commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see Note C to the financial statements. In December 2001, the PSC authorized Con Edison of New York to issue up to $1.8 billion of debt securities prior to 2006, of which the Company issued $525 million of debt securities in 2002. The PSC also authorized the refunding of the Companys outstanding debt securities and preferred stock. In August 2002, President Bush signed into law an appropriations bill that authorizes funds for which the Company is eligible to apply for the recovery of costs it incurred in connection with the World Trade Center attack. The procedural guidelines for disbursement of the federal funds are in the process of being developed. See Note P to the financial statements. Con Edison of New Yorks ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 2002, 2001 and 2000 and common equity ratio at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were: 2002 2001 2000 Earnings to fixed charges (SEC basis) 3.35 3.66 3.23 Common equity ratio 46.6 47.2 46.4 The changes in interest coverage in these years reflect changes in pre tax income and changes in interest charges due to debt issuances and refunding. The Companys ratio of earnings to fixed charges increased for 2001 compared to 2000 primarily as a result of increased earnings, reflecting charges in 2000 for replacement power costs ($130 million). See Note G to the financial statements. The commercial paper of Con Edison of New York is rated P 1, A 1 and F 1, respectively, by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), Standard & Poors Rating Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). The senior unsecured debt of Con Edison of New York is rated A1, A+ and A+, respectively, by Moodys, S&P, and Fitch. 67 Capital Requirements The following table compares Con Edison of New Yorks capital requirements for the years 2000 through 2002 and estimated amounts for 2003 and 2004: 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Utility construction expenditures $ 908 $ 983 $ 1,098 $ 1,107 $ 1,031 Retirement of long term securities at maturity 275 628 337 425 * 150 Total $ 1,183 $ 1,611 $ 1,435 $ 1,532 $ 1,181 * Includes redemption in advance of maturity of $275 million of Con Edison of New Yorks Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures Series 1996A in January 2003. The increased regulated utility construction expenditures in 2002 and 2003 reflect expenditures for permanent electric, gas and steam system restoration following the World Trade Center attack, programs to meet increased electric load growth and reliability needs, a higher level of gas infrastructure expenditures and the East River Repowering Project. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following tables summarize Con Edison of New Yorks material obligations to make payments pursuant to contracts. Long term debt and capital lease obligations are included on the Companys balance sheet. Operating leases and non utility generator contracts (NUGs) (for which undiscounted future annual payments are shown) are disclosed in the notes to financial statements. Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long term debt (Note B) $ 5,845 $ 425 $ 600 $ 330 $ 4,490 Capital lease obligations (Note N) 72 8 15 14 35 Operating leases (Note N) 116 38 47 10 21 Non utility generator contracts (Note H) 8,085 526 1,043 1,051 5,465 Natural gas supply, transportation and storage contracts 339 115 108 96 20 Total $ 14,457 $ 1,112 $ 1,813 $ 1,501 $ 10,031 The Company has no material commercial commitments to make payments other than these contractual commitments. ELECTRIC POWER REQUIREMENTS In 2002, Con Edison of New York purchased substantially all of the energy it sold to customers pursuant to firm contracts with NUGs and others or through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market. The Company recovers prudently incurred purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC. See "Financial Market Risks Commodity Price Risk" below and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. From time to time certain parties have petitioned the PSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Con Edison of New Yorks financial position, results or operations or liquidity. 68  To reduce the volatility of electric energy costs, the Company has firm contracts to purchase electric energy (including the output of the nuclear generating unit divested in 2001) and has entered into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of expected purchases which together cover a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to its customers in the summer of 2003. See Notes H and O to the financial statements. The Company also owns 630 MW of electric generating stations located in New York City, the electricity from which it sells through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market. In December 2002, the Company issued a request for proposals seeking a contract to purchase, for no more than 10 years, 500 MW of electric capacity from a new facility located in New York City (or outside the City if there is dedicated new transmission). The East River Repowering Project will add incremental electric capacity of approximately 200 MW based on a winter nominal rating or approximately 125 MW based on a summer nominal rating. The Company does not expect to add any other long term electric generation resources. In a July 1998 order, the PSC indicated that it "agree(s) generally that the Company need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops," but considers "overly broad" and did not adopt its request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, the Company will no longer be required to engage in long range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of capacity. The Company monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO. REGULATORY MATTERS Electric In July 2002, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) to establish a Standard Market Design (SMD) for wholesale electricity markets across the country. The proposed SMD has many of the elements of the markets that have been established in the Northeast, and if adopted, could facilitate transactions among energy markets across the country. The SMD proposes that transmission owners would join Independent Transmission Providers, or ITPs, which would be independent of market participants, would have operational authority for all transmission assets under their control, and would perform certain functions related to day ahead and real time energy markets, determine resource adequacy requirements, financial congestion management, regional planning, market monitoring, and interregional coordination with neighboring ITPs. The Companys transmission facilities, other than those located underground, are currently controlled by the NYISO. In September 1997, the PSC approved a restructuring agreement among Con Edison of New York, PSC staff and certain other parties (the 1997 Restructuring Agreement). Pursuant to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, the Company reduced electric rates on an annual basis by $129 million in 1998, $80 million in 1999, $103 million in 2000 and $209 million in 2001, divested most of its electric generating capacity, and enabled all of its electric customers to choose to be served by competitive energy suppliers. 69 In November 2000, the PSC approved an October 2000 agreement (the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement) that, among other things, revised and extended the electric rate plan provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement and addressed certain generation divestiture related issues. The electric rate plan provisions of the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement cover the five year period ending March 2005. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company reduced the distribution component of its electric rates by $170 million on an annual basis, effective October 2000. The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement continues the rate provisions pursuant to which the Company recovers prudently incurred purchased power and fuel costs from customers. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. For additional information about the 1997 Restructuring Agreement and the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, see "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. Gas In April 2002, the PSC approved a Con Edison of New York gas rate agreement for the three year period ending September 30, 2004. The rate agreement reduces retail sales and transportation rates by $25 million, on an annual basis. In November 2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, PSC staff and certain other parties that revised and extended the 1996 gas rate settlement agreement through September 2001. The 1996 agreement, with limited exceptions, continued base rates at September 1996 levels through September 2000. For additional information, see "Rate and Restructuring" in Note A to the financial statements. Steam In December 2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, PSC staff and certain other parties with respect to the steam rate plan filed by the Company in November 1999. The agreement provides for a $16.6 million steam rate increase, which took effect October 2000 and, with limited exceptions, no further changes in steam rates prior to October 2004. For additional information about the agreement, see "Rate and Restructuring" in Note A to the financial statements. FINANCIAL MARKET RISKS Con Edison of New Yorks primary financial market risks are interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk. Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including utility construction expenditures and maturing debt securities. Con Edison of New York manages interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. The Company estimates that, as of December 31, 2002, a 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt of $615.3 million would result in a change in annual interest expense of $1.1 million. 70 In addition, the Company, from time to time, enters into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See "Interest Rate Hedging" in Note O to the financial statements. Commodity Price Risk Con Edison of New Yorks commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity and gas that the Company delivers to its customers. The Company has risk management strategies to mitigate its related exposure and uses derivative instruments to hedge this price risk. See "Energy Price Hedging" in Note O to the financial statements. Also, see Item 2 of this report for a discussion of the Companys generating capacity. In general, the rates the Company charges customers for electric, gas and steam service fluctuate with the cost of purchased power, gas purchased for resale and fuel used in the generation of steam and electricity, including gains or losses on certain derivative instruments and related transaction costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. The Company estimates that, as of December 31, 2002, a 10 percent change in market prices would result in a change in fair value of $5.7 million for the derivative instruments used by it to hedge purchases of electricity and gas. The Company expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. Credit Risk Con Edison of New York is exposed to credit risk related to over the counter transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities. Credit risk is the loss that may result from a counterpartys nonperformance. The Company uses credit policies to manage its credit risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, master netting agreements and credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, or prepayment arrangements. Investment Risk Con Edison of New Yorks investment risk relates to the investment of the assets in the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See "Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," above. ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES Con Edison of New York has not engaged to a material extent in trading activities that are accounted for at fair value. See "Financial Market Risks" above. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS For information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment, including the Superfund, and from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos, see Note F to the financial statements. IMPACT OF INFLATION Con Edison of New York is affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Company to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of its plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement 71 will substantially exceed historical cost. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companys long term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys results of operations (which were discussed above under "Results of Operations Summary") are discussed below for each of its business segments. The Companys principal business segments are its electric, gas and steam businesses. For additional information about its business segments, see Note L to the financial statements. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 Electric Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating revenues in 2002 decreased $575.2 million compared with 2001, reflecting primarily lower fuel and purchased power costs of $226.9 million (discussed below). The decrease also reflects the completion in March 2002 of amortizations of a previously deferred gain on the sale of divested plants and a previously deferred NYPA revenue increase ($43.3 million), a reserve established in 2002 for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return that are to be retained for customer benefit in accordance with the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement ($40.0 million), a reserve established in 2002 related to the sale of the Companys nuclear generating unit ($24.8 million), the amortization of the loss ($29.9 million) related to the sale of the Companys nuclear generating unit and rate reductions and other amortizations in accordance with the Companys rate agreements. The decrease in electric operating revenues was offset, in part, by an increase in electric sales revenues ($24.0 million) reflecting principally the hot summer weather. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" and "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. Electricity delivery volume in Con Edison of New Yorks service territory increased 1.6 percent in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase reflects the impact of the hot summer weather, offset in part, by the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, electricity delivery volume in the service territory increased 0.5 percent in the 2002 period. The Companys electric purchased power costs decreased $174.6 million in 2002 compared with 2001, due to a decrease in the price of purchased power and an increase in volumes of electricity purchased from other suppliers by participants in the retail access programs. This decrease was offset in part by the Companys increased purchased volumes resulting from the sale of the Companys nuclear generating unit in September 2001 and the hot summer weather in 2002. Fuel costs decreased $52.3 million as a result of decreased generation at Company owned power plants. In general, the Company recovers prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. The Companys electric operating income decreased $92.7 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The principal component of the decrease was lower net electric revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $348.3 million. The decrease in net electric revenues reflects the sale of the nuclear generation unit and the same factors (other than lower fuel and purchased power costs) as discussed above with respect to the decrease in electric operating income. The decrease in net electric 72 revenues was offset in part by reduced other operations and maintenance expenses ($136.8 million) reflecting nuclear production expenses incurred in 2001 but not in 2002, and productivity improvements, lower depreciation and amortization expense ($31.5 million) and lower revenue taxes ($26.2 million). The decrease is also offset by lower operating income tax of $61.8 million. Gas Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating revenues decreased $223.4 million, resulting primarily from the lower cost of purchased gas ($194.2 million) in 2002 compared with 2001. The lower cost of purchased gas reflects primarily lower unit costs. The lower revenues also reflect reduced sales volumes, resulting primarily from the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and revenue reductions implemented in accordance with the gas rate agreement approved by the PSC in April 2002. Gas operating income decreased $7.9 million in 2002, reflecting a $29.2 million decrease in net revenues (operating revenues less gas purchased for resale), and increased property tax expense ($9.6 million), offset in part by reduced operations and maintenance expenses ($16.2 million), reduced revenue taxes ($10.3 million) and lower income taxes ($8.7 million). Gas sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 3.5 percent in the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the Companys service territory decreased 1.5 percent in the 2002 period. The Companys gas sales and transportation volumes vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the winter. A weather normalization provision that applies to the Companys gas business moderates, but does not completely eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on gas operating income. Steam Con Edison of New Yorks steam operating revenues decreased $99.7 million. The lower revenues reflect reduced sales volumes and lower fuel and purchased power costs primarily as a result of the loss of the World Trade Center as a customer, the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy. The lower fuel and purchased power costs reflect primarily lower unit costs. Steam operating income increased $8.2 million for 2002 compared with 2001 due primarily to reduced operations and maintenance expenses of $9.3 million and lower income taxes of $10.5 million, offset in part by a decrease in net revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $11.1 million. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Steam sales volume decreased 3.2 percent in the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with the year ended December 31, 2001, reflecting primarily the loss of the World Trade Center as a customer, the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, steam sales volume decreased 1.4 percent. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes At $1.0 billion, taxes other than income taxes remain one of Con Edison of New Yorks largest operating expenses. 73 The principal components of, and variations in, operating taxes were: Increase/(Decrease) 2002 Amount 2002 compared to 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Property taxes $ 629.8 $ 9.4 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 326.9 (37.6 ) Payroll taxes 54.4 (1.7 ) Other taxes 28.3 2.0 Total $ 1,039.4 * $ (27.9 ) *Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customers in 2002 were $1,351.0 million. Effective in 2003, New York City increased the Companys annual property taxes by $96 million. Under the Companys rate agreements, the Company is deferring the property tax increase as a regulatory asset to be recovered from customers. Other Income Investment income decreased $4.1 million in 2002 compared to 2001, due principally to reduced interest income earned on short term cash investments in the 2002 period as compared to the 2001 period. For the 2001 period, the Company had more cash on hand than the 2002 period, primarily as a result of the sale of its nuclear generating unit. Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $8.2 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily reflecting the East River Repowering Project. Other income increased $41.7 million in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to $26.7 million of interest income on a federal income tax refund claim, a $10.2 million write off in 2001 of an investment in the New York Discovery Fund in 2001, a $9.4 million increase in interest earned on regulatory assets (See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities SFAS No. 71," above), offset in part by reduced income of $2.5 million from non utility operations. Income tax expense decreased $4.4 million in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to the recognition of tax benefits relating to the September 2001 sale of the Companys nuclear generating unit. Net Interest Charges Net interest charges increased $6.6 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2001. The increase reflects principally the interest expense associated with a net federal income tax deficiency related to a prior period audit ($19.1 million), partially offset by decreased interest expense on long term debt of $14.9 million. Income Tax Federal income tax decreased $28.6 million in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting lower income before tax and deductions related to removal costs and tax credits. In 2000, New York State implemented a tax law change that reduced or repealed certain revenue based taxes and replaced them with the imposition of a net income based tax. State income taxes decreased $56.8 million in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting lower income before tax, lowering of the tax rate and prior period adjustments. The state income tax expense is offset against the savings from the eliminated or reduced revenue taxes. Any over or under 74 collection of these taxes is deferred for return to, or recovery from, customers. See Notes A and L to the financial statements. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 Electric Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating revenues in 2001 decreased $116.7 million from 2000. The decrease in 2001 reflects decreased purchased power costs (see "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements) and electric rate reductions of $374.5 million, offset by economic growth and the effects of the warmer than normal summer weather when compared to cooler than normal weather for the 2000 period. Electricity sales volume in the Companys service territory increased 3.0 percent in 2001. The increase in sales volume reflects the warmer than normal summer weather and economic growth. The Companys electric sales vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the summer. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, in each period, electricity sales volume in Con Edison of New Yorks service territory increased 2.4 percent in 2001. The Companys electric operating income increased $90.5 million in 2001 compared with 2000. The increase in electric operating income was primarily comprised of an increase in net revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $63.6 million. The increase in net revenues reflects principally increased sales ($64.1 million), recognition of revenue related to previously deferred NYPA rate increases ($35.2 million), gain on the sale of divested generating plants ($37.5 million), increased revenues associated with system benefits charges ($32.8 million), recovery of incremental NUG cost ($31.0 million), reconciliation of state income tax and gross receipts tax ($110.8 million; see "Income Tax," below) and non recurring charges in 2000 for replacement power costs ($130.0 million), offset by electric rate reductions of $374.5 million. Electric operating income also increased due to decreased other operations and maintenance expenses of $108.4 million (discussed below) and decreased depreciation expense of $73.6 million, offset in part by increased property taxes of $33.7 million, federal income tax of $40.1 million and state income tax of $98.8 million (see "Income Tax," below). The $108.4 million decrease in other operations and maintenance expenses reflects principally lower expenses related to the Companys nuclear generating unit which was sold in September 2001 ($98.4 million), increased pension credits ($42.5 million) and decreased transmission expenses ($9.9 million), offset in part by higher distribution expenses for the relocation of Company facilities to avoid interference with municipal infrastructure projects ($13.4 million) and increased system benefits charges ($32.8 million). Gas Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating revenues increased $186.6 million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting increased cost of purchased gas, offset in part by a reduction in customers bills of $20.0 million, reflecting a refund of previously deferred credits and other provisions of the gas rate agreement approved by the PSC in November 2000. Operating income in 2001 increased $1.6 million compared with 2000, reflecting an increase in net revenues (operating revenues less gas purchased for resale) of $11.2 million and increased pension credits of $8.2 million, offset in part by increased depreciation and 75 amortization expense ($3.9 million), increased state income tax ($8.2 million; see "Income Tax" below), increased uncollectible account write offs ($1.9 million) and higher distribution expenses for the relocation of Company facilities to avoid interference with municipal infrastructure projects ($3.0 million). Gas sales and transportation volume to firm customers decreased 0.4 percent in 2001 compared with 2000. The Companys gas sales and transportation volumes vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the winter. The decrease in volume in 2001 compared with 2000 reflects the warmer 2001 winter compared with 2000. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, in each period, gas sales and transportation volume to firm customers increased 2.8 percent in 2001. Steam Con Edison of New Yorks steam operating revenues increased $51.6 million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting primarily increased purchased steam and fuel costs (see "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements). Steam operating income increased $2.3 million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting an October 2000 rate increase of $16.6 million. Steam sales volume decreased 5.3 percent in 2001 and increased 0.8 percent in 2000. The decrease in 2001 reflects the mild 2001 winter weather compared with 2000. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, in each period, steam sales volume decreased 2.7 percent in 2001. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes The principal components of and variations in operating taxes were: Increase/(Decrease) 2001 Amount 2001 compared to 2000 (Millions of Dollars) Property taxes $ 620.4 $ 33.6 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 364.5 (19.2 ) Payroll taxes 56.2 1.1 Other taxes 26.3 3.5 Total $ 1,067.4 * $ 19.0 *Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customers in 2001 were $1,414.4 million. Other Income Other income increased $0.9 million in 2001 compared with 2000, due principally to deferred federal income tax credits realized, offset by a write off in 2001 of an investment of $10.2 million in the New York City Discovery Fund. Net Interest Charges Net interest charges increased $16.0 million in 2001, compared with 2000, reflecting principally $28.4 million of increased interest expense for Con Edison of New York related to long term borrowings, offset in part by a decrease of $8.4 million related to short term borrowings and $7.0 million of interest accrued on the net after tax gain from generation divestiture prior to regulatory disposition of the gain in 2000. See Note I to the financial statements. 76 Income Tax Federal income tax increased $19.7 million in 2001, reflecting the change in income before tax, deductions related to removal costs and tax credits. State income taxes increased $117.5 million in 2001 compared with 2000 as the result of the change in New York State tax law, offset by a corresponding increase in other operating revenues for taxes no longer applicable but still being recovered through rates. See Notes A and J to the financial statements. 77  MANAGEMENTS NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ORANGE AND ROCKLAND UTILITIES, INC. Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R or the Company), a wholly owned subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison), meets the conditions specified in General Instruction I of Form 10 K and is permitted to use the reduced disclosure format for wholly owned subsidiaries of companies, like Con Edison, that are reporting companies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, this O&R Managements Narrative Analysis of Results of Operations is included in this report, and O&R has omitted from this report the information called for by Part II, Item 7 of Form 10 K (Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). This narrative analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of O&R and its subsidiaries and the notes thereto. Information in the notes referred to in this narrative analysis is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as "see" or "refer to" shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this narrative analysis the information to which reference is made. O&RS BUSINESS O&R is a regulated utility that, along with its regulated utility subsidiaries, provides electric service to over 285,000 customers in southeastern New York and in adjacent sections of New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania and gas service to over 120,000 customers in southeastern New York and northeastern Pennsylvania. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY O&Rs net income for common stock for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $44.9 million, $4.7 million higher than the corresponding 2001 period. The increase in the Companys net income was attributable primarily to higher electric sales volumes due to warmer than normal weather, customer growth and higher average usage, which produced an additional $7.3 million of net electric revenues (operating revenues less purchased power costs). While firm gas volumes were down slightly, gas net revenues increased by $0.8 million due primarily to incentives earned from interruptible and off system gas sales. Income taxes and revenue taxes decreased by $3.2 million due to lowered tax rates in New York. The higher net revenues and lower taxes were partially offset by $4.9 million in higher interest charges that resulted from a change by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) to the carrying charges allowed on the Companys deferred purchased power balance in New Jersey. This expense was offset in part by lower net financing costs of $1.4 million. Operation and maintenance costs increased by $1.2 million and depreciation charges were $1.2 million higher. See "Results of Operations Business Segments" below for further analysis of earnings. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES O&Rs financial statements reflect the application of its accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companys critical accounting policies include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits and contingencies. 78 The application of certain of these accounting policies requires the Company to use estimates. These estimates require the Company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and for which different estimates that could reasonably have been used could have resulted in material differences in its financial statements. Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities SFAS No. 71 O&R is a regulated public utility subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, is subject to the accounting requirements and rate making practices of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction. SFAS No. 71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under SFAS No. 71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under SFAS No. 71. O&Rs principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The Company is receiving or being credited with a return on all of its regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Company is paying or being charged with a return on all of its regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Companys regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits O&R and its subsidiaries provide pension and other postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and retirees. The Company accounts for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions." In applying these accounting policies, the Company has made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, future compensation and health care cost trends, and appropriate discount rates. See Notes D and E to the financial statements for information about these assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2002, 2001 and 2000. Plan expense or credit in future periods will depend on the assumptions the Company makes and the actual performance of the pension fund. In accordance with SFAS No. 71 and consistent with rate provisions approved by the applicable state public utility authorities, O&R defers as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability, any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No. 87 and the amounts reflected in rates for such expenses. An actuarial valuation of Con Edisons pension plans funded status (which applies to both Con Edison of New York and O&R) was performed as of December 31, 2002. The valuation showed that the fair value 79 of the pension plan assets exceeded its Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) at December 31, 2002. However, the fair market value of Con Edisons pension plan assets could fall below the plans ABO in future years. In that event, O&R would be required, under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pension and Postretirement Benefits," to accrue a liability equal in the amount to the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the ABO, less its accrued pension liability through a charge to other comprehensive income (OCI). The charge to OCI, which would be net of taxes, would not affect O&Rs net income. Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," applies to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Companys known material contingencies include workers compensation claims, and its responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, that have been used or generated in the course of its operations. See Note F to the financial statements. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, the Company has accrued estimates of its losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys results of operations (which were discussed above under "Results of Operations Summary") are discussed below for each of its business segments. The Companys principal business segments are its electric and gas utility businesses. For additional information about its business segments, see Note P to the financial statements. Electric Electric operating revenues decreased $62.9 million during 2002 compared to 2001. This decrease was primarily the result of lower purchased power costs and tax recoveries in 2002. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Electric sales volumes in 2002 increased 5.8 percent compared to 2001 due to warmer than normal summer weather, customer growth and higher average usage. After adjusting for weather variations, total electricity sales volumes were 3.2 percent higher in 2002. Net electric revenues (operating revenues less purchased power) were $7.3 million higher in 2002 than in 2001. Purchased power costs decreased $70.2 million during 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting decreases in the unit cost of purchased power and increased volumes of electricity purchased by customers from other suppliers, partially offset by higher energy usage by full service customers. Electric operating income increased $7.3 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. This increase reflects the impact of higher net electric revenues along with lower New York state and local income and revenue taxes, offset in part by higher operation and maintenance charges and depreciation costs. 80 Gas Gas operating revenues decreased $39.0 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. This decrease was primarily the result of lower gas costs and sales to firm customers in 2002. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Total firm gas sales volumes in 2002 decreased 1.1 percent compared to 2001. Revenues from gas sales in New York are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. After adjusting for weather variations in each period, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 0.3 percent lower for 2002 compared to 2001. Net gas revenues (operating revenues less purchased gas) were $0.7 million higher in 2002 due primarily to incentives earned from interruptible and off system gas sales. The cost of gas purchased for resale was $39.8 million less in 2002 than in 2001, reflecting lower sales volumes and unit costs. Decreased gas revenues also reflect the reduced requirement for the Company to buy gas for resale because of an increase in the purchase of gas by customers from other suppliers. Gas operating income increased by $1.4 million in 2002, compared to 2001, due primarily to higher net revenues and lower operations and maintenance expenses, offset in part by lower late payment charge revenues and higher depreciation. Other Operations and Maintenance Other operations and maintenance expense increased $1.2 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase was attributable primarily to higher electric transmission and distribution expenditures, partially offset by lower customer bad debt and collections expense. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes decreased by $1.5 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The decrease was primarily the result of lower New York State revenue taxes of $2.7 million, which resulted from reduced tax rates and lower energy costs billed to customers. Partially offsetting this decrease were higher property taxes of $0.9 million. The principal components of, and variations, in operating taxes were: Increase/(Decrease) 2002 Amount 2002 compared to 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Property taxes $ 27.3 $ 0.9 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 21.2 (2.7 ) Payroll taxes 3.8 0.1 Other taxes 0.1 0.2 Total $ 52.4 * $ (1.5 ) * Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes, billed to customers in 2002 was $70.8 million. 81 Net Interest Charges Interest charges increased by $4.1 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily as a result of a change by the NJBPU in the carrying charges allowed on the Companys deferred purchased power balance in New Jersey ($4.9 million) and lower allowance for borrowed funds used during construction ($0.6 million). These expenses were offset in part by lower net financing costs of $1.4 million that resulted from lower average debt balances and interest rates in 2002. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased by $1.6 million in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting primarily lower state income taxes. State income taxes decreased primarily as a result of a 0.5 percent reduction in the New York State tax rate. Excluding certain taxes in New York that are reconciled to amounts included in rates, income taxes increased by $1.7 million due primarily to higher operating income in 2002. 82  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Con Edison For information about Con Edisons primary market risks associated with activities in derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments, see "Financial Market Risks" in Con Edisons MD&A in Item 7 (which information is incorporated herein by reference). Con Edison of New York For information about Con Edison of New Yorks primary market risks associated with activities in derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments, see "Financial Market Risks" in Con Edison of New Yorks MD&A in Item 7 (which information is incorporated herein by reference). O&R O&Rs primary financial market risks are interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk. Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including utility construction expenditures and maturing debt securities. O&R and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. The Company estimates that, as of December 31, 2002, a 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt of $45.0 million would result in a change in annual interest expense of $0.1 million. In addition, O&R and its subsidiaries from time to time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See Note P to the financial statements. Commodity Price Risk O&Rs commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity and gas that the Company delivers to its customers. The Company has risk management strategies to mitigate its related exposure and uses derivative instruments to hedge this price risk. See Note P to the financial statements. In general, the rates O&R and its subsidiaries charge customers for electric and gas service fluctuate with the cost of purchased power, gas purchased for resale and fuel used in the generation of electricity, including gains or losses on certain derivative instruments and related transaction costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. O&R estimates that, as of December 31, 2002, a 10 percent change in market prices would result in a change in fair value of $1.7 million for the derivative instruments used by it to hedge purchases of electricity and gas. The Company expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. Credit Risk O&R is exposed to credit risk related to over the counter transactions entered into primarily for various energy supply and hedging activities. Credit risk is the loss that may result from a counterpartys 83 nonperformance. The Company uses credit policies to manage its credit risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, master netting agreements, and credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, or prepayment arrangements. Investment Risk O&Rs investment risk relates to the investment of the assets in the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See "Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," in Part II Item 7. 84  
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED EDISON COMPANY OF NEW YORK, INC. This discussion and analysis relates to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York or the Company) and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto. Information in the notes referred to in this discussion and analysis is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as "see" or "refer to" shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made. CON EDISON OF NEW YORKS BUSINESS Con Edison of New York is a regulated utility that provides electric service to over 3.1 million customers and gas service to approximately 1.1 million customers in New York City and Westchester County. It also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. All of the common stock of Con Edison of New York is owned by Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY Con Edison of New Yorks net income for common stock for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $605.4 million. Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $649.5 million and $570.1 million, respectively. Con Edison of New Yorks earnings in 2002 were $44.1 million lower than in 2001, reflecting the following factors (after tax, in millions): Lower operation and maintenance expenses (excluding nuclear operations) $ 21.6 Impact of weather (estimated) 18.4 Reserve for electric excess earnings (26.0 ) Amortization of divestiture gain in 2001 (25.0 ) Reduction in gas base rates and lower non firm gas sales (21.3 ) Economic conditions (estimated) (7.5 ) Other (4.3 ) Total $ (44.1 ) The Companys earnings in 2001 were $79.4 million higher than in 2000, reflecting the following factors (after tax, in millions): Lower nuclear production expenses $ 64.0 Impact of weather and economic conditions (estimated) 47.5 Lower depreciation expense 45.5 Amortization of divestiture gain 37.5 Increased pension credits 34.5 Recognition of deferred NYPA rate increase 22.9 Unrecovered Indian Point replacement power costs in 2000 84.5 Electric rate reductions (243.4 ) Taxes other than income, principally property taxes (12.2 ) Other (1.4 ) Total $ 79.4 60 See "Results of Operations" below for further discussion and analysis of results of operations. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Con Edison of New Yorks financial statements reflect the application of its accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companys critical accounting policies include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits and contingencies. The application of certain of these accounting policies requires the Company to use estimates. These estimates require the Company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and for which different estimates that could reasonably have been used could have resulted in material differences in its financial statements. The major critical accounting policies are as follows: Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities SFAS No. 71 Con Edison of New York is a regulated public utility subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, is subject to the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC). SFAS No. 71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under SFAS No. 71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under SFAS No. 71. Con Edison of New Yorks principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The Company is receiving or being credited with a return on all of its regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Company is paying or being charged with a return on all of its regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Companys regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the PSC. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Con Edison of New York provides pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and retirees. The Company accounts for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions." In applying these accounting policies, the Company has made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, future compensation, health care cost trends, and appropriate discount rates. See Notes D and E to the financial statements for information about these assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2002, 2001 and 2000. 61 Primarily because of the amortization of previous years net investment gains, Con Edison of New Yorks pension expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was negative, resulting in a credit to and increase in net income in each year. Investment gains and losses on plan assets are fully recognized in expense over a 15 year period (20 percent of the gains and losses for each year begin to amortize in each of the following five years and the amortization period for each 20 percent portion of the gains and losses is ten years). This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the PSC and is permitted under SFAS No. 87, which provides a "corridor method" for moderating the effect of investment gains and losses on pension expense, or alternatively, allows for any systematic method of amortization of unrecognized gains and losses that is faster than the corridor method and is applied consistently to both gains and losses. Con Edison of New Yorks expense or credit for actual pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend upon actual returns on plan assets and the assumptions the Company makes for future periods. The Companys current estimate for 2003 is a reduction, compared to 2002, in the pension and other postretirement benefits net credit of $54 million after tax. This reduction reflects, among other factors, an actual loss on the pension fund of 8.6 percent in 2002 as compared with an expected annual asset return assumption of 9.2 percent. This variation will reduce net income by $21.3 million after tax in 2003, as compared to 2002. In addition, the Company has lowered its expected annual asset return assumption for the plans for 2003 to 8.8 percent. This revised assumption will reduce net income by $14.5 million after tax in 2003, as compared to 2002. Amortization of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to reduce the pension and other postretirement benefit net credit by an additional $25 million, after tax, in 2004. A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2003 as compared to the expected annual asset return of 8.8 percent would change net income by approximately $6 million in 2004. An actuarial valuation of the plans funded status (which applies to both Con Edison of New York and O&R) was performed as of December 31, 2002. The valuation showed that the fair value of the pension plan assets exceeded its Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) at December 31, 2002. However, the fair market value of Con Edisons pension plan assets could fall below the plans ABO in future years. In that event, Con Edison would be required, under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 132 "Employers Disclosures about Pension and Postretirement Benefits," to accrue a liability equal in amount to the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the ABO, plus its total accrued pension credits, through a non cash charge to other comprehensive income (OCI). The charge to OCI, which would be net of taxes, would not affect the Companys net income for common stock. Con Edison of New York was not required to make cash contributions to its pension plan in 2002 nor will it be required to do so in 2003. Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," applies to an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Companys known material contingencies include a PSC 62 proceeding relating to outages at the nuclear generating unit the Company sold in 2001, workers compensation claims, and its responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and coal tar, that have been used or generated in the course of its operations. See Notes F and G to the financial statements. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, the Company has accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Con Edison of New Yorks liquidity reflects cash flows from its operating, investing and financing activities as shown on the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows and discussed below. As a result of these activities, cash and temporary cash investments (including restricted cash) decreased $176.7 million at December 31, 2002 compared to December 31, 2001. Cash Flows From Operating Activities Con Edison of New Yorks cash flows from operating activities reflect principally its energy sales and its cost of operations. The volume of energy sales is dependent on factors external to the Company such as weather, economic conditions and technological developments. The prices at which the Company provides energy to its customers are determined in accordance with rate agreements approved by the PSC. See "Regulatory Matters," below. In general, changes in the cost of purchased power, fuel and gas affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate agreements. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Net income for common stock is the result of cash and non cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect Con Edison of New Yorks cash flow from operations. Principal non cash charges included depreciation and deferred taxes. Principal non cash credits included accrued pension credits. Pension credits result from past favorable performance in the Companys pension fund and assumptions about future performance. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," above, and Notes D and E to the financial statements. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2002 were $10.1 million more than the 2001 period. The change in cash flows reflect the aforementioned impact of energy sales and its cost of operations, the timing of federal income tax payments and refunds and cash received or expended related to regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets, respectively. The following analysis reflects variations in balance sheet accounts, which also impact specific line items within the consolidated statement of cash flows. The change in these balance sheet line items are utilized to reconcile income to cash flow from operations. Accounts receivable customers, less allowance for uncollectible accounts were $74.7 million higher at December 31, 2002 than at year end 2001, due primarily to higher electric, gas and steam sales in December 2002 as compared to December 2001. The Companys equivalent number of days of revenue outstanding (ENDRO) of customer accounts receivable was 29.3 days at December 31, 2002, compared with 29.6 days at December 31, 2001. 63 Recoverable energy costs increased $101.8 million at December 31, 2002 as compared with year end 2001 due primarily to increased fuel, purchased power and gas costs, resulting from higher sales volumes in December 2002. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Other receivables increased $19.9 million at December 31, 2002 as compared with year end 2001, due primarily to increased gas hedging program receivables. Gas in storage decreased $22.5 million at December 31, 2002 as compared with year end 2001, reflecting primarily the lower volumes in storage as a result of higher withdrawals due to the colder weather at year end 2002 as compared to 2001. Other current assets increased $20.8 million at December 31, 2002 compared with year end 2001, due primarily to an increase in the value of energy marketing contracts. Deferred loss on the sale of the nuclear generating unit decreased $47.6 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 reflecting the recovery of these costs from customers in accordance with the Companys 2000 Electric Rate Agreement. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. Divestiture capacity replacement reconciliation balance decreased $30.0 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 representing the amortization of capacity costs incurred prior to the opening of the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) market in accordance with the Companys 2000 Electric Rate Agreement. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. Deferred environmental remediation costs increased $30.3 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 representing primarily additional liabilities accrued for costs related to Superfund and the other sites, which the Company is permitted to recover under its current rate agreements. See Note F to the financial statements. For information about the regulatory asset for World Trade Center restoration costs, see Note P to the financial statements. Deferred asbestos related costs increased $33.7 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 due to increased liabilities accrued for non employee related asbestos claims (which the Company is permitted to recover under its current rate agreements). See Note F to the financial statements. Other regulatory assets increased $37.4 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 due principally to the reconciliation of taxes collected and the tax expense resulting from New York State tax law changes in accordance with PSC authorization. See Note A to the financial statements and "Other Regulatory Liabilities," below. Accumulated provision for injuries and damages increased $24.5 million at December 31, 2002 as compared with year end 2001, reflecting primarily workers compensation claims relating to asbestos exposure. See Note F to the financial statements. 64 Accounts payable increased $152.0 million at December 31, 2002 as compared with year end 2001. This increase is due primarily to higher electric, gas and steam energy costs at December 31, 2002 as compared to December 31, 2001, reflecting higher sales volumes. See discussion of electric power costs in "Results of Operations," below. Accrued taxes decreased $48.6 million at December 31, 2002 compared with year end 2001, due primarily to the payment of the 2001 fourth quarter federal income tax liability in January 2002. The federal government delayed the timing of the payment in light of the World Trade Center attack. Transmissions congestion contracts increased $119.9 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to year end 2001 reflecting proceeds from the sale of transmission rights on Con Edison of New Yorks transmission system. These proceeds are being retained for customer benefit. The gas rate plan balance of $36.3 million at December 31, 2002 was established in accordance with the 2002 gas rate agreement to provide recovery of costs (net of reimbursement) related to the World Trade Center attack. Electric excess earnings balance of $40.0 million at December 31, 2002 represents a reserve established in 2002 for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return that are to be retained for customer benefit in accordance with the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. During 2002, other regulatory liabilities increased $127.7 million, due primarily to the reconciliation of taxes collected and the tax expense resulting from New York State tax law changes in accordance with PSC authorization and the establishment of a liability to customers for interest earned on a federal income tax refund. Changes in the New York State tax laws applicable to utility companies, effective January 1, 2000, repealed or reduced certain revenue based taxes and instituted a net income based tax. In June 2001, the PSC issued its final Order relating to these tax law changes. It authorized each utility to use deferral accounting to record the difference between taxes being collected and tax expense resulting from tax law changes, until those changes are incorporated into base rates. Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities were $710.3 million higher in 2002 compared with 2001, due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from generation divestiture, net of contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust, in the 2001 period. See "Generation Divestiture," below. In addition, construction expenditures increased $119.6 million in 2002 compared with 2001, principally to meet load growth on the Companys electric distribution systems, to effect permanent restoration of portions of the electric, gas and steam systems in lower Manhattan following the World Trade Center attack and for the ongoing project to add incremental generating capacity at the Companys East River steam electric generating plant (the East River Repowering Project). Cash flows used in investing activities in 2001 decreased $612.7 million compared with 2000, due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from generation divestiture in the 2001 period, which offset increased utility construction expenditures ($93.3 million) related to meet load growth on the Companys electric distribution systems. See "Generation Divestiture" and "Capital Expenditures" below. 65 Deferred real estate sale costs related to the demolition and remediation of a nine acre development site in midtown Manhattan along the East River were $134.4 million at December 31, 2002, compared to $105.4 million at December 31, 2001. In 2000, the Company agreed to sell this site for an expected price of $576 million to $680 million, depending on zoning and other adjustments. The sale is subject to PSC approval and other conditions. The buyer paid Con Edison of New York $50 million in 2000 as a down payment, which the Company used to fund a portion of the demolition and remediation expenses. The down payment has been recorded as a regulatory liability. Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities Net cash flows used in financing activities in 2002 decreased $329.1 million compared with 2001, reflecting principally increased financing for construction expenditures, and reduced dividend payments to the parent. In September 2001, the Company used the proceeds from the sale of its nuclear plant to repay all outstanding short term borrowing. Net repayments of short term debt increased $140.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with 2001 period. The common stock dividend to parent decreased $79.3 million in 2002 compared with 2001. Cash flows used in financing activities in 2001 increased $376.0 million compared with 2000, as a result of decreased borrowings and increased debt redemption. External borrowings are a source of liquidity that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital markets. For information about the Companys credit ratings and certain financial ratios, see "Capital Resources," below. Con Edison of New York had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2002 and at December 31, 2001. The Companys average daily commercial paper outstanding in 2002 was $156.7 million compared to $163.8 million in 2001. The weighted average interest rate was 1.8 percent in 2002 compared to 4.9 percent in 2001. For additional information about the Companys commercial paper program, see Note C to the financial statements. In February 2002, the Company redeemed at maturity $150 million of 6.625 percent 9 year Series 1993C Debentures. In June 2002, the Company redeemed at maturity $150 million of variable rate 5 year Series 1997A Debentures and issued $300 million of non callable 5.625 percent 10 year Series 2002A Debentures. In August 2002, the Company redeemed at maturity $37.1 million of Cumulative Preferred Stock, $100 par value, 6.125 percent, Series J. In December 2002, the Company issued $500 million 4.875 percent 10 year Series 2002B Debentures. In January 2003, the Company redeemed $275 million of 7.75 percent 35 year, Series 1996A, Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures. In October 2002, Con Edison of New York changed the interest rate method applicable to $224.6 million aggregate principal amount of its tax exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2001A from a variable weekly rate mode to a 10 year term mode, callable at par after three years with a 4.70 percent annual interest rate. In addition, the Company entered into a swap agreement in connection with these 66 bonds pursuant to which the Company pays interest at a variable rate equal to the three month LIBOR and is paid interest at a fixed rate of 5.375 percent. See Note O to the financial statements. Generation Divestiture In 2001, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of its interest in the jointly owned Roseton generating station and its nuclear generating unit and related assets. See Note I to the financial statements. Capital Resources Con Edison of New York expects to finance its operations, capital requirements and the payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally generated funds and external borrowings, including commercial paper. For information about Con Edison of New Yorks commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see Note C to the financial statements. In December 2001, the PSC authorized Con Edison of New York to issue up to $1.8 billion of debt securities prior to 2006, of which the Company issued $525 million of debt securities in 2002. The PSC also authorized the refunding of the Companys outstanding debt securities and preferred stock. In August 2002, President Bush signed into law an appropriations bill that authorizes funds for which the Company is eligible to apply for the recovery of costs it incurred in connection with the World Trade Center attack. The procedural guidelines for disbursement of the federal funds are in the process of being developed. See Note P to the financial statements. Con Edison of New Yorks ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 2002, 2001 and 2000 and common equity ratio at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were: 2002 2001 2000 Earnings to fixed charges (SEC basis) 3.35 3.66 3.23 Common equity ratio 46.6 47.2 46.4 The changes in interest coverage in these years reflect changes in pre tax income and changes in interest charges due to debt issuances and refunding. The Companys ratio of earnings to fixed charges increased for 2001 compared to 2000 primarily as a result of increased earnings, reflecting charges in 2000 for replacement power costs ($130 million). See Note G to the financial statements. The commercial paper of Con Edison of New York is rated P 1, A 1 and F 1, respectively, by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), Standard & Poors Rating Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). The senior unsecured debt of Con Edison of New York is rated A1, A+ and A+, respectively, by Moodys, S&P, and Fitch. 67 Capital Requirements The following table compares Con Edison of New Yorks capital requirements for the years 2000 through 2002 and estimated amounts for 2003 and 2004: 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Utility construction expenditures $ 908 $ 983 $ 1,098 $ 1,107 $ 1,031 Retirement of long term securities at maturity 275 628 337 425 * 150 Total $ 1,183 $ 1,611 $ 1,435 $ 1,532 $ 1,181 * Includes redemption in advance of maturity of $275 million of Con Edison of New Yorks Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures Series 1996A in January 2003. The increased regulated utility construction expenditures in 2002 and 2003 reflect expenditures for permanent electric, gas and steam system restoration following the World Trade Center attack, programs to meet increased electric load growth and reliability needs, a higher level of gas infrastructure expenditures and the East River Repowering Project. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following tables summarize Con Edison of New Yorks material obligations to make payments pursuant to contracts. Long term debt and capital lease obligations are included on the Companys balance sheet. Operating leases and non utility generator contracts (NUGs) (for which undiscounted future annual payments are shown) are disclosed in the notes to financial statements. Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long term debt (Note B) $ 5,845 $ 425 $ 600 $ 330 $ 4,490 Capital lease obligations (Note N) 72 8 15 14 35 Operating leases (Note N) 116 38 47 10 21 Non utility generator contracts (Note H) 8,085 526 1,043 1,051 5,465 Natural gas supply, transportation and storage contracts 339 115 108 96 20 Total $ 14,457 $ 1,112 $ 1,813 $ 1,501 $ 10,031 The Company has no material commercial commitments to make payments other than these contractual commitments. ELECTRIC POWER REQUIREMENTS In 2002, Con Edison of New York purchased substantially all of the energy it sold to customers pursuant to firm contracts with NUGs and others or through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market. The Company recovers prudently incurred purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC. See "Financial Market Risks Commodity Price Risk" below and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. From time to time certain parties have petitioned the PSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Con Edison of New Yorks financial position, results or operations or liquidity. 68  To reduce the volatility of electric energy costs, the Company has firm contracts to purchase electric energy (including the output of the nuclear generating unit divested in 2001) and has entered into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of expected purchases which together cover a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to its customers in the summer of 2003. See Notes H and O to the financial statements. The Company also owns 630 MW of electric generating stations located in New York City, the electricity from which it sells through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market. In December 2002, the Company issued a request for proposals seeking a contract to purchase, for no more than 10 years, 500 MW of electric capacity from a new facility located in New York City (or outside the City if there is dedicated new transmission). The East River Repowering Project will add incremental electric capacity of approximately 200 MW based on a winter nominal rating or approximately 125 MW based on a summer nominal rating. The Company does not expect to add any other long term electric generation resources. In a July 1998 order, the PSC indicated that it "agree(s) generally that the Company need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops," but considers "overly broad" and did not adopt its request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, the Company will no longer be required to engage in long range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of capacity. The Company monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO. REGULATORY MATTERS Electric In July 2002, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) to establish a Standard Market Design (SMD) for wholesale electricity markets across the country. The proposed SMD has many of the elements of the markets that have been established in the Northeast, and if adopted, could facilitate transactions among energy markets across the country. The SMD proposes that transmission owners would join Independent Transmission Providers, or ITPs, which would be independent of market participants, would have operational authority for all transmission assets under their control, and would perform certain functions related to day ahead and real time energy markets, determine resource adequacy requirements, financial congestion management, regional planning, market monitoring, and interregional coordination with neighboring ITPs. The Companys transmission facilities, other than those located underground, are currently controlled by the NYISO. In September 1997, the PSC approved a restructuring agreement among Con Edison of New York, PSC staff and certain other parties (the 1997 Restructuring Agreement). Pursuant to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, the Company reduced electric rates on an annual basis by $129 million in 1998, $80 million in 1999, $103 million in 2000 and $209 million in 2001, divested most of its electric generating capacity, and enabled all of its electric customers to choose to be served by competitive energy suppliers. 69 In November 2000, the PSC approved an October 2000 agreement (the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement) that, among other things, revised and extended the electric rate plan provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement and addressed certain generation divestiture related issues. The electric rate plan provisions of the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement cover the five year period ending March 2005. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company reduced the distribution component of its electric rates by $170 million on an annual basis, effective October 2000. The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement continues the rate provisions pursuant to which the Company recovers prudently incurred purchased power and fuel costs from customers. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. For additional information about the 1997 Restructuring Agreement and the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, see "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. Gas In April 2002, the PSC approved a Con Edison of New York gas rate agreement for the three year period ending September 30, 2004. The rate agreement reduces retail sales and transportation rates by $25 million, on an annual basis. In November 2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, PSC staff and certain other parties that revised and extended the 1996 gas rate settlement agreement through September 2001. The 1996 agreement, with limited exceptions, continued base rates at September 1996 levels through September 2000. For additional information, see "Rate and Restructuring" in Note A to the financial statements. Steam In December 2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, PSC staff and certain other parties with respect to the steam rate plan filed by the Company in November 1999. The agreement provides for a $16.6 million steam rate increase, which took effect October 2000 and, with limited exceptions, no further changes in steam rates prior to October 2004. For additional information about the agreement, see "Rate and Restructuring" in Note A to the financial statements. FINANCIAL MARKET RISKS Con Edison of New Yorks primary financial market risks are interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk. Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including utility construction expenditures and maturing debt securities. Con Edison of New York manages interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. The Company estimates that, as of December 31, 2002, a 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt of $615.3 million would result in a change in annual interest expense of $1.1 million. 70 In addition, the Company, from time to time, enters into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See "Interest Rate Hedging" in Note O to the financial statements. Commodity Price Risk Con Edison of New Yorks commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity and gas that the Company delivers to its customers. The Company has risk management strategies to mitigate its related exposure and uses derivative instruments to hedge this price risk. See "Energy Price Hedging" in Note O to the financial statements. Also, see Item 2 of this report for a discussion of the Companys generating capacity. In general, the rates the Company charges customers for electric, gas and steam service fluctuate with the cost of purchased power, gas purchased for resale and fuel used in the generation of steam and electricity, including gains or losses on certain derivative instruments and related transaction costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. The Company estimates that, as of December 31, 2002, a 10 percent change in market prices would result in a change in fair value of $5.7 million for the derivative instruments used by it to hedge purchases of electricity and gas. The Company expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. Credit Risk Con Edison of New York is exposed to credit risk related to over the counter transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities. Credit risk is the loss that may result from a counterpartys nonperformance. The Company uses credit policies to manage its credit risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, master netting agreements and credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, or prepayment arrangements. Investment Risk Con Edison of New Yorks investment risk relates to the investment of the assets in the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See "Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," above. ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES Con Edison of New York has not engaged to a material extent in trading activities that are accounted for at fair value. See "Financial Market Risks" above. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS For information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment, including the Superfund, and from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos, see Note F to the financial statements. IMPACT OF INFLATION Con Edison of New York is affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Company to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of its plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement 71 will substantially exceed historical cost. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companys long term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys results of operations (which were discussed above under "Results of Operations Summary") are discussed below for each of its business segments. The Companys principal business segments are its electric, gas and steam businesses. For additional information about its business segments, see Note L to the financial statements. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 Electric Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating revenues in 2002 decreased $575.2 million compared with 2001, reflecting primarily lower fuel and purchased power costs of $226.9 million (discussed below). The decrease also reflects the completion in March 2002 of amortizations of a previously deferred gain on the sale of divested plants and a previously deferred NYPA revenue increase ($43.3 million), a reserve established in 2002 for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return that are to be retained for customer benefit in accordance with the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement ($40.0 million), a reserve established in 2002 related to the sale of the Companys nuclear generating unit ($24.8 million), the amortization of the loss ($29.9 million) related to the sale of the Companys nuclear generating unit and rate reductions and other amortizations in accordance with the Companys rate agreements. The decrease in electric operating revenues was offset, in part, by an increase in electric sales revenues ($24.0 million) reflecting principally the hot summer weather. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" and "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note A to the financial statements. Electricity delivery volume in Con Edison of New Yorks service territory increased 1.6 percent in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase reflects the impact of the hot summer weather, offset in part, by the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, electricity delivery volume in the service territory increased 0.5 percent in the 2002 period. The Companys electric purchased power costs decreased $174.6 million in 2002 compared with 2001, due to a decrease in the price of purchased power and an increase in volumes of electricity purchased from other suppliers by participants in the retail access programs. This decrease was offset in part by the Companys increased purchased volumes resulting from the sale of the Companys nuclear generating unit in September 2001 and the hot summer weather in 2002. Fuel costs decreased $52.3 million as a result of decreased generation at Company owned power plants. In general, the Company recovers prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. The Companys electric operating income decreased $92.7 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The principal component of the decrease was lower net electric revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $348.3 million. The decrease in net electric revenues reflects the sale of the nuclear generation unit and the same factors (other than lower fuel and purchased power costs) as discussed above with respect to the decrease in electric operating income. The decrease in net electric 72 revenues was offset in part by reduced other operations and maintenance expenses ($136.8 million) reflecting nuclear production expenses incurred in 2001 but not in 2002, and productivity improvements, lower depreciation and amortization expense ($31.5 million) and lower revenue taxes ($26.2 million). The decrease is also offset by lower operating income tax of $61.8 million. Gas Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating revenues decreased $223.4 million, resulting primarily from the lower cost of purchased gas ($194.2 million) in 2002 compared with 2001. The lower cost of purchased gas reflects primarily lower unit costs. The lower revenues also reflect reduced sales volumes, resulting primarily from the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and revenue reductions implemented in accordance with the gas rate agreement approved by the PSC in April 2002. Gas operating income decreased $7.9 million in 2002, reflecting a $29.2 million decrease in net revenues (operating revenues less gas purchased for resale), and increased property tax expense ($9.6 million), offset in part by reduced operations and maintenance expenses ($16.2 million), reduced revenue taxes ($10.3 million) and lower income taxes ($8.7 million). Gas sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 3.5 percent in the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the Companys service territory decreased 1.5 percent in the 2002 period. The Companys gas sales and transportation volumes vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the winter. A weather normalization provision that applies to the Companys gas business moderates, but does not completely eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on gas operating income. Steam Con Edison of New Yorks steam operating revenues decreased $99.7 million. The lower revenues reflect reduced sales volumes and lower fuel and purchased power costs primarily as a result of the loss of the World Trade Center as a customer, the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy. The lower fuel and purchased power costs reflect primarily lower unit costs. Steam operating income increased $8.2 million for 2002 compared with 2001 due primarily to reduced operations and maintenance expenses of $9.3 million and lower income taxes of $10.5 million, offset in part by a decrease in net revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $11.1 million. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Steam sales volume decreased 3.2 percent in the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with the year ended December 31, 2001, reflecting primarily the loss of the World Trade Center as a customer, the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, steam sales volume decreased 1.4 percent. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes At $1.0 billion, taxes other than income taxes remain one of Con Edison of New Yorks largest operating expenses. 73 The principal components of, and variations in, operating taxes were: Increase/(Decrease) 2002 Amount 2002 compared to 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Property taxes $ 629.8 $ 9.4 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 326.9 (37.6 ) Payroll taxes 54.4 (1.7 ) Other taxes 28.3 2.0 Total $ 1,039.4 * $ (27.9 ) *Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customers in 2002 were $1,351.0 million. Effective in 2003, New York City increased the Companys annual property taxes by $96 million. Under the Companys rate agreements, the Company is deferring the property tax increase as a regulatory asset to be recovered from customers. Other Income Investment income decreased $4.1 million in 2002 compared to 2001, due principally to reduced interest income earned on short term cash investments in the 2002 period as compared to the 2001 period. For the 2001 period, the Company had more cash on hand than the 2002 period, primarily as a result of the sale of its nuclear generating unit. Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $8.2 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily reflecting the East River Repowering Project. Other income increased $41.7 million in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to $26.7 million of interest income on a federal income tax refund claim, a $10.2 million write off in 2001 of an investment in the New York Discovery Fund in 2001, a $9.4 million increase in interest earned on regulatory assets (See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities SFAS No. 71," above), offset in part by reduced income of $2.5 million from non utility operations. Income tax expense decreased $4.4 million in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to the recognition of tax benefits relating to the September 2001 sale of the Companys nuclear generating unit. Net Interest Charges Net interest charges increased $6.6 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2001. The increase reflects principally the interest expense associated with a net federal income tax deficiency related to a prior period audit ($19.1 million), partially offset by decreased interest expense on long term debt of $14.9 million. Income Tax Federal income tax decreased $28.6 million in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting lower income before tax and deductions related to removal costs and tax credits. In 2000, New York State implemented a tax law change that reduced or repealed certain revenue based taxes and replaced them with the imposition of a net income based tax. State income taxes decreased $56.8 million in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting lower income before tax, lowering of the tax rate and prior period adjustments. The state income tax expense is offset against the savings from the eliminated or reduced revenue taxes. Any over or under 74 collection of these taxes is deferred for return to, or recovery from, customers. See Notes A and L to the financial statements. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 Electric Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating revenues in 2001 decreased $116.7 million from 2000. The decrease in 2001 reflects decreased purchased power costs (see "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements) and electric rate reductions of $374.5 million, offset by economic growth and the effects of the warmer than normal summer weather when compared to cooler than normal weather for the 2000 period. Electricity sales volume in the Companys service territory increased 3.0 percent in 2001. The increase in sales volume reflects the warmer than normal summer weather and economic growth. The Companys electric sales vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the summer. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, in each period, electricity sales volume in Con Edison of New Yorks service territory increased 2.4 percent in 2001. The Companys electric operating income increased $90.5 million in 2001 compared with 2000. The increase in electric operating income was primarily comprised of an increase in net revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $63.6 million. The increase in net revenues reflects principally increased sales ($64.1 million), recognition of revenue related to previously deferred NYPA rate increases ($35.2 million), gain on the sale of divested generating plants ($37.5 million), increased revenues associated with system benefits charges ($32.8 million), recovery of incremental NUG cost ($31.0 million), reconciliation of state income tax and gross receipts tax ($110.8 million; see "Income Tax," below) and non recurring charges in 2000 for replacement power costs ($130.0 million), offset by electric rate reductions of $374.5 million. Electric operating income also increased due to decreased other operations and maintenance expenses of $108.4 million (discussed below) and decreased depreciation expense of $73.6 million, offset in part by increased property taxes of $33.7 million, federal income tax of $40.1 million and state income tax of $98.8 million (see "Income Tax," below). The $108.4 million decrease in other operations and maintenance expenses reflects principally lower expenses related to the Companys nuclear generating unit which was sold in September 2001 ($98.4 million), increased pension credits ($42.5 million) and decreased transmission expenses ($9.9 million), offset in part by higher distribution expenses for the relocation of Company facilities to avoid interference with municipal infrastructure projects ($13.4 million) and increased system benefits charges ($32.8 million). Gas Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating revenues increased $186.6 million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting increased cost of purchased gas, offset in part by a reduction in customers bills of $20.0 million, reflecting a refund of previously deferred credits and other provisions of the gas rate agreement approved by the PSC in November 2000. Operating income in 2001 increased $1.6 million compared with 2000, reflecting an increase in net revenues (operating revenues less gas purchased for resale) of $11.2 million and increased pension credits of $8.2 million, offset in part by increased depreciation and 75 amortization expense ($3.9 million), increased state income tax ($8.2 million; see "Income Tax" below), increased uncollectible account write offs ($1.9 million) and higher distribution expenses for the relocation of Company facilities to avoid interference with municipal infrastructure projects ($3.0 million). Gas sales and transportation volume to firm customers decreased 0.4 percent in 2001 compared with 2000. The Companys gas sales and transportation volumes vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the winter. The decrease in volume in 2001 compared with 2000 reflects the warmer 2001 winter compared with 2000. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, in each period, gas sales and transportation volume to firm customers increased 2.8 percent in 2001. Steam Con Edison of New Yorks steam operating revenues increased $51.6 million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting primarily increased purchased steam and fuel costs (see "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements). Steam operating income increased $2.3 million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting an October 2000 rate increase of $16.6 million. Steam sales volume decreased 5.3 percent in 2001 and increased 0.8 percent in 2000. The decrease in 2001 reflects the mild 2001 winter weather compared with 2000. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, in each period, steam sales volume decreased 2.7 percent in 2001. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes The principal components of and variations in operating taxes were: Increase/(Decrease) 2001 Amount 2001 compared to 2000 (Millions of Dollars) Property taxes $ 620.4 $ 33.6 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 364.5 (19.2 ) Payroll taxes 56.2 1.1 Other taxes 26.3 3.5 Total $ 1,067.4 * $ 19.0 *Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customers in 2001 were $1,414.4 million. Other Income Other income increased $0.9 million in 2001 compared with 2000, due principally to deferred federal income tax credits realized, offset by a write off in 2001 of an investment of $10.2 million in the New York City Discovery Fund. Net Interest Charges Net interest charges increased $16.0 million in 2001, compared with 2000, reflecting principally $28.4 million of increased interest expense for Con Edison of New York related to long term borrowings, offset in part by a decrease of $8.4 million related to short term borrowings and $7.0 million of interest accrued on the net after tax gain from generation divestiture prior to regulatory disposition of the gain in 2000. See Note I to the financial statements. 76 Income Tax Federal income tax increased $19.7 million in 2001, reflecting the change in income before tax, deductions related to removal costs and tax credits. State income taxes increased $117.5 million in 2001 compared with 2000 as the result of the change in New York State tax law, offset by a corresponding increase in other operating revenues for taxes no longer applicable but still being recovered through rates. See Notes A and J to the financial statements. 77  MANAGEMENTS NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ORANGE AND ROCKLAND UTILITIES, INC. Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R or the Company), a wholly owned subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison), meets the conditions specified in General Instruction I of Form 10 K and is permitted to use the reduced disclosure format for wholly owned subsidiaries of companies, like Con Edison, that are reporting companies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, this O&R Managements Narrative Analysis of Results of Operations is included in this report, and O&R has omitted from this report the information called for by Part II, Item 7 of Form 10 K (Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). This narrative analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of O&R and its subsidiaries and the notes thereto. Information in the notes referred to in this narrative analysis is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as "see" or "refer to" shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this narrative analysis the information to which reference is made. O&RS BUSINESS O&R is a regulated utility that, along with its regulated utility subsidiaries, provides electric service to over 285,000 customers in southeastern New York and in adjacent sections of New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania and gas service to over 120,000 customers in southeastern New York and northeastern Pennsylvania. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY O&Rs net income for common stock for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $44.9 million, $4.7 million higher than the corresponding 2001 period. The increase in the Companys net income was attributable primarily to higher electric sales volumes due to warmer than normal weather, customer growth and higher average usage, which produced an additional $7.3 million of net electric revenues (operating revenues less purchased power costs). While firm gas volumes were down slightly, gas net revenues increased by $0.8 million due primarily to incentives earned from interruptible and off system gas sales. Income taxes and revenue taxes decreased by $3.2 million due to lowered tax rates in New York. The higher net revenues and lower taxes were partially offset by $4.9 million in higher interest charges that resulted from a change by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) to the carrying charges allowed on the Companys deferred purchased power balance in New Jersey. This expense was offset in part by lower net financing costs of $1.4 million. Operation and maintenance costs increased by $1.2 million and depreciation charges were $1.2 million higher. See "Results of Operations Business Segments" below for further analysis of earnings. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES O&Rs financial statements reflect the application of its accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companys critical accounting policies include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits and contingencies. 78 The application of certain of these accounting policies requires the Company to use estimates. These estimates require the Company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and for which different estimates that could reasonably have been used could have resulted in material differences in its financial statements. Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities SFAS No. 71 O&R is a regulated public utility subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, is subject to the accounting requirements and rate making practices of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction. SFAS No. 71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under SFAS No. 71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under SFAS No. 71. O&Rs principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The Company is receiving or being credited with a return on all of its regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Company is paying or being charged with a return on all of its regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Companys regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits O&R and its subsidiaries provide pension and other postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and retirees. The Company accounts for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions." In applying these accounting policies, the Company has made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, future compensation and health care cost trends, and appropriate discount rates. See Notes D and E to the financial statements for information about these assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2002, 2001 and 2000. Plan expense or credit in future periods will depend on the assumptions the Company makes and the actual performance of the pension fund. In accordance with SFAS No. 71 and consistent with rate provisions approved by the applicable state public utility authorities, O&R defers as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability, any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No. 87 and the amounts reflected in rates for such expenses. An actuarial valuation of Con Edisons pension plans funded status (which applies to both Con Edison of New York and O&R) was performed as of December 31, 2002. The valuation showed that the fair value 79 of the pension plan assets exceeded its Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) at December 31, 2002. However, the fair market value of Con Edisons pension plan assets could fall below the plans ABO in future years. In that event, O&R would be required, under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pension and Postretirement Benefits," to accrue a liability equal in the amount to the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the ABO, less its accrued pension liability through a charge to other comprehensive income (OCI). The charge to OCI, which would be net of taxes, would not affect O&Rs net income. Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," applies to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Companys known material contingencies include workers compensation claims, and its responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, that have been used or generated in the course of its operations. See Note F to the financial statements. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, the Company has accrued estimates of its losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys results of operations (which were discussed above under "Results of Operations Summary") are discussed below for each of its business segments. The Companys principal business segments are its electric and gas utility businesses. For additional information about its business segments, see Note P to the financial statements. Electric Electric operating revenues decreased $62.9 million during 2002 compared to 2001. This decrease was primarily the result of lower purchased power costs and tax recoveries in 2002. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Electric sales volumes in 2002 increased 5.8 percent compared to 2001 due to warmer than normal summer weather, customer growth and higher average usage. After adjusting for weather variations, total electricity sales volumes were 3.2 percent higher in 2002. Net electric revenues (operating revenues less purchased power) were $7.3 million higher in 2002 than in 2001. Purchased power costs decreased $70.2 million during 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting decreases in the unit cost of purchased power and increased volumes of electricity purchased by customers from other suppliers, partially offset by higher energy usage by full service customers. Electric operating income increased $7.3 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. This increase reflects the impact of higher net electric revenues along with lower New York state and local income and revenue taxes, offset in part by higher operation and maintenance charges and depreciation costs. 80 Gas Gas operating revenues decreased $39.0 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. This decrease was primarily the result of lower gas costs and sales to firm customers in 2002. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Total firm gas sales volumes in 2002 decreased 1.1 percent compared to 2001. Revenues from gas sales in New York are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. After adjusting for weather variations in each period, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 0.3 percent lower for 2002 compared to 2001. Net gas revenues (operating revenues less purchased gas) were $0.7 million higher in 2002 due primarily to incentives earned from interruptible and off system gas sales. The cost of gas purchased for resale was $39.8 million less in 2002 than in 2001, reflecting lower sales volumes and unit costs. Decreased gas revenues also reflect the reduced requirement for the Company to buy gas for resale because of an increase in the purchase of gas by customers from other suppliers. Gas operating income increased by $1.4 million in 2002, compared to 2001, due primarily to higher net revenues and lower operations and maintenance expenses, offset in part by lower late payment charge revenues and higher depreciation. Other Operations and Maintenance Other operations and maintenance expense increased $1.2 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase was attributable primarily to higher electric transmission and distribution expenditures, partially offset by lower customer bad debt and collections expense. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes decreased by $1.5 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The decrease was primarily the result of lower New York State revenue taxes of $2.7 million, which resulted from reduced tax rates and lower energy costs billed to customers. Partially offsetting this decrease were higher property taxes of $0.9 million. The principal components of, and variations, in operating taxes were: Increase/(Decrease) 2002 Amount 2002 compared to 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Property taxes $ 27.3 $ 0.9 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 21.2 (2.7 ) Payroll taxes 3.8 0.1 Other taxes 0.1 0.2 Total $ 52.4 * $ (1.5 ) * Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes, billed to customers in 2002 was $70.8 million. 81 Net Interest Charges Interest charges increased by $4.1 million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily as a result of a change by the NJBPU in the carrying charges allowed on the Companys deferred purchased power balance in New Jersey ($4.9 million) and lower allowance for borrowed funds used during construction ($0.6 million). These expenses were offset in part by lower net financing costs of $1.4 million that resulted from lower average debt balances and interest rates in 2002. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased by $1.6 million in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting primarily lower state income taxes. State income taxes decreased primarily as a result of a 0.5 percent reduction in the New York State tax rate. Excluding certain taxes in New York that are reconciled to amounts included in rates, income taxes increased by $1.7 million due primarily to higher operating income in 2002. 82  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Con Edison For information about Con Edisons primary market risks associated with activities in derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments, see "Financial Market Risks" in Con Edisons MD&A in Item 7 (which information is incorporated herein by reference). Con Edison of New York For information about Con Edison of New Yorks primary market risks associated with activities in derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments, see "Financial Market Risks" in Con Edison of New Yorks MD&A in Item 7 (which information is incorporated herein by reference). O&R O&Rs primary financial market risks are interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk. Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including utility construction expenditures and maturing debt securities. O&R and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. The Company estimates that, as of December 31, 2002, a 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt of $45.0 million would result in a change in annual interest expense of $0.1 million. In addition, O&R and its subsidiaries from time to time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See Note P to the financial statements. Commodity Price Risk O&Rs commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity and gas that the Company delivers to its customers. The Company has risk management strategies to mitigate its related exposure and uses derivative instruments to hedge this price risk. See Note P to the financial statements. In general, the rates O&R and its subsidiaries charge customers for electric and gas service fluctuate with the cost of purchased power, gas purchased for resale and fuel used in the generation of electricity, including gains or losses on certain derivative instruments and related transaction costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. O&R estimates that, as of December 31, 2002, a 10 percent change in market prices would result in a change in fair value of $1.7 million for the derivative instruments used by it to hedge purchases of electricity and gas. The Company expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. Credit Risk O&R is exposed to credit risk related to over the counter transactions entered into primarily for various energy supply and hedging activities. Credit risk is the loss that may result from a counterpartys 83 nonperformance. The Company uses credit policies to manage its credit risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, master netting agreements, and credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, or prepayment arrangements. Investment Risk O&Rs investment risk relates to the investment of the assets in the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See "Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," in Part II Item 7. 84
