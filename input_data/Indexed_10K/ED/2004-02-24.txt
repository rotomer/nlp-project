ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) This discussion and analysis relate to the consolidated financial statements of Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison), Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York) and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R) and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto. Con Edison of New York and O&R, which are regulated utilities, are subsidiaries of Con Edison and are referred to in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) as the "Utilities." The Utilities, together with Con Edison, are referred to in this MD&A as the "Companies." Neither Con Edison of New York nor O&R makes any representation as to information in this report relating to Con Edison or the subsidiaries of Con Edison other than itself. Information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements referred to in this discussion and analysis is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as "see" or "refer to" shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made.  CORPORATE OVERVIEW Con Edisons principal business operations are those of the Utilities. Con Edison also has unregulated subsidiaries that compete in energy related and telecommunications industries. Certain financial data of Con Edisons subsidiaries is presented below: Twelve months ended December 31, 2003 At December 31, 2003 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues Net Income Assets Con Edison of New York $ 8,166 83 % $ 591 112 % $ 17,764 85 % O&R 727 7 % 45 9 % 1,269 6 % Total Utilities 8,893 90 % 636 121 % 19,033 91 % Con Edison Communications 19 % (108 )(b) (20 )% 35 (b) % Con Edison Development 303 3 % (9 )(b) (2 )% 1,275 (b) 6 % Con Edison Energy 54 1 % 1 % 117 % Con Edison Solutions 578 6 % 19 3 % 127 1 % Other(a) (20 ) % (11 ) (2 )% 379 2 % Total Con Edison $ 9,827 100 % $ 528 100 % $ 20,966 100 % (a)Represents inter company and parent company accounting. (b)Reflects impairment charges discussed below. Con Edisons net income for common stock in 2003 was $528 million or $2.39 a share. Net income for common stock in 2002 and 2001 was $646 million or $3.03 a share and $682 million or $3.22 a share, 32 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED respectively. Included in 2003 net income for common stock were impairment charges for certain unregulated telecommunications and generating assets ($94 million after tax or $0.43 per share) and the impact of a regulatory settlement ($5 million after tax charge or $0.03 per share), partially offset by the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles ($3 million after tax gain or $0.02 per share). Included in the 2002 results was the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles ($22 million after tax charges or $0.11 per share). For additional segment financial information, see Note O to the financial statements and "Results of Operations," below. The Companies are each subject to certain material contingencies, including certain Utility environmental matters and Con Edisons legal proceedings relating to its October 1999 agreement to acquire Northeast Utilities. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies," below. Regulated Utility Subsidiaries Con Edison of New York provides electric service to over 3.1 million customers and gas service to 1.1 million customers in New York City and Westchester County. The company also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. O&R, along with its regulated utility subsidiaries, provides electric service to over 285,000 customers in southeastern New York and adjacent sections of New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania and gas service to over 120,000 customers in southeastern New York and northeastern Pennsylvania. The Utilities are primarily "wires and pipes" energy delivery companies that are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. Pursuant to restructuring agreements, the Utilities have sold most of their electric generating capacity and provide their customers the opportunity to buy electricity and gas directly from other suppliers through the Utilities retail access programs. The Utilities supply more than half of the energy delivered by them in their service areas and provide delivery service to their customers that buy energy from other suppliers. The Utilities purchase substantially all of the energy they supply to customers pursuant to firm contracts or through wholesale energy markets. In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full service customers, pursuant to approved rate plans. Con Edison anticipates that the Utilities will provide substantially all of its earnings over the next few years. The Utilities earnings will depend on various factors including demand for utility service and the Utilities ability to charge rates for their services that reflect the costs of service, including a return on invested equity capital. Demand for utility service is affected by weather, economic conditions and other factors. The Utilities have experienced increased customer demand in recent years. In June, July and August of 2002, both Con 33 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Edison of New York and O&R set new three month electric delivery records of more than 17 million and 1.7 million megawatt hours, respectively. In June 2003, Con Edison of New York and O&R each experienced a new record electric peak load for that month. The June peak was an all time peak electric load for O&R. In January 2004, Con Edison of New York and O&R each experienced a new winter electricity peak load. Because the energy delivery infrastructure must be adequate to meet demand in peak periods with a high level of reliability, the Utilities capital investment plans reflect in great part actual growth in electric peak load adjusted to summer design weather conditions, as well as forecast growth in peak loads. On this basis, Con Edison of New Yorks weather adjusted peak load in the summer of 2003 was 12,600 MW, 1.6 percent higher than the adjusted peak load in 2002. The forecast annual growth in the electric peak load over the next five years is 1.6 percent. The company anticipates an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to meet this load growth with the exceptionally high level of reliability that it currently provides (see "Capital Requirements," below). The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the rates they can charge their customers. Con Edison of New York has an electric rate agreement (approved in November 2000) that ends March 2005 and gas and steam rate agreements (approved in April 2002 and November 2000, respectively) that end in September 2004. These agreements do not reflect all of the increased construction expenditures and related costs incurred and expected to be incurred to meet increasing customer demand and reliability needs that have been experienced since the date of those agreements (see "Capital Requirements," below). The company filed petitions in November 2003 to increase rates for gas and steam service effective October 2004 and expects to file a petition in April 2004 to increase rates for electric service effective April 2005. O&R has rate agreements for its electric and gas services in New York that extend through October 2006. The rate plans generally require the Utilities to share with customers earnings in excess of specified rates of return on equity. Changes in energy sales and delivery volumes are reflected in operating income (except to the extent that weather normalization provisions apply to the gas businesses). Rates charged to customers, pursuant to these agreements, may not be changed during the respective terms of these agreements other than for recovery of energy costs and limited other exceptions. See "Regulatory Matters" below and "Recoverable Energy Costs" and "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Notes A and B, respectively, to the financial statements. Accounting rules and regulations for public utilities include Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," pursuant to which the economic effects of rate regulation are reflected in financial statements. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies," below. The respective collective bargaining agreements covering about two thirds of each of the Utilities employees expire in June 2004. 34 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Unregulated Businesses Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries participate in competitive businesses and are subject to different risks than the Utilities. In view of conditions affecting certain of its competitive activities, the company recognized impairment charges of $159 million ($94 million after tax) for its unregulated telecommunications and generation businesses in the fourth quarter of 2003. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies," below and Note H to the financial statements. At December 31, 2003, Con Edisons investment in its unregulated subsidiaries was $703 million and the unregulated subsidiaries assets amounted to $1.6 billion, including $339 million related to Con Edison Developments Newington project. See Note T to the financial statements. Consolidated Edison Solutions, Inc. (Con Edison Solutions) sells electricity and gas to delivery customers of Con Edison of New York, O&R and other utilities and also offers energy related services. As of December 31, 2003, the company served approximately 30,000 electric customers with an estimated aggregate peak load of 1,400 MW. Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. (Con Edison Development) owns and operates generating plants and energy and other infrastructure projects. At December 31, 2003, the company owned interests of 1,668 MW of capacity in electric generating facilities of which 244 MW are sold under long term purchase power agreements and the balance is sold on the wholesale electricity markets. Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc. (Con Edison Energy) provides energy and capacity to Con Edison Solutions and others and markets the output of plants owned or operated by Con Edison Development. The company also provides risk management services to Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison Development and offers these services to others. Con Edison Communications, LLC (Con Edison Communications) builds and operates fiber optic networks to provide telecommunications services. The companys properties (the capitalized cost of which at December 31, 2003 amounted to $30 million, net of the impairment charge discussed above and in Note H to the financial statements) include network facilities and nearly 400 miles of fiber optic cable that has been installed in the New York City metropolitan area primarily through Con Edison of New Yorks underground conduits and other rights of way. Con Edison is evaluating strategic alternatives for its telecommunications business. Con Edison anticipates investing $59 million in its unregulated businesses over the next two years and will focus on maximizing the value of their existing assets. See "Capital Requirements" and "Capital Resources," below. Results of Operations Summary Con Edisons earnings per share in 2003 were $2.39 ($2.38 on a diluted basis). Earnings per share in 2002 and 2001 were $3.03 ($3.02 on a diluted basis) and $3.22 ($3.21 on a diluted basis). 35 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Earnings per share for 2003 and 2002, before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $3 million and $(22) million after tax, respectively, were $2.37 ($2.36 on a diluted basis) and $3.14 ($3.13 on a diluted basis), respectively.

The Companies critical accounting policies include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases. The critical accounting policies are as follows: Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities SFAS No. 71 The Utilities are subject to SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, are subject to the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction. SFAS No. 71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under SFAS No. 71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under SFAS No. 71. The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in Note B to the financial statements. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries also provide such benefits to certain of their employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions." In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, future compensation, health care cost trends and appropriate discount rates. See Notes E and F to the financial statements for information about these assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2003, 2002 and 2001. 38 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Primarily because of the amortization of previous years net investment gains, Con Edison of New Yorks pension expense for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was negative, resulting in a credit to and increase in net income in each year. Investment gains and losses on plan assets are fully recognized in expense over a 15 year period (20 percent of the gains and losses for each year begin to amortize in each of the following five years and the amortization period for each 20 percent portion of the gains and losses is ten years). This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the New York Public Service Commission (PSC) and is permitted under SFAS No. 87. The cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets and assumptions for future periods. Con Edisons current estimate for 2004 is a reduction, compared with 2003, in the pension and other postretirement benefits net credit of $19 million after tax for Con Edison of New York and an increase, compared to 2003, in pension and other postretirement benefits expense of $1 million for O&R. This reduction reflects, among other factors, the amortization of prior period actuarial losses associated with declines in the market value of assets in recent years, partially offset by the amortization of a gain on plan assets in 2003 and by the estimated impact in 2004 of recently enacted Medicare legislation (reduction in other postretirement benefit costs of $10 million after tax, including $9 million for Con Edison of New York and $1 million for O&R). Amortization of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to reduce Con Edison of New Yorks pension and other post retirement benefit net credit by an additional $25 million, after tax, in 2005. A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2004 as compared with the expected annual asset return of 8.8 percent would change net income for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York by approximately $5 million in 2005, assuming no change in regulatory treatment. In accordance with SFAS No. 71 and consistent with rate provisions approved by the PSC, O&R defers as a regulatory asset any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No. 87 and the amounts reflected in rates for such expenses. Con Edison of New Yorks pending petitions for gas and steam rate increases include, and the company anticipates that its petition for an electric rate increase will include, a proposal for deferred accounting treatment of such expenses. See "Regulatory Matters", below. Pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which Con Edison of New York, O&R and the unregulated subsidiaries make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets. An actuarial valuation of the plans funded status as of December 31, 2003, showed that the fair value of the plans assets exceeded, by $712 million, the plans accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) at that date. However, the fair market value of the plan assets could fall below the plans ABO in future years. In that event, each of the Utilities would be required, under SFAS No. 87, to accrue a liability equal in amount to the difference between its share of the fair value of the plan assets and its portion of the ABO, plus, in the case of Con Edison of 39 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED New York, its total prepaid pension costs, through a non cash charge to other comprehensive income (OCI). The charge to OCI, which would be net of taxes, would not affect net income for common stock. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to their pension plans in 2003 under funding regulations and tax laws. O&R made a discretionary contribution of $18 million to the plan in 2003. In 2004, O&R and Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries expect to make discretionary contributions of $22 million and $2 million, respectively. The Companies policy is to fund its accounting cost to the extent it is tax deductible. Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," applies to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies include the Utilities responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations, workers compensation claims and Con Edisons legal proceedings relating to its October 1999 merger agreement with Northeast Utilities. See Notes G, K, Q, R, S, T and W to the financial statements. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated. Accounting for Long Lived Assets SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under SFAS No. 144 an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value. The adverse market conditions affecting Con Edisons unregulated telecommunications and generation businesses led to the testing of their assets for impairment in 2003. A critical element of this test is the forecast of future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the long lived assets. Forecast of these cash flows requires complex judgments about future operations, which are particularly difficult to make with respect to evolving industries such as the energy related and telecommunications businesses. Under SFAS No. 144, if alternative courses of action are under consideration or if a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows, the probability of those possible outcomes must be weighted. As a result of the tests performed in 2003, Con Edison recognized impairment charges of $159 million 40 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED ($94 million after tax) for the assets of its unregulated telecommunications and generation businesses. See Note H to the financial statements. Accounting for Derivative Instruments The Companies apply SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, and other related accounting pronouncements to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See "Financial and Commodity Market Risks" below and Note P to the financial statements. Accounting for Goodwill Con Edison adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. In accordance with this standard, Con Edison ceased amortizing goodwill and began testing remaining goodwill balances for impairment on an annual basis. Con Edison completed initial goodwill impairment tests and recorded a loss of $34.1 million ($20.2 million after tax) as of January 1, 2002, relating to certain generation assets owned by an unregulated subsidiary. The unamortized goodwill of $405.8 million, relating to the acquisition of O&R, was tested for impairment and determined not to be impaired. See Note L to the financial statements. In determining whether or not its goodwill is impaired, Con Edison is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that could affect the results of the goodwill impairment test. Actual results could differ from the estimates used. Accounting for Leases The Companies apply SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases" and other related accounting pronouncements to their leasing transactions. See Notes K and T to the financial statements.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below. The principal factors affecting Con Edisons liquidity at the holding company level are its investments in the Utilities, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities. In addition, in 2003 Con Edison issued 11.9 million shares of common stock for $431 million ($381 million of which it invested in Con Edison of New York) and $200 million of five year debt. In 2002, the company issued $325 million of 40 year debt (most of which it invested in its unregulated subsidiaries). The principal factors affecting the Utilities liquidity are the cash flow generated from operations, construction expenditures and maturities of their debt securities. In addition, Con Edison of New York in 2003 received a $381 million capital contribution from Con Edison; in 2002 and 2001 issued $225 million and $95 million, respectively, of additional debt net of redemptions; and in 2001 received 41 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED net proceeds of $597 million from the sale of generating assets, net of a contribution to its nuclear decommissioning trust (see Note J to the financial statements). Also, since 2001, Con Edison of New York has incurred substantial, primarily capital, costs in connection with the attack on the World Trade Center and the subsequent restoration of lower Manhattan and to date has received reimbursement of such costs of $29 million from the federal government (see Note R to the financial statements). In 2003, O&R redeemed $35 million of debt at maturity with commercial paper. The Companies each believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short term and long term cash requirements, assuming that the Utilities rate plans reflect their costs of service, including a return on invested capital. See "Regulatory Matters," below and "Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies," above. Changes in the Companies cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 are summarized as follows:  CON EDISON (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 Variance 2003 vs. 2002 2001 Variance 2002 vs. 2001 Operating activities $ 1,319 $ 1,522 $ (203 ) $ 1,587 $ (65 ) Investing activities (1,527 ) (1,634 ) 107 (941 ) (693 ) Financing activities 143 (115 ) 258 (382 ) 267 Net change for the period (65 ) (227 ) 162 264 (491 ) Balance at beginning of period 132 359 (227 ) 95 264 Balance at end of period (including restricted cash) $ 67 $ 132 $ (65 ) $ 359 $ (227 )  CON EDISON OF NEW YORK (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 Variance 2003 vs. 2002 2001 Variance 2002 vs. 2001 Operating activities $ 1,169 $ 1,310 $ (141 ) $ 1,306 $ 4 Investing activities (1,337 ) (1,273 ) (64 ) (569 ) (704 ) Financing activities 113 (214 ) 327 (542 ) 328 Net change for the period (55 ) (177 ) 122 195 (372 ) Balance at beginning of period 88 265 (177 ) 70 195 Balance at end of period (including restricted cash) $ 33 $ 88 $ (55 ) $ 265 $ (177 ) 42 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED  O&R (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 Variance 2003 vs. 2002 2001 Variance 2002 vs. 2001 Operating activities $ 128 $ 104 $ 24 $ 107 $ (3 ) Investing activities (71 ) (60 ) (11 ) (61 ) 1 Financing activities (49 ) (44 ) (5 ) (52 ) 8 Net change for the period 8 8 (6 ) 6 Balance at beginning of period 2 2 8 (6 ) Balance at end of period (including restricted cash) $ 10 $ 2 $ 8 $ 2 $ Cash Flows from Operating Activities The Utilities cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is dependent primarily on factors external to the Utilities, such as weather and economic conditions. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with rate plans approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction the PSC, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC). See "Regulatory Matters" below. In general, changes in the Utilities cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Net income for common stock is the result of cash and non cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies cash flows from operating activities. Principal non cash charges include depreciation and deferred taxes, and for Con Edison in 2003, impairment charges. For Con Edison of New York, principal non cash credits include prepaid pension costs. Pension credits result from past favorable performance in Con Edison of New Yorks pension fund and assumptions about future performance. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits" and Notes E and F to the financial statements. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2003 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $203 million and $141 million lower than 2002, respectively. This decrease reflects lower net income at Con Edison of New York (due to a certain extent to costs not reflected in current rates) and for Con Edison (due to greater losses at the unregulated subsidiaries). This decrease also reflects Con Edison of New Yorks increase in the value of gas in storage (reflecting both higher unit costs and higher volumes) and a higher level of accrued construction commitments at year end 2002 that were paid for in 2003. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in deferred income tax expense. 43 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Net cash flows from operating activities in 2003 for O&R were $24 million higher than in 2002 due primarily to increased deferred income tax expense, partially offset by the increased value of gas in storage (resulting from higher unit costs and volumes). Net cash flows from operating activities in 2002 for Con Edison were $65 million lower than in 2001. This decrease was due principally to higher energy costs and sales at the Utilities in December 2002 as compared with December 2001, resulting in increased customer accounts receivable and recoverable energy costs, offset in part by increased accounts payable balances. The net benefit to cash flows from these activities in 2001 was greater than the benefit in 2002 because high energy costs at year end 2000 were collected in 2001 and energy purchases at year end 2001 were lower than the prior year. The change in cash flows also reflects the timing of federal income tax payments and refunds for the Utilities and net cash received related to regulatory liabilities, such as transmission congestion contracts, offset by increased cash expended related to regulatory assets. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2002 for Con Edison of New York were $4 million higher than in 2001. The change in cash flows reflects the aforementioned impact of the timing of energy sales and cost recovery, the timing of federal income tax payments and refunds, and cash received or expended related to regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets, respectively. Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison were $107 million lower in 2003 than in 2002, due primarily to lower construction expenditures by its unregulated subsidiaries, partially offset by increased construction expenditures by the Utilities. Cash flows used in investing activities were $64 million and $11 million higher in 2003 than in 2002 for Con Edison of New York and O&R, respectively, due primarily to increased construction expenditures. Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $693 million and $704 million higher in 2002 compared with 2001, respectively, due primarily to the receipt in 2001 of net proceeds from generation divestiture. See Note J to the financial statements. In addition, Con Edison of New York construction expenditures increased in 2002 compared with 2001, principally to meet load growth on the companys electric distribution system, to effect permanent restoration of portions of the electric, gas and steam systems in lower Manhattan following the World Trade Center attack and for the ongoing project to add incremental generating capacity at Con Edison of New Yorks East River steam electric generating plant (the East River Repowering Project). Deferred real estate sale costs related to the demolition and remediation of a nine acre development site in midtown Manhattan along the East River were $134 million at December 31, 2002, compared with $105 million at December 31, 2001. In 2000, Con Edison of New York agreed to sell this site for an expected price of $576 million to $680 million, depending on zoning and other adjustments. The sale is subject to PSC approval and other conditions. The buyer paid Con Edison of New York $50 million in 44 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED 2000 as a down payment, which Con Edison used to fund a portion of the demolition and remediation expenses. The down payment has been recorded as a regulatory liability. Net cash flows used in investing activities for O&R were $1 million lower in 2002 than in 2001. Cash Flows from/(used in) Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities in 2003 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York increased $258 million and $327 million, respectively in 2003 compared with 2002. Con Edisons cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003, reflect the issuance of 9.6 million Con Edison common shares (resulting in proceeds of $381 million, which was invested by Con Edison in Con Edison of New York) and $200 million of Con Edisons 3.625 percent 5 year Series 2003A Debentures (most of which was invested in the unregulated subsidiaries). Cash flows from financing activities in 2002 reflect the issuance of $325 million of Con Edisons 7.25 percent 40 year Series 2002A Debentures (the proceeds of which were used to repay commercial paper). Cash flows from financing activities in both 2003 and 2002 also reflect the issuance of Con Edison common shares through its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans (2003: 2.3 million shares for $50 million; 2002: 1.7 million shares for $25 million). In addition, common stock dividends paid in 2003 and 2002 were reduced by $46 million and $44 million, respectively, to reflect the amount of dividends reinvested in Con Edison common shares through the dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans. Net cash flows used in financing activities for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York decreased $267 million and $328 million in 2002 compared with 2001, respectively. This decrease reflects principally increased debt financing for construction expenditures at Con Edison of New York and a reduction in the dividends paid by Con Edison of New York to Con Edison. In addition, in September 2001, Con Edison of New York used the proceeds from the sale of its nuclear plant to repay outstanding short term borrowing. Net cash flows used in financing activities for O&R were $8 million lower in 2002 than 2001, due primarily to the retirement of short term debt in excess of proceeds from issuances. Net cash flows from financing activities during the years ending December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 also reflect Con Edison of New Yorks (unless otherwise noted) refunding and issuance of long term debt and preferred stock as follows: 2003 Redeemed in advance of maturity $275 million 7.75 percent 35 year Series 1996A, Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures using cash held for that purpose at December 31, 2002; Redeemed at maturity $150 million of 6.375 percent 10 year Series 1993D Debentures and issued $175 million 5.875 percent 30 year Series 2003A Debentures; 45  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Redeemed $380 million 7.5 percent 30 year Series 1993G Debentures using the net proceeds from the issuance of $200 million 3.85 percent 10 year Series 2003B Debentures and $200 million 5.10 percent 30 year Series 2003C Debentures; O&R redeemed at maturity its $35 million 6.56 percent 10 year Series 1993D Debentures using proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. 2002 Redeemed at maturity $150 million 6.625 percent 9 year Series 1993C; Redeemed at maturity $150 million variable rate 5 year Series 1997A and issued $300 million of 5.625 percent 10 year Series 2002A Debentures; Redeemed at maturity $37 million of Cumulative Preferred Stock $100 par value 6.125 percent Series J; Issued $500 million of 4.875 percent 10 year Series 2002B Debentures. 2001 Redeemed at maturity $150 million 6.5 percent 10 year Series 1993B; Issued $400 million 7.5 percent 40 year Series 2001A; Issued $225 million variable rate 35 year tax exempt debt Series 2001A through the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and redeemed in advance of maturity $128 million 7.5 percent 25 year Series 1991A and $100 million 6.75 percent 25 year Series 1992A NYSERDA bonds; Issued $98 million variable rate 35 year tax exempt debt through NYSERDA and redeemed in advance of maturity $100 million 6.375 percent 25 year Series 1992B NYSERDA bonds; Redeemed at maturity $150 million variable rate 5 year Series 1996B. In 2002, Con Edison of New York changed the interest rate method applicable to $224.6 million aggregate principal amount of its tax exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2001A from a variable weekly rate mode to a 10 year term mode, callable at par after three years with a 4.7 percent annual interest rate. In addition, Con Edison of New York entered into a swap agreement in connection with these bonds pursuant to which the company pays interest at a variable rate equal to the three month LIBOR and is paid interest at a fixed rate of 5.375 percent. See Note P to the financial statements. Cash flows from financing activities of the Companies also reflect commercial paper issuance (included on the consolidated balance sheets as "Notes payable"). The commercial paper amounts outstanding at 46 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and the average daily balance for 2003, 2002 and 2001 for Con Edison, Con Edison of New York and O&R were as follows: 2003 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars, except Weighted Average Yield) Outstanding at December 31 Daily average Outstanding at December 31 Daily average Outstanding at December 31 Daily average Con Edison $ 156 $ 326 $ 151 $ 256 $ 176 $ 242 Con Edison of New York $ 99 $ 179 $ $ 157 $ 164 O&R $ 15 $ 33 $ 1 $ 1 $ 17 $ 28 Weighted average yield 1.0 % 1.2 % 1.2 % 1.7 % 2.0 % 4.6 % External borrowings are a source of liquidity that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital markets. For information about the Companies credit rating and certain financial ratios, see "Capital Resources," below. In January 2004, Con Edison of New York issued $245.3 million of its variable rate, tax exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2004A and B, the proceeds of which are being used to redeem in advance of maturity its fixed rate, tax exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 1993A, B and C. In February 2004, Con Edison of New York issued $200 million of 4.7 percent 10 year Series 2004A Debentures and $200 million of 5.7 percent 30 year Series 2004B Debentures, the proceeds of which were used to redeem in advance of maturity the companys $150 million 7.125 percent Series 1994A Debentures and for general corporate purposes. Changes in Assets and Liabilities The following table shows changes in assets and liabilities at December 31, 2003, compared with December 31, 2002, that have impacted the Companies consolidated statements of cash flows. The changes in these balances are utilized to reconcile income to cash flow from operations. With respect to regulatory liabilities, see Note B to the financial statements. (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison 2003 vs. 2002 Variance Con Edison of New York 2003 vs. 2002 Variance O&R 2003 vs. 2002 Variance Accounts receivable customers, less allowance for uncollectible accounts $ 107 $ 90 $ 3 Gas in storage 69 52 13 Prepaid pension costs 233 233 Accounts payable (20 ) (30 ) 11 Superfund and other environmental liabilities 50 45 5 Deferred income taxes liability 391 333 44 Regulatory liabilities transmission congestion contracts 159 159 47 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Accounts receivable customers, less allowance for uncollectible accounts increased due primarily to higher electric and gas sales revenue for the Utilities and higher electric purchased power and gas unit costs (which are recoverable from customers) for Con Edison of New York during December 2003 compared with December 2002. Energy sales and purchased power costs are discussed below under "Results of Operations." Gas in storage increased at December 31, 2003 as compared with year end 2002 due primarily to higher unit costs and volumes of gas in storage at December 31, 2003 as compared with year end 2002. Prepaid pension costs for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York increased at December 31, 2003 as compared with year end 2002 due to the recognition of the current periods pension credits. Accounts payable for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York decreased at December 31, 2003 as compared with year end 2002 due primarily to a higher level of accrued construction commitments at year end 2002. This decrease was offset in part by increased electric purchased power costs for Con Edison of New York at December 31, 2003 as compared with year end 2002, reflecting higher unit costs. Superfund and other environmental liabilities for the Companies increased at December 31, 2003 as compared with year end 2002 reflecting increased estimates for investigation, removal and remediation costs. Deferred income taxes liability increased at December 31, 2003 as compared with year end 2002 due primarily to accelerating tax deductions for capitalized indirect costs. Transmission congestion contracts (See "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" in Note B to the financial statements) increased at December 31, 2003 compared with year end 2002 reflecting proceeds from the sale through the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) of transmission rights on Con Edison of New Yorks transmission system. These proceeds are being retained for customer benefit. Capital Resources Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily from dividends it receives from its subsidiaries and through the sale of securities, including commercial paper. In addition, Con Edisons ability to make payments on its external borrowings and dividends on its common shares is dependent on its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its interests in its subsidiaries. For information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see Note C to the financial statements. For information on the Companies commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see Note D to the financial statements. 48 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED The Utilities expect to finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally generated funds and external borrowings. In December 2001, the PSC authorized the Utilities to issue up to $1.95 billion of debt securities prior to 2006, of which Con Edison of New York issued $195 million and $525 million of debt securities in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, the PSC authorized the refunding of the Utilities outstanding debt securities and preferred stock. Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions from Con Edison, internally generated funds and external borrowings. See Note T to the financial statements. In August 2002, Congress appropriated funds for which Con Edison of New York is eligible to apply, to recover costs it incurred in connection with the World Trade Center attack. In accordance with procedural guidelines for disbursement of the federal funds, Con Edison of New York submitted its initial application for funds in October 2003 and received the first installment of $29 million on October 31, 2003. The Company will submit additional applications when appropriate. See Note R to the financial statements. For each of the Companies, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges (Securities and Exchange Commission basis) for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was: Earnings to Fixed Charges 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 Con Edison 2.7 3.1 3.3 3.0 3.8 Con Edison of New York 3.4 3.4 3.7 3.2 4.2 O&R 4.4 3.3 3.5 3.4 2.5 For each of the Companies, the common equity ratio at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was: As of December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Con Edison 48.0 48.1 49.8 Con Edison of New York 49.3 46.6 47.2 O&R 55.1 53.6 50.0 The commercial paper of the Companies is rated P 1, A 1 and F1, respectively, by Moodys Investor Service, Inc.

(Millions of Dollars) 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Regulated utility construction expenditures Con Edison of New York $ 984 $ 1,082 $ 1,167 $ 1,060 $ 1,362 O&R 59 58 71 83 81 Total regulated construction expenditures $ 1,043 $ 1,140 $ 1,238 $ 1,143 $ 1,443 Unregulated subsidiaries construction expenditures 154 282 105 30 29 Sub total 1,197 1,422 1,343 1,173 1,472 Retirement of long term securities at maturity Con Edison of New York 628 337 805 150 450 O&R 35 Unregulated subsidiaries 10 11 16 16 17 Total retirement of long term securities at maturity 638 348 856 166 467 Total $ 1,835 $ 1,770 $ 2,200 $ 1,339 $ 1,939 Con Edison of New Yorks utility construction expenditures in 2003 and 2004 reflect programs to meet electric load growth and reliability needs, gas infrastructure expenditures, the East River Repowering Project and expenditures for permanent electric, gas and steam system restoration following the World Trade Center attack (see Note R to the financial statements). The increase for 2005 reflects an anticipated higher level of expenditures for electric substations and ongoing improvements and reinforcements of the electric distribution system. The unregulated subsidiaries construction expenditures declined in 2003 and are expected to continue to decline, consistent with there being no major construction or acquisition expected for those businesses. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Con Edisons investment balance in these subsidiaries, on an unconsolidated basis, was $703 million and $790 million, respectively. Contractual Obligations The following tables summarize the Companies material obligations at December 31, 2003, to make payments pursuant to contracts. Long term debt, capital lease obligations and other long term liabilities are included on their balance sheets. Operating leases and non utility generator (NUG) contracts (for 50 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED which undiscounted future annual payments are shown) are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

Amounts shown for purchase obligations were derived from the Utilities purchasing systems as the difference between the amounts authorized and the amounts paid (or vouchered to be paid) for each obligation. For most of its other purchase obligations, the Utilities are committed to purchase less than the amount authorized, typically a 10 percent commitment. These other purchase obligations reflect capital and operations and maintenance costs entered into by the Utilities in running their day to day operations. Payments of the other purchase obligations are assumed to be made ratably over the terms of the obligations. (b)Represents commitments to purchase electric energy and capacity, natural gas and natural gas pipeline capacity and operation and maintenance generation service agreements entered into by Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries. 51  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED The Companies commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments are their other liabilities reflected in their balance sheets and Con Edisons guarantees of certain obligations of its subsidiaries. See Notes S and T to the financial statements. Electric Power Requirements In 2003, the Utilities purchased substantially all of the energy they sold to customers pursuant to firm contracts with NUGs and others and through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market. Con Edison expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2004. In general, the Utilities recover prudently incurred purchase power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See "Financial and Commodity Market Risks Commodity Price Risk" below and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. From time to time certain parties have petitioned the PSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity. To reduce the volatility of electric energy costs, the Utilities have firm contracts to purchase electric energy (including the output of the nuclear generating unit divested in 2001) and have entered into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of expected purchases, which together cover a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to customers in the summer of 2004. See Notes I and P to the financial statements. O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary entered into firm contracts to purchase electric energy for a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to its customers in 2004. Con Edison of New York also owns approximately 630 MW of generating stations associated primarily with its steam system, located in New York City, the electricity output of which it sells through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market. The East River Repowering Project will add incremental electric capacity of approximately 200 MW based on a winter nominal rating or approximately 125 MW based on a summer nominal rating. In a July 1998 order, the PSC indicated that it "agree(s) generally that Con Edison of New York need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops," but considers "overly broad" and did not adopt Con Edison of New Yorks request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, it will no longer be required to engage in long range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of capacity. Con Edison of New York monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO. Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries sell electricity in the wholesale and retail NYISO and other markets. At December 31, 2003, Con Edison Developments interests in electric generating facilities amounted to 1,668 MW. Con Edison Energy sells the electricity from these generating facilities under 52 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED contract or on the wholesale electricity markets. See "Financial and Commodity Market Risks Commodity Price Risk," below.  REGULATORY MATTERS For additional information about the electric, gas and steam agreements discussed below, see "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note B to the financial statements. Electric In July 2002, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) to establish a Standard Market Design (SMD) for wholesale electricity markets across the country. The proposed SMD has many of the elements of the markets that have been established in the Northeast, and if adopted, could facilitate transactions among energy markets across the country. After receiving over 1,000 comments on the proposals contained in its SMD NOPR, the FERC issued its Wholesale Market Platform "White Paper" on April 28, 2003. The White Paper built on the existing rules contained in Order 2000. Key among the attributes discussed in the White Paper are flexibility on the scope and configuration to allow for both Independent System Operators (ISOs) and Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs); the need for a regional planning process; the need for rate mechanisms that minimize cost shifts; the need to eliminate "seams" charges between ISOs and RTOs; the use of a real time market for energy to resolve imbalances; and the need for an approach to manage congestion, which could include locational pricing with firm transmission rights, that protects against manipulation, utilizes the grid effectively and promotes the use of lower cost generation. In addition, each region within an RTO or ISO will determine how it will ensure that its region has sufficient resources to meet customers needs. Since releasing its White Paper, the FERC has held technical conferences on various issues. However, it has not issued any specific orders for compliance. The energy bill introduced in Congress in 2003 contained a provision remanding SMD to the FERC and requiring that no new rule could be issued before October 31, 2006 or could become effective before December 31, 2006. The energy bill was not passed in 2003. The Senate leadership has stated its intent to bring the bill up for vote again in 2004. In September 1997, the PSC approved a restructuring agreement among Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties (the 1997 Restructuring Agreement). Pursuant to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, Con Edison of New York reduced electric rates on an annual basis by $129 million in 1998, $80 million in 1999, $103 million in 2000 and $209 million in 2001, divested most of its electric generating capacity, and enabled all of its electric customers to be served by competitive energy suppliers. In November 2000, the PSC approved an October 2000 agreement (the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement) that, among other things, revised and extended the electric rate plan provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement and addressed certain generation divestiture related issues. 53 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED The electric rate plan provisions of the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement cover the five year period ending March 2005. Pursuant to the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, Con Edison of New York reduced the distribution component of its electric rates by $170 million on an annual basis, effective October 2000. The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement continues the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers prudently incurred purchased power and fuel costs from customers. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. O&R has entered into settlement agreements or similar arrangements with the PSC, NJBPU and PPUC that provide for a transition to a competitive electric market. In October 2003, the PSC approved agreements among O&R, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates O&R can charge to its New York customers for electric service. The electric agreement, which covers the period from July 1, 2003 through October 31, 2006, provides for no changes to electric base rates and contains provisions for the amortization and offset of regulatory assets and liabilities, the net effect of which will reduce electric operating income by a total of $11 million (pre tax) between July 2003 and June 2006. During the second half of 2003, O&R amortized $3.7 million of the $11 million. The agreement continues to provide for recovery of energy costs from customers on a current basis and for O&R to share equally with customers earnings in excess of a 12.75 percent return on common equity during the three year period from July 2003 through June 2006. The period from July 2006 through October 2006 will not be subject to earnings sharing. In July 2003, the NJBPU ruled on the petitions of Rockland Electric Company (RECO), the New Jersey utility subsidiary of O&R, for an increase in electric rates and recovery of deferred purchased power costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" and "Rate and Restructuring Agreements Electric" in Notes A and B, respectively, to the financial statements. The NJBPU ordered a $7 million decrease in RECOs electric base rates, effective August 2003, authorized RECOs recovery of approximately $83 million of previously deferred purchased power costs and associated interest and disallowed recovery of approximately $19 million of such costs and associated interest. At December 31, 2002, the company had accrued a reserve for $13 million of the disallowance, and at June 30, 2003 reserved an additional $6 million for the disallowance. Gas In November 2003, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC to increase charges for gas service by $108 million (9.8 percent), effective October 2004. Con Edison of New York is currently operating under a gas rate agreement approved by the PSC in April 2002. The Agreement covers the three year period ending September 30, 2004. The rate agreement reduced retail sales and transportation rates by $25 million, on an annual basis. 54 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED In November 2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties that revised and extended the 1996 gas rate settlement agreement through September 2001. The 1996 agreement, with limited exceptions, continued base rates at September 1996 levels through September 2000. In October 2003, the PSC approved an agreement among O&R, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates O&R can charge to its New York customers for gas service. The O&R gas agreement, which covers the period from November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2006, provides for annual increases in gas base rates of $9 million (5.8 percent) effective November 2003, $9 million (4.8 percent) effective November 2004 and $5 million (2.5 percent) effective November 2005. The O&R gas agreement also continues a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. The agreement continues to provide for recovery of energy costs from customers on a current basis and for O&R to share equally with customers earnings in excess of an 11 percent return on common equity over the term of the agreement. The agreement also contains incentives under which, among other things, the company earns additional amounts based on attaining specified targets for customer migration to its retail access programs and the achievement of certain net revenue targets for interruptible sales and transportation customers. In November 2000, the PSC also approved a gas rate agreement between O&R, PSC Staff and certain other parties covering the three year period November 2000 through October 2003. Steam In November 2003, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC to increase annual charges for steam service by $129 million (14.6 percent), effective October 2004. Con Edison of New York is currently operating under a steam rate agreement that was approved by the PSC in December 2000. The agreement provided for a $16.6 million steam rate increase, which took effect October 2000 and, with limited exceptions, provided for no further changes in steam rates prior to October 2004.  FINANCIAL AND COMMODITY MARKET RISKS The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk. Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2003, each 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to the Companies 55 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED variable rate debt of $816 million would result in a change in annual interest expense of $1 million. For each 10 percent change in Con Edison of New Yorks and O&Rs variable interest rates applicable to their variable rate debt of $714 million and $59 million, respectively, annual interest expense for Con Edison of New York would change by $1 million and there would be no material impact for O&R. In addition, Con Edison and its subsidiaries, from time to time, enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See "Interest Rate Hedging" in Note P to the financial statements. Commodity Price Risk Con Edisons commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note P to the financial statements. Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2003, each 10 percent change in market prices would result in a change in fair value of $12 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $8 million is for Con Edison of New York and $4 million for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries use a value at risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of instruments or the portfolio due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. The unregulated subsidiaries estimate VaR across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for transactions associated with hedges on generating assets and commodity contracts, assuming a one day holding period, for the years ended December 31, 2003, and 2002, respectively, was as follows: 95% Confidence Level, One Day Holding Period 2003 2002 (Millions of Dollars) Average for the period $ 1 $ 1 High $ 3 $ 3 Low $ $ 1 56 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Credit Risk The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to over the counter transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the unregulated energy subsidiaries. Credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterpartys nonperformance. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, master netting agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements. The Companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff. Con Edisons unregulated energy subsidiaries had $71 million of credit exposure, net of collateral and reserves, at December 31, 2003, of which $63 million was with investment grade counterparties and $8 million was with the New York Mercantile Exchange or independent system operators. Investment Risk The Companies investment risk relates to the investment of the assets of their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," above. The Companies current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 65 percent equities and 35 percent fixed income and other securities. At December 31, 2003, the pension plan investments consisted of 64 percent equity and 36 percent fixed income and other securities. See Note E to the financial statements.  ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES Unregulated subsidiaries of Con Edison engage in energy trading activities that are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. See Note P to the financial statements. Prior to October 2002, these contracts were accounted for under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." As of October 2002, energy and energy related trading contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for under SFAS No. 133. Such contracts are marked to market with gains and losses recognized in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, Con Edison recognized in income net unrealized pre tax losses of $3 million and $1 million, respectively, excluding the effect of a cumulative adjustment due to a change in accounting principle. Contracts that did not fall within the scope of SFAS No. 133 were included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle recognized in December 2002. See Note P to the financial statements. 57 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED The changes in fair value of energy trading net assets for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: Twelve months ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 Fair value of net assets outstanding beginning of period $ 5 $ 11 Change in fair value during the period: Unrealized gain at inception 11 Net premium paid/(received) 2 (2 ) Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (3 ) Changes in fair value prior to settlement 25 6 Fair value realized at settlement of contracts (28 ) (18 ) Total change in fair value during the period (1 ) (6 ) Fair value of net assets outstanding end of period $ 4 $ 5 As of December 31, 2003, the sources of fair value of the energy trading net assets were as follows: (Millions of Dollars) Fair Value of Net Assets at Period End Source of Fair Value Maturity less than 1 year Maturity 1 3 years Maturity 4 5 years Maturity in excess of 5 years Total fair value Prices provided by external sources $ 7 $ $ $ $ 7 Prices based on models and other valuation methods (3 ) (3 ) Total $ 4 $ $ $ $ 4 "Prices provided by external sources" represent the fair value of exchange traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources. "Prices based on models and other valuation methods" represent the fair value of positions calculated using internal models when directly and indirectly quoted external prices or prices derived from external sources are not available. Internal models incorporate the use of options pricing and estimates of the present value of cash flows based on underlying contractual terms. The models reflect managements estimates, taking into account observable market prices, estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices, the risk free market discount rate, volatility factors, estimated correlations of energy commodity prices and contractual volumes. Counterparty specific credit quality, market price uncertainty and other risks are also factored into the models.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS For information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos, see Note G to the financial statements. 58 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED  IMPACT OF INFLATION The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the asset upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies long term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. Also, to the extent the Companies prices change by more or less than inflation, the real price of the Companies services will increase or decline. Over the past 20 years, for example, the real price of electric service has declined substantially.  MATERIAL CONTINGENCIES For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies material contingencies, see "Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies," above. 59  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 The Companies results of operations (which were discussed above under "Results of Operations Summary") in 2003 compared with 2002 were: Con Edison* Con Edison of New York O&R (Millions of Dollars) Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Operating revenues $ 1,325 15.6 % $ 942 13.0 % $ 92 14.5 % Purchased power 725 22.6 502 19.1 31 14.1 Fuel 215 74.4 126 54.3 Gas purchased for resale 251 42.1 243 51.5 31 34.8 Operating revenues less purchased power, fuel and gas purchased for resale (net revenues) 134 3.0 71 1.8 30 9.2 Other operations and maintenance 138 10.2 45 4.0 27 18.9 Impairment charges 159 N/A Depreciation and amortization 34 6.9 20 4.6 Taxes, other than income tax 2 0.2 (2 ) (3.8 ) Income tax (73 ) (18.3 ) 18 5.1 9 36.0 Operating income (126 ) (11.9 ) (12 ) (1.3 ) (4 ) (5.6 ) Other income less deductions and related federal income tax (26 ) (41.9 ) (19 ) (34.5 ) (3 ) Large Net interest charges (8 ) (1.8 ) (16 ) (4.1 ) (7 ) 25.0 Preferred stock dividend requirements (1 ) (8.3 ) (1 ) (8.3 ) Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 25 Large Net income for common stock $ (118 ) (18.3 )% $ (14 ) (2.3 )% $ % *Represents the consolidated financial results of Con Edison and its subsidiaries. A discussion of the results of operations by principal business segment follows. For additional business segment financial information, see Note O to the financial statements. The results reflect the application of the Companies accounting policies and rate plans that cover the rates the Utilities can charge their customers. In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full service customers. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A and "Regulatory Matters" in Note B to the financial statements.  CON EDISON OF NEW YORK Electric Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating revenues increased $559 million in 2003 compared with 2002, due primarily to higher fuel and purchased power costs of $503 million (which are recoverable 60 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED from customers), and a lower amount reserved for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return to be retained for customer benefit ($31 million). Changes to operating revenues also reflect variations in electric sales. Con Edison of New Yorks electric sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2003 compared with 2002 were:  MILLIONS OF KWHS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Variation Percent Variation Residential/Religious 12,441 12,481 (40 ) (0.3 )% Commercial/Industrial 18,033 19,111 (1,078 ) (5.6 ) Other 154 181 (27 ) (14.9 ) Total Full Service Customers 30,628 31,773 (1,145 ) (3.6 ) Retail access customers 12,637 11,926 711 6.0 Sub total 43,265 43,699 (434 ) (1.0 ) NYPA, Municipal Agency and Other Sales 10,470 10,267 203 2.0 Total Service Area 53,735 53,966 (231 ) (0.4 )% Electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area decreased 0.4 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease in delivery volumes reflects the cool weather in the second quarter of 2003 and the lower than normal number of hot days during the summer of 2003 compared with an exceptionally warm summer in 2002, partially offset by the cold winter weather in 2003 compared with the mild winter in 2002. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area increased 0.6 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. Weather adjusted sales represent an estimate of the sales that would have been made if historical average weather conditions had prevailed. Con Edison of New Yorks electric purchased power costs increased $477 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, due to an increase in the average unit price of purchased power. This increase was offset in part by lower usage by the companys full service customers and higher volumes of electricity purchased from other suppliers by participants in the companys retail access programs. Electric fuel costs increased $26 million, reflecting an increase in the average unit price of fuel. Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating income decreased $1 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The principal component of the decrease was an increase in other operations and maintenance expense ($41 million due primarily to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement benefits), property taxes ($17 million) and depreciation ($16 million). The increase in expenses was offset in part 61 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED by higher net revenues (operating revenues less purchased power and fuel costs $56 million), lower state and local revenue taxes ($7 million), sales and use tax ($5 million) and payroll taxes ($3 million). Gas Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating revenues in 2003 increased $250 million compared with 2002, due primarily to the higher cost of purchased gas of $244 million (which is recoverable from customers), and higher sales volumes. Con Edison of New Yorks revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. Con Edison of New Yorks gas sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2003 compared with 2002 were:  THOUSANDS OF DTHS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Variation Percent Variation Firm Sales Residential 51,944 44,163 7,781 17.6 % General 36,840 32,682 4,158 12.7 Firm Transportation 16,486 15,695 791 5.0 Total Firm Sales and Transportation 105,270 92,540 12,730 13.8 Off Peak/Interruptible Sales 15,247 12,622 2,625 20.8 Non Firm Transportation of Gas NYPA 23,360 25,467 (2,107 ) (8.3 ) Generation Plants 43,808 77,516 (33,708 ) (43.5 ) Total NYPA and Generation Plants 67,168 102,983 (35,815 ) (34.8 ) Other 17,766 22,301 (4,535 ) (20.3 ) Total Sales and Transportation 205,451 230,446 (24,995 ) (10.8 )% Con Edison of New Yorks sales and transportation volumes for firm customers increased 13.8 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase reflects the impact of the cold weather in the 2003 winter period compared with the mild weather in the 2002 winter period and increased new business. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the companys service area increased 3.6 percent in 2003. Non firm transportation of customer owned gas to NYPA and electric generating plants decreased 34.8 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to higher gas prices. In 2003, because of the relative prices of gas and fuel oil, electric generating plants in the companys gas service area utilized oil rather 62 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED than gas for a significant portion of their generation. The decline in gas usage had minimal impact on earnings due to the application of a fixed demand charge for local transportation. Con Edison of New Yorks purchased gas cost increased $244 million in 2003 compared with 2002, due to higher unit costs and increased sales volumes for firm sales customers. Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating income decreased $10 million in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting primarily an increase in other operations and maintenance expense ($4 million due primarily to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement benefits), depreciation ($4 million), state and local taxes on revenues ($5 million) and income tax ($4 million). The increases in expenses were offset in part by higher net revenues (operating revenues less gas purchased for resale $7 million). Steam Con Edison of New Yorks steam operating revenues increased $133 million and steam operating income decreased $1 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The higher revenues reflect higher sales volumes due to the cold winter weather in 2003 as compared with the mild weather in 2002. The increase also includes higher fuel and purchased power costs ($124 million) in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease in steam operating income reflects primarily higher income taxes ($10 million due to higher taxable income and a lower level of removal costs in 2003) and operations and maintenance expense ($3 million due to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement benefits) offset in part by an increase in net revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $9 million and lower state and local taxes on steam revenues ($4 million). Con Edison of New Yorks steam sales and deliveries in 2003 compared with 2002 were:  MILLIONS OF POUNDS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Variation Percent Variation General 729 600 129 21.5 % Apartment house 7,845 7,022 823 11.7 Annual power 17,674 16,897 777 4.6 Total Sales 26,248 24,519 1,729 7.1 % Steam sales volumes increased 7.1 percent in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting the impact of the cold weather in the 2003 winter period compared with the mild weather in the 2002 winter period.

The principal components of, and variations in, taxes, other than income taxes were: (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 651 $ 630 $ 21 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 321 327 (6 ) Payroll taxes 50 55 (5 ) Other taxes 18 28 (10 ) Total $ 1,040 (a) $ 1,040 (a) $ (a)Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customer in 2003 and 2002 were $1,393 and $1,352 million, respectively. Effective January 2003, New York City increased Con Edison of New Yorks annual property taxes by $94 million. Under the companys rate agreements, the company is deferring most of the property tax increase as a regulatory asset to be recovered from customers. Other Income Other income (deductions) decreased $19 million in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting $27 million of interest income on a federal income tax refund claim recorded in 2002, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense in 2003 as a result of the recognition in 2002 of income tax benefits relating to the September 2001 sale of the companys nuclear generating unit. Net Interest Charges Net interest charges decreased $16 million in 2003 compared with 2002 due primarily to the interest expense associated with a net federal income tax deficiency related to a prior period audit ($19 million) recorded in 2002. Income Taxes Operating income taxes increased $18 million in 2003 compared with 2002, primarily as a result of less flow through (non deferred) depreciation for tax purposes. In addition, lower operating income taxes in 2002 reflected a tax benefit from an Internal Revenue Service audit for tax years 1995 through 1997 and a write off of excess deferred tax reserves.  O&R Electric Electric operating revenues increased $54 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase is due primarily to higher purchased power costs in 2003 and accounting for the 2003 O&R electric rate agreement and the NJBPU ruling on the RECO rate petitions. 64 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED O&Rs electric sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2003 compared with 2002 were:  MILLIONS OF KWHS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Variation Percent Variation Residential/Religious 1,769 1,815 (46 ) (2.5 )% Commercial/Industrial 2,277 2,393 (116 ) (4.8 ) Other 111 111 Total Full Service Customers 4,157 4,319 (162 ) (3.8 ) Retail access customers 1,455 1,235 220 17.8 Total Service Area 5,612 5,554 58 1.0 Electric delivery volumes in O&Rs service area increased 1.0 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 due to the growth in the number of customers, higher average customer usage, and the positive effect of the cooler than normal weather in the first quarter of 2003, partially offset by negative impact of weather on the last nine months of 2003. After adjusting for weather variations and the August 2003 regional power outage, electric delivery volumes in O&Rs service area increased 2.5 percent in 2003. O&Rs purchased power cost increased $31 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to an increase in the average unit cost and the regulatory actions referenced above. This increase was offset by lower energy usage by the companys full service customers and higher volumes of electricity purchased from other suppliers by participants in O&Rs retail access program. O&Rs electric operating income decreased $6 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 due primarily to the referenced regulatory actions. Gas O&Rs gas operating revenues increased $38 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase is due primarily to higher cost of gas purchased for resale in 2003, higher firm sales and transportation volumes and the impact of the 2003 gas rate agreement. 65 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED O&Rs gas sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2003 compared with 2002 were:  THOUSANDS OF DTHS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Variation Percent Variation Firm Sales Residential 10,810 10,203 607 5.9 % General 3,314 3,295 19 0.6 Firm Transportation 8,498 6,368 2,130 33.4 Total Firm Sales and Transportation 22,622 19,866 2,756 13.9 Off Peak/Interruptible Sales 6,833 7,366 (533 ) (7.2 ) Non Firm Transportation of Gas Generation Plants 2,833 13,983 (11,150 ) (79.7 ) Other 1,134 1,057 77 7.3 Total Sales and Transportation 33,422 42,272 (8,850 ) (20.9 )% O&Rs sales and transportation volumes for firm customers increased 13.9 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase reflects the impact of the cold weather in the 2003 winter period compared with the mild weather in the 2002 winter period. Revenues from gas sales in New York are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. After adjusting for weather variations in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 3.0 percent higher in 2003 compared with 2002. Non firm transportation of customer owned gas to electric generating plants decreased 79.7 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to higher gas prices. In 2003, because of the relative prices of gas and fuel oil, power plants in the companys gas service area utilized oil rather than gas for a significant portion of their generation. In addition, one area power plant completed a construction project to directly connect to a gas transmission provider. The decline in gas usage had minimal impact on earnings due to the application of a fixed demand charge for local transportation. O&Rs cost of gas purchased for resale increased $31 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to increased sales to firm customers and increased gas unit costs in 2003. The increase is offset in part by increased volumes of gas purchased from other suppliers by participants in O&Rs retail access program. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. Gas operating income increased $2 million in 2003 as compared with 2002. The increase reflects an increase in net gas revenues (operating revenues less purchased gas) of $7 million, which is due primarily to increased sales and the referenced regulatory actions. The increase in net revenues was offset in part by increased gas operations and maintenance expenses of $2 million and increased federal and state income tax of $3 million. 66 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes decreased $2 million in 2003 compared with 2002.

(b)Includes a sales and use tax refund of approximately $800,000. Income Taxes Operating income taxes increased by $9 million in 2003 compared with 2002 due primarily to the result of less flow through (non deferred) depreciation for tax purposes. Other Income O&Rs other income (deductions) decreased $3 million in 2003 compared with 2002, due primarily to the reclassification to other income (deductions) of losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income related to investments in marketable securities. Net Interest Charges O&Rs net interest charges decreased by $7 million in 2003 compared with 2002, due primarily to the company recording interest charges of $5 million in 2002 as a result of a change by the NJBPU in the carrying charges allowed on the companys deferred purchased power balance in New Jersey and to lower interest on long term debt as a result of the redemption of a $35 million, 10 year debenture in March 2003 (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources," above). 67  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED  UNREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER Unregulated subsidiaries operating income for 2003 was $122 million lower than 2002. Operating revenues increased $292 million in 2003 compared with 2002 due primarily to higher sales from Con Edison Developments increased generating capacity and increased retail electric sales at Con Edison Solutions. Unregulated subsidiaries operating expenses, excluding income taxes, increased by $502 million, reflecting principally increased fuel and purchased power costs of $260 million, impairment charges of $159 million and increased operation and maintenance expenses of $83 million.

The increase in operation and maintenance expenses was attributable to increased costs at Con Edison Development ($51 million), primarily to operate the new generation assets, Con Edison Communications increased operating costs reflecting expansion of the business ($23 million), and higher depreciation for additional telecommunications facilities and generating assets placed in service ($13 million), offset in part by lower operation and maintenance costs at Con Edison Solutions ($6 million). Operating income taxes decreased $88 million for 2003 as compared with 2002 reflecting primarily lower taxable income (including the tax effect of the aforementioned impairment charges). Unregulated subsidiaries other income (deductions) increased $1 million and interest charges were lower by $1 million for 2003 as compared with 2002. Unregulated subsidiaries earnings reflect an increase of $25 million for 2003 as compared with 2002 resulting from the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles adopted in each year. For 2003, the positive cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $3 million (after tax) at Con Edison Development related to mark to market gains applicable to power sales contracts at certain generating plants, partially offset by the impact of the financial statement consolidation of its Newington plant. For 2002, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles included charges for goodwill impairment of certain generating assets at Con Edison Development, totaling $20 million (after tax), and a charge of $2 million (after tax) at Con Edison Energy relating to the accounting for certain contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities. Earnings attributable to Other, representing the parent company and inter company transactions, were $9 million lower for 2003 as compared with 2002 primarily reflecting higher interest expenses. 68 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 The Companies results of operations (which were discussed above under "Results of Operations Summary") in 2002 compared with 2001 were: Con Edison* Con Edison of New York O&R (Millions of Dollars) Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Operating revenues $ (887 ) (9.4 )% $ (898 ) (11.1 )% $ (101 ) (13.7 )% Purchased power (179 ) (5.3 ) (197 ) (7.0 ) (70 ) (24.1 ) Fuel (105 ) (26.6 ) (119 ) (33.9 ) Gas purchased for resale (264 ) (30.7 ) (194 ) (29.1 ) (40 ) (31.0 ) Operating revenues less purchased power, fuel and gas purchased for resale (net revenues) (339 ) (7.1 ) (388 ) (9.1 ) 9 2.8 Other operations and maintenance (148 ) (9.9 ) (160 ) (12.6 ) 2 1.4 Depreciation and amortization (31 ) (5.9 ) (27 ) (5.8 ) 1 3.0 Taxes, other than income tax (25 ) (2.2 ) (27 ) (2.5 ) (2 ) (3.7 ) Income tax (67 ) (14.4 ) (81 ) (18.6 ) (1 ) (3.8 ) Operating income (68 ) (6.0 ) (93 ) (8.9 ) 9 14.3 Other income less deductions and related federal income tax 63 Large 54 Large N/A Net interest charges 11 2.6 7 1.8 4 16.7 Preferred stock dividend requirements (2 ) (14.3 ) (2 ) (14.3 ) N/A Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 22 N/A N/A Net income for common stock $ (36 ) (5.3 )% $ (44 ) (6.8 )% $ 5 12.5 % *Represents the consolidated financial results of Con Edison and its subsidiaries.

See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A and "Regulatory Matters" in Note B to the financial statements.  CON EDISON OF NEW YORK Electric Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating revenues in 2002 decreased $575 million compared with 2001, reflecting primarily lower fuel and purchased power costs of $227 million (discussed below). The decrease also reflects the completion in March 2002 of amortizations of a previously deferred gain on the sale of divested plants and a previously deferred NYPA revenue increase ($43 million), a reserve established in 2002 for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return that are to be retained for customer 69 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED benefit in accordance with the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement ($40 million), a reserve established in 2002 related to the sale of the companys nuclear generating unit ($25 million), the amortization of the loss ($30 million) related to the sale of the companys nuclear generating unit and rate reductions and other amortizations in accordance with the companys rate agreements. The decrease in electric operating revenues was offset, in part, by an increase in electric sales revenues ($24 million) reflecting principally the hot summer weather. Con Edison of New Yorks electric sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2002 compared with 2001 were:  MILLIONS OF KWHS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2002 December 31, 2001 Variation Percent Variation Residential/Religious 12,481 12,049 432 3.6 % Commercial/Industrial 19,111 19,839 (728 ) (3.7 ) Other 181 166 15 9.0 Total Full Service Customers 31,773 32,054 (281 ) (0.9 ) Retail access customers 11,926 10,520 1,406 13.4 Sub total 43,699 42,574 1,125 2.6 NYPA, Municipal Agency and Other Sales 10,267 10,476 (209 ) (2.0 ) Total Service Area 53,966 53,050 916 1.7 % Electricity delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service territory increased 1.7 percent in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase reflects the impact of the hot summer weather, offset in part by the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002, and the soft economy. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, electricity delivery volumes in the service territory increased 0.5 percent in 2002. The companys electric purchased power costs decreased $175 million in 2002 compared with 2001, due to a decrease in the price of purchased power and an increase in volumes of electricity purchased from other suppliers by participants in the retail access programs. This decrease was offset in part by the companys increased purchased volumes resulting from the sale of the companys nuclear generating unit in September 2001 and the hot summer weather in 2002. Fuel costs decreased $52 million as a result of decreased generation at company owned power plants. In general, the company recovers prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC. The companys electric operating income decreased $93 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The principal component of the decrease was lower net electric revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $348 million. The decrease in net electric revenues reflects the sale of the nuclear generation unit and the same factors (other than lower fuel and purchased power costs) as 70 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED discussed above with respect to the decrease in electric operating income. The decrease in net electric revenues was offset in part by reduced other operations and maintenance expenses ($137 million) reflecting nuclear production expenses incurred in 2001 but not in 2002, and productivity improvements, lower depreciation and amortization expense ($32 million) and lower revenue taxes ($26 million). The decrease is also offset by lower operating income tax of $62 million. Gas Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating revenues decreased $223 million, resulting primarily from the lower cost of purchased gas ($194 million) in 2002 compared with 2001. The lower cost of purchased gas reflects primarily lower unit costs. The lower revenues also reflect reduced sales volumes, resulting primarily from the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002, and revenue reductions implemented in accordance with the gas rate agreement approved by the PSC in April 2002. Gas operating income decreased $8 million in 2002, reflecting a $29 million decrease in net revenues (operating revenues less gas purchased for resale), and increased property tax expense ($10 million), offset in part by reduced operations and maintenance expenses ($16 million), reduced revenue taxes ($10 million) and lower income taxes ($9 million). Con Edison of New Yorks gas sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2002 compared with 2001 were:  THOUSANDS OF DTHS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2002 December 31, 2001 Variation Percent Variation Firm Sales Residential 44,163 46,506 (2,343 ) (5.0 )% General 32,682 35,118 (2,436 ) (6.9 ) Firm Transportation 15,695 14,280 1,415 9.9 Total Firm Sales and Transportation 92,540 95,904 (3,364 ) (3.5 ) Off Peak/Interruptible Sales 12,622 14,731 (2,109 ) (14.3 ) Non Firm Transportation of Gas NYPA 25,467 13,762 11,705 85.1 Generation Plants 77,516 62,991 14,525 23.1 Total NYPA and Generation Plants 102,983 76,753 26,230 34.2 Other 22,301 15,718 6,583 41.9 Total Sales and Transportation 230,446 203,106 27,340 13.5 % Con Edison of New Yorks sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 3.5 percent in 2002 compared with 2001. Revenues from gas sales in New York are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. After 71 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the companys service territory decreased 1.5 percent in the 2002. The companys gas sales and transportation volumes vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the winter. A weather normalization provision that applies to the companys gas business moderates, but does not completely eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on gas operating income. Steam Con Edison of New Yorks steam operating revenues decreased $100 million. The lower revenues reflect reduced sales volumes and lower fuel and purchased power costs primarily as a result of the loss of the World Trade Center as a customer, the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy. The lower fuel and purchased power costs reflect primarily lower unit costs and volumes. Steam operating income increased $8 million for 2002 compared with 2001 due primarily to reduced operations and maintenance expenses of $9 million and lower income taxes of $11 million, offset in part by a decrease in net revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $11 million. Con Edison of New Yorks steam sales and deliveries in 2002 compared with 2001 were:  MILLIONS OF POUNDS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2002 December 31, 2001 Variation Percent Variation General 600 620 (20 ) (3.2 )% Apartment house 7,022 7,050 (28 ) (0.4 ) Annual power 16,897 17,657 (760 ) (4.3 ) Total Sales 24,519 25,327 (808 ) (3.2 )% Steam sales volume decreased 3.2 percent in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting primarily the loss of the World Trade Center as a customer, the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes The principal components of, and variations in, taxes, other than income taxes were: (Millions of Dollars) 2002 2001 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 630 $ 620 $ 10 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 327 365 (38 ) Payroll taxes 55 56 (1 ) Other taxes 28 26 2 Total $ 1,040 (a) $ 1,067 (a) $ (27 ) (a) Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customers in 2002 and 2001 were $1,352 million and $1,414 million, respectively. 72 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Other Income Investment income decreased $4 million in 2002 compared with 2001, due principally to reduced interest income earned on short term cash investments in 2002 compared with 2001. For 2001, the company had more cash on hand than in 2002, primarily as a result of the sale of its nuclear generating unit. Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $9 million in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily reflecting the East River Repowering Project. Other income increased $42 million in 2002 compared with 2001 due primarily to $27 million of interest income on a federal income tax refund claim, a $10 million write off in 2001 of an investment in the New York Discovery Fund, a $9 million increase in interest earned on regulatory assets (See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities SFAS No. 71," above), offset in part by reduced income of $3 million from non utility operations. Income tax expense decreased $4 million in 2002 compared with 2001 due primarily to the recognition of tax benefits relating to the September 2001 sale of the Companys nuclear generating unit. Net Interest Charges Net interest charges increased $7 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase reflects principally the interest expense associated with a net federal income tax deficiency related to a prior period audit ($19 million), partially offset by decreased interest expense on long term debt of $15 million. Income Tax Federal income tax decreased $29 million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting lower income before tax and deductions related to removal costs and tax credits. In 2000, New York State implemented a tax law change that reduced or repealed certain revenue based taxes and replaced them with a net income based tax. State income taxes decreased $57 million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting lower income before tax, lowering of the tax rate and prior period adjustments. The state income tax expense is offset against the savings from the eliminated or reduced revenue taxes. Any over or under collection of these taxes is deferred for return to, or recovery from, customers. See Notes A and M to the financial statements.  O&R Electric Electric operating revenues decreased $62 million in 2002 compared with 2001. This decrease was primarily the result of lower purchased power costs and tax recoveries in 2002. 73 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED O&Rs electric sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2002 compared with 2001 were:  MILLIONS OF KWHS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2002 December 31, 2001 Variation Percent Variation Residential/Religious 1,815 1,773 42 2.4 % Commercial/Industrial 2,393 2,567 (174 ) (6.8 ) Other 111 110 1 0.9 Total Full Service Customers 4,319 4,450 (131 ) (2.9 ) Retail access customers 1,235 799 436 54.6 Total Service Area 5,554 5,249 305 5.8 % Electricity delivery volumes in 2002 increased 5.8 percent compared with 2001 due to warmer than normal summer weather, customer growth and higher average usage. After adjusting for weather variations, total electricity delivery volumes were 3.2 percent higher in 2002. Net electric revenues (operating revenues less purchased power) were $8 million higher in 2002 than in 2001. Purchased power costs decreased $70 million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting decreases in the unit cost of purchased power and increased volumes of electricity purchased by customers from other suppliers. Electric operating income increased $8 million in 2002 as compared with 2001. This increase reflects the impact of higher net electric revenues along with lower New York state and local income and revenue taxes, offset in part by higher operation and maintenance charges and depreciation costs. Gas Gas operating revenues decreased $39 million in 2002 as compared with 2001. This decrease was primarily the result of lower gas costs and sales to firm customers in 2002.

Revenues from gas sales in New York are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. After adjusting for weather variations in each period, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 0.3 percent lower for 2002 compared with 2001. Net gas revenues (operating revenues less purchased gas) were $1 million higher in 2002 due primarily to incentives earned from interruptible and off system gas sales. The cost of gas purchased for resale was $40 million less in 2002 than in 2001, reflecting lower sales volumes and unit costs. Decreased gas revenues also reflect the reduced requirement for the company to buy gas for resale because of an increase in the purchase of gas by customers from other suppliers. Gas operating income increased by $1 million in 2002 compared with 2001, due primarily to higher net revenues and lower operations and maintenance expenses, offset in part by lower late payment charge revenues and higher depreciation. Other Operations and Maintenance Other operations and maintenance expense increased $2 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase was attributable primarily to higher electric transmission and distribution expenditures, partially offset by lower customer bad debt and collections expense. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes decreased by $2 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The decrease was primarily the result of lower New York State revenue taxes of $3 million, which resulted from reduced tax rates and lower energy costs billed to customers. Partially offsetting this decrease were higher property taxes of $1 million. The principal components of, and variations in, taxes, other than income taxes were: (Millions of Dollars) 2002 2001 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 27 $ 26 $ 1 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 21 24 (3 ) Payroll taxes 4 4 Other taxes Total $ 52 (a) $ 54 (a) $ (2 ) (a) Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes, billed to customers in 2002 and 2001 were $71 million and $66 million, respectively. 75 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Net Interest Charges Interest charges increased by $4 million in 2002 compared with 2001, primarily as a result of a change by the NJBPU in the carrying charges allowed on O&Rs deferred purchased power balance in New Jersey ($5 million) and lower allowance for borrowed funds used during construction ($1 million). These expenses were offset in part by lower net financing costs of $1 million that resulted from lower average debt balances and interest rates in 2002. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased by $1 million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting primarily lower state income taxes. State income taxes decreased primarily as a result of a 0.5 percent reduction in the New York State tax rate. Excluding certain taxes in New York that are reconciled to amounts included in rates, income taxes increased by $2 million due primarily to higher operating income in 2002.  UNREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER Earnings for the unregulated subsidiaries decreased $14 million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting a non cash, after tax charge in 2002 of $22 million for changes in accounting principles (see Notes L, P and T to the financial statements) and continued start up losses in the companys wholesale telecommunications business, including a non cash, after tax charge in 2002 of $5 million for a write down of an investment in Neon Communications, Inc. (NEON). The decrease in earnings was offset, in part, by higher electric retail sales volumes and gross margins, the capitalization of previously expensed project development costs on generation assets ($4 million after tax) and unrealized mark to market gains on derivative instruments ($7 million after tax). 76  ITEM 7A.
