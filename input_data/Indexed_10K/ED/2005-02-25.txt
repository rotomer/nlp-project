ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) This combined managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) relates to the consolidated financial statements of this report of the three separate registrants: Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison), Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York) and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R) and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto. Con Edison of New York and O&R (the Utilities) are subsidiaries of Con Edison and, as such, information in this MD&A about each of the Utilities also applies to Con Edison. As used in this report, the term the Companies refers to each of the three separate registrants: Con Edison, Con Edison of New York and O&R. However, neither of the Utilities makes any representation as to information in this report relating to Con Edison or the subsidiaries of Con Edison other than itself. Information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements referred to in this discussion and analysis is incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as see or refer to shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made. CORPORATE OVERVIEW Con Edisons principal business operations are those of the Utilities. Con Edison also has unregulated subsidiaries that compete in energy related businesses. Certain financial data of Con Edisons subsidiaries is presented below: Twelve months ended December 31, 2004 At December 31, 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues Net Income Assets Con Edison of New York $ 8,006 82 % $ 518 (b) 96 % $ 19,244 85% O&R 703 7 % 46 8 % 1,390 6% Total Utilities 8,709 89 % 564 104 % 20,634 91% Con Edison Development 417 4 % (4 ) (1 )% 1,270 6% Con Edison Energy 28 % % 119 1% Con Edison Solutions 626 7 % 3 1 % 119 1% Other(a) (22 ) % (14 ) (2 )% 366 1% Total continuing operations $ 9,758 100 % 549 102 % 22,508 100% Discontinued operations (c) % (12 ) (2 )% 52 % Total Con Edison $ 9,758 100 % $ 537 100 % $ 22,560 100% (a) Represents inter company and parent company accounting. (b) Reflects after tax charges discussed below. (c) Represents the discontinued operations of Con Edison Communications. Con Edisons net income for common stock in 2004 was $537 million or $2.28 a share. Net income for common stock in 2003 and 2002 was $528 million or $2.39 a share and $646 million or $3.03 a share, 33 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED respectively. The 2004 results reflect after tax charges totaling $80 million or $0.34 a share in accordance with Con Edison of New Yorks electric, gas and steam rate plans (see Note B to the financial statements) and $12 million or $.05 a share (after tax) losses from the discontinued operations of Con Edison Communications (see Note W to the financial statements). Included in 2003 net income for common stock were impairment charges for certain generating assets ($10 million after tax or $0.05 per share), the impact of a regulatory settlement ($5 million after tax charge or $0.03 per share) and losses from discontinued operations of Con Edison Communications ($109 million after tax charge or $0.50 per share, which includes an impairment charge of $84 million after tax or $0.38 per share), partially offset by the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles ($3 million after tax gain or $0.02 per share). Included in the 2002 results were the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles ($22 million after tax charges or $0.11 per share) and the loss from discontinued operations of Con Edison Communications ($21 million after tax charge or $0.10 per share). For segment financial information, see Note O to the financial statements and Results of Operations, below. See also Risk Factors, below. Regulated Utility Subsidiaries Con Edison of New York provides electric service to approximately 3.2 million customers and gas service to over 1 million customers in New York City and Westchester County. The company also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. O&R, along with its regulated utility subsidiaries, provides electric service to approximately 0.3 million customers in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of northern New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania and gas service to over 0.1 million customers in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of eastern Pennsylvania. The Utilities are primarily wires and pipes energy delivery companies that deliver energy in their service areas subject to extensive federal and state regulation. The Utilities customers buy this energy from the Utilities, or from other suppliers through the Utilities retail access programs. The Utilities purchase substantially all of the energy they sell to customers pursuant to firm contracts or through wholesale energy markets, and recover (generally on a current basis) the cost of the energy sold, pursuant to approved rate plans. Con Edison anticipates that the Utilities will provide substantially all of its earnings over the next few years. The Utilities earnings will depend on various factors including demand for utility service and the Utilities ability to charge rates for their services that reflect the costs of service, including a return on invested equity capital. 34 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED The factors affecting demand for utility service include weather and economic conditions. In December 2004 Con Edison of New York and O&R each experienced a new winter peak load for electricity. Con Edison of New York set monthly electric delivery records in 8 of the 12 months of 2004 and O&R for 10 of the 12 months of 2004. The peak electric loads for Con Edison of New York and O&R in 2004 were 11,327 MW and 1,330 MW, respectively. Because the energy delivery infrastructure must be adequate to meet demand in peak periods with a high level of reliability, the Utilities capital investment plans reflect in great part actual growth in electric peak load adjusted to summer design weather conditions, as well as forecast growth in peak loads. On this basis, Con Edison of New Yorks weather adjusted peak load in the summer of 2004 was 12,775 MW, 1.4 percent higher than the adjusted peak load in 2003. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2005 service area peak load will be 13,025 MW. The forecasted average annual growth rate of the electric peak load over the next five years is 1.5 percent. The company anticipates an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to meet this load growth with the high level of reliability that it currently provides (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Requirements, below). The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the rates they can charge their customers. Con Edison of New York has an electric rate plan (approved in November 2000) that ends March 31, 2005, and has pending with the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) a Joint Proposal supported by the company, PSC staff and other parties, which would establish a new rate plan for the period April 1, 2005 through March 31, 2008. The company has new gas and steam rate plans (approved in September 2004), effective October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2006, respectively. Among other things, the pending electric rate plan and the new gas and steam rate plans address the increased construction expenditures and related costs incurred and expected to be incurred to meet increasing customer demand and reliability needs. O&R has rate plans for its electric and gas services in New York that extend through October 31, 2006. Pursuant to the Utilities rate plans, charges to customers may not be changed during the respective terms of the rate plans other than for recovery of the costs incurred for energy supply and limited other exceptions. The rate plans generally require the Utilities to share with customers earnings in excess of specified rates of return on equity. Changes in delivery volumes are reflected in operating income (except to the extent that weather normalization provisions apply to the gas businesses). See Regulatory Matters below and Recoverable Energy Costs and Rate and Restructuring Agreements in Notes A and B, respectively, to the financial statements. Accounting rules and regulations for public utilities include Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, pursuant to which 35 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED the economic effects of rate regulation are reflected in financial statements. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies, below. In June 2004, the Utilities reached collective bargaining agreements covering essentially all of their employees that are union members (about two thirds of each of the companys employees). Unregulated Businesses Con Edisons unregulated energy subsidiaries participate in competitive businesses and are subject to different risks than the Utilities. In view of conditions affecting certain of its competitive activities, the company recognized an impairment charge of $18 million ($10 million after tax) for these businesses in the fourth quarter of 2003. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies, below and Note H to the financial statements. At December 31, 2004, Con Edisons investment in its unregulated energy subsidiaries was $599 million and the unregulated subsidiaries assets amounted to $1.5 billion. Consolidated Edison Solutions, Inc. (Con Edison Solutions) sells electricity to delivery customers of the Utilities and other utilities in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic regions and also offers energy related services. The company sold approximately 6.9 million megawatt hours of electricity to customers over the 12 month period ended December 31, 2004 and served approximately 28,000 electric customers at that date. Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. (Con Edison Development) owns and operates generating plants and participates in other infrastructure projects. At December 31, 2004, the company owned the equivalent of 1,668 MW of capacity in electric generating facilities of which 224 MW is sold under long term purchase power agreements and the balance is sold on the wholesale electricity markets. Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc. (Con Edison Energy) provides energy and capacity to Con Edison Solutions and others and markets the output of plants owned or operated by Con Edison Development. The company also provides risk management services to Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison Development and offers these services to others. Con Edison anticipates investing $14 million in its unregulated businesses over the next two years and will focus on increasing their customer base, gross margins and increasing the value of their existing assets. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Requirements and Capital Resources, below. Discontinued Operations In December 2004, after a comprehensive strategic review, Con Edison entered into an agreement to sell Consolidated Edison Communications, LLC (Con Edison Communications) to FiberNet Telecom Group, Inc. for $37 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Con Edison expects to complete the sale in 2005 following review or approval by the City of New York, the PSC and various federal, state and local regulators. At December 31, 2004, Con Edison Communications assets and liabilities 36 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED amounted to $52 million and $16 million, respectively. In addition, Con Edison Communications incurred net losses of $12 million, $109 million (including an after tax impairment charge of $84 million) and $21 million for the years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The contemplated sale will not result in a significant after tax gain or loss. See Note W to the financial statements. Results of Operations Summary Con Edisons earnings per share in 2004 were $2.28 ($2.27 on a diluted basis). Earnings per share in 2003 and 2002 were $2.39 ($2.38 on a diluted basis) and $3.03 ($3.02 on a diluted basis). Earnings per share for 2003 and 2002, before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $3 million and $(22) million after tax, respectively, were $2.37 ($2.36 on a diluted basis) and $3.14 ($3.13 on a diluted basis), respectively. Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Con Edison of New York $ 518 (c) $ 591 $ 605 O&R 46 45 45 Con Edison Development (4 ) (9 )(d) (4 )(f) Con Edison Energy 1 2 (g) Con Edison Solutions 3 19 22 Other(a) (14 ) (10 ) (3 ) Total continuing operations 549 637 667 Discontinued operations(b) (12 ) (109 )(e) (21 ) CON EDISON $ 537 $ 528 $ 646 (a) Represents inter company and parent company accounting including interest expense on debt and non operating income tax expense.

These risk factors include: Our Revenues And Results of Operations Reflect Regulatory Actions Our utility subsidiaries have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the prices they can charge their customers. The prices generally may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than for the recovery of energy costs and limited other exceptions. The rate plans include earnings adjustments for meeting or failing to meet certain standards. Certain of the plans require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. Regulators may also take actions affecting the company outside of the framework of the approved rate plans. See Application of Critical Accounting Polices and Regulatory Matters, below. Our Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Is Subject To Regulatory Restrictions Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or interest on our external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions we receive from our subsidiaries. The dividends that the utility subsidiaries may pay to us are generally limited to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See Dividends in Note C to the financial statements. We Purchase The Energy We Sell To Customers We purchase substantially all of the energy we sell to our customers. A disruption or delay in our energy supply arrangements could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers energy needs and our results of operations. We have policies to manage the economic risks related to energy supply, including related hedging transactions and the risk of a counterpartys non performance. Our utility subsidiaries generally recover their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including the cost of hedging transactions, in accordance with rate provisions approved by state utility regulators. Our unregulated energy subsidiaries enter into energy market transactions to manage their commodity related price and volumetric risks. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks Commodity Price Risk, below. We Have A Substantial Ongoing Utility Construction Program We estimate that our utility subsidiaries construction expenditures will exceed $1.5 billion in each of the next three years. The ongoing construction program includes large energy transmission and distribution system projects. The failure to complete these projects in a timely manner could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers growing energy needs with the high level of reliability that we currently provide. The Utilities expect to use internally generated funds and external financing to fund the construction expenditures. Changes 39 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED in capital market conditions or in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to raise money. Our commercial paper and unsecured debt are rated by Moodys Investors Services, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services and Fitch, Inc. These ratings impact our cost of funds. Our current ratings are shown in Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources, below. Our Unregulated Energy Subsidiaries Are In Evolving Businesses Our unregulated energy subsidiaries are active in evolving markets that are affected by the actions of governmental agencies, other organizations (such as independent system operators) and other competitive companies. Compared to the utility subsidiaries, the profitability of their products and services is not as predictable. Our Financial Statements Reflect the Application of Critical Accounting Policies The application of our critical accounting policies reflects complex judgments and estimates. These policies, which are described in Application of Critical Accounting Policies, below, include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other post retirement benefits, contingencies, long lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases. New generally accepted accounting policies or changes to current accounting policies or interpretations of such policies that affect our financial statements may be adopted by the relevant accounting authorities. We Are Engaged In A Material Legal Proceeding With Northeast Utilities In 2001, we sued Northeast Utilities to recover damages from their breach of our merger agreement with them and to seek the courts declaration that we had no further obligations under the merger agreement. Northeast Utilities alleges we breached the merger agreement and is pursuing a counter claim against us for damages in excess of $1.2 billion. There are also claims by purported classes of Northeast Utilities shareholders seeking damages from us that we believe to be substantially duplicative of those sought by Northeast Utilities. See Note Q to the financial statements. We Are Exposed To Material Liabilities Relating To Hazardous Substances Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or produced in the course of operations of our utility subsidiaries and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See Environmental Matters, below. We Are Subject To Extensive Government Regulation Our operations are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. We may be subject to new laws or regulations or the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations. We Are Exposed to Risks That Are Beyond Our Control Our results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather, which directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam and can affect the price of energy commodities. The cost of repairing damage to our operating subsidiaries facilities and 40 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED the potential disruption of their operations due to storms, natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts and other catastrophic events could be substantial. The occurrence or risk of occurrence of future terrorist attacks or related acts of war could also adversely affect the New York or United States economy. A lower level of economic activity for these or other reasons could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings and limit our future growth prospects. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This report includes forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward looking statements are statements of future expectation and not facts. Words such as expects, estimates, anticipates, intends, believes, plans, will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are based on information available at the time the statements are made, and accordingly speak only as of that time. Actual results or developments might differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements because of various factors such as those discussed under Risk Factors, above. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies critical accounting policies include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases. The critical accounting policies are as follows: Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities SFAS No. 71 The Utilities are subject to SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction. SFAS No. 71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under SFAS No. 71. 41 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in Note B to the financial statements. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission. In the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery (as required by SFAS No. 71), these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December 31, 2004, the regulatory assets for Con Edison, Con Edison of New York and O&R were $2.3 billion, $2.0 billion and $252 million, respectively. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries also provide such benefits to certain of their employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions. In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, future compensation, health care cost trends and appropriate discount rates. See Notes E and F to the financial statements for information about these assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2004, 2003 and 2002. Primarily because of the amortization of previous years net investment gains, Con Edison of New Yorks pension expense for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was negative, resulting in a credit to and increase in net income in each year. Investment gains and losses on plan assets are fully recognized in expense over a 15 year period (20 percent of the gains and losses for each year begin to amortize in each of the following five years and the amortization period for each 20 percent portion of the gains and losses is ten years). This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the New York Public Service Commission (PSC) and is permitted under SFAS No. 87. The cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets and assumptions for future periods. Con Edisons current estimate for 2005 is an increase, compared with 2004, in the pension and other postretirement benefits cost of $146 million and $9 million for Con Edison of New York and O&R, respectively. This increase reflects the amortization of prior period actuarial losses associated with declines in the market value of assets in recent years and a change in the discount rate assumption from 6.3% in 2004 to 5.9% in 2005. 42 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Amortization of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to reduce Con Edison of New Yorks and O&Rs pension and other postretirement benefit costs by an additional $34 million and $1 million in 2006, respectively. A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2005 as compared with the expected annual asset return of 8.8 percent would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for Con Edison of New York and O&R by approximately $14 million and $1 million, respectively, in 2006. In accordance with SFAS No. 71 and consistent with the gas and steam rate plans approved by the PSC in September 2004, effective October 1, 2004, Con Edison of New York is deferring as a regulatory asset or liability, as the case may be, any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106 allocable to gas and steam operations and the amounts reflected in gas and steam rates for such expenses. The companys pending electric rate plan includes a similar provision to reconcile pension and other postretirement benefit expense allocable to electric operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 71 and consistent with rate provisions approved by the PSC, O&R defers as a regulatory asset any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No. 87, SFAS No. 106 and the amounts reflected in rates for such expenses. Pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which Con Edison of New York, O&R and the unregulated subsidiaries make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets. An actuarial valuation of the plans funded status as of December 31, 2004, showed that the fair value of the plans assets exceeded the plans accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) by $672 million at that date. However, the fair market value of the plan assets could fall below the plans ABO in future years. In that event, each of the Utilities would be required, under SFAS No. 87, to accrue a liability equal in amount to the difference between its share of the fair value of the plan assets and its portion of the ABO, plus, in the case of Con Edison of New York, its total prepaid pension costs, through a non cash charge to other comprehensive income (OCI). The charge to OCI, which would be net of taxes, would not affect net income for common stock. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to their pension plans in 2004 under funding regulations and tax laws. O&R made a discretionary contribution of $22 million to the plan in 2004. In 2005, O&R and Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries expect to make discretionary contributions of $28 million and $1 million, respectively. The Companies policy is to fund their pension and postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible. Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, applies to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or 43 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include a PSC proceeding relating to the safety of the Con Edison of New Yorks utility systems (Note B); the Utilities responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G); a collection agents failure to forward to Con Edison of New York payments it had received (Note J); Con Edison Developments lease in/lease out transactions (Note K); legal proceedings relating to Con Edisons 1999 merger agreement with Northeast Utilities (Note Q); and legal proceedings relating to emergency response and restoration following the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center (Note R). In accordance with SFAS No. 5, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated. The Utilities recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for contingencies would not impact earnings. Accounting for Long Lived Assets SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under SFAS No. 144 an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value. Con Edisons unregulated businesses tested their assets for impairment in 2003. A critical element of this test is the forecast of future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the long lived assets. Forecast of these cash flows requires complex judgments about future operations, which are particularly difficult to make with respect to evolving industries such as the energy related and telecommunications businesses. Under SFAS No. 144, if alternative courses of action are under consideration or if a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows, the probability of those possible outcomes must be weighted. As a result of the tests performed in 2003, Con Edison recognized impairment charges of $159 million ($94 million after tax) for the assets of its unregulated telecommunications and generation businesses. See Notes H and W. In 2004, Con Edisons unregulated businesses again tested their assets for impairment, and no impairments were identified. With respect to the telecommunications assets, the agreement to sell 44 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Con Edison Communications (see Note W to the financial statements) for $37 million was used to establish fair value. With respect to the forecasted cash flows associated with Con Edison Developments generation facilities, a 10 percent decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for these facilities would not have resulted in an impairment charge. Accounting for Derivative Instruments The Companies apply SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, and other related accounting pronouncements to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below and Note P to the financial statements. Where the Companies are required to make mark to market estimates pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Estimated gains or losses are for the most part based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources. Estimated gains and losses based on models or other valuation methods comprise less than .01 percent of each of the Companies total revenues. Accounting for Goodwill Effective January 1, 2002, Con Edison adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This Statement modified the accounting and reporting of goodwill and intangible assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Con Edison no longer amortizes goodwill, but is required to annually test goodwill for impairment. See Note L to the financial statements. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill. In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, Con Edison recorded a loss of $34 million ($20 million after tax) as of January 1, 2002, relating to certain generation assets owned by an unregulated subsidiary. 45 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED The remaining unamortized goodwill of $406 million at December 31, 2004, was most recently tested for impairment during the first quarter of 2004. This test did not require any second step assessment and did not result in any impairment. The companys most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values. The Company estimated fair values primarily based upon discounted cash flows. A decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10 percent would not have resulted in the carrying value of any reporting units exceeding their estimated fair values. Accounting for Leases The Companies apply SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and other related pronouncements to their leasing transactions. See Note K to the financial statements for information about Con Edison Developments Lease In/Lease Out or LILO transactions, a proposed disallowance of tax losses by the Internal Revenue Service and a possible charge to earnings. In accordance with SFAS No. 13, Con Edison accounted for the two LILO transactions as leveraged leases. Accordingly, the companys investment in these leases, net of deferred taxes, is carried as a single amount in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet and income is recognized pursuant to a method that incorporates a level rate of return for those years when net investment in the lease is positive, based upon the after tax cash flows projected at the inception of the leveraged leases. In a recent meeting, the FASB tentatively decided that a change in the timing alone of the tax benefits that are realized by a lessor in a leveraged lease should result in a recalculation of the leveraged lease with any change in the recalculated net investment recognized as a gain or loss currently. Con Edison believes that its position on the LILOs is correct and is currently appealing the auditors proposal within the Internal Revenue Service. If Con Edison is unsuccessful in defending its position, the company may be required to recalculate the leveraged leases, which could result in a charge to earnings, the amount of which could have a material adverse effect on Con Edisons results of operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below. The principal factors affecting Con Edisons liquidity are its investments in the Utilities, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities. In addition, in the 2004 and 2003 periods, Con Edison issued 16.7 million and 11.9 million shares of common stock for $578 and $436 million, respectively, of which $512 million and $378 million were invested in Con Edison of New York. Con Edison also issued $200 million of five year debt in 2003 and $325 million of 40 year debt (most of which it invested in its unregulated subsidiaries) in 2002. 46 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED The principal factors affecting the Utilities liquidity are the cash flow generated from operations, construction expenditures and maturities of their debt securities. In addition, Con Edison of New York in 2004 and 2003 received net capital contributions from Con Edison of $512 million and $378 million respectively and in 2004, 2003 and 2002 issued $95 million, $45 million and $225 million, respectively, of additional debt net of redemptions. In 2003, O&R redeemed $35 million of debt at maturity with commercial paper. Con Edison of New Yorks expenditures have included approximately $447 million related to the attack on the World Trade Center and the subsequent restoration of lower Manhattan energy services and facilities; to date the company has received reimbursement of $76 million of such costs from insurance carriers and $63 million from the federal government and is pursuing further reimbursement of such costs. See Note R to the financial statements. The Companies current liabilities exceeded their current assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003. The Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short term borrowing to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short term borrowings using cash flow from long term financings and operating activities. The Utilities cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers. Each of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short term and long term cash requirements. See Risk Factors, and Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies, above, and Regulatory Matters, below. Changes in the Companies cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are summarized as follows: CON EDISON (Millions of Dollars) 2004 2003 Variance 2004 vs. 2003 2002 Variance 2003 vs. 2002 Operating activities $ 1,320 $ 1,321 $ (1 ) $ 1,581 $ (260 ) Investing activities (1,540 ) (1,546 ) 6 (1,634 ) 88 Financing activities 197 156 41 (100 ) 256 Net change for the period (23 ) (69 ) 46 (153 ) 84 Balance at beginning of period 49 118 (69 ) 271 (153 ) Balance at end of period (including restricted cash) $ 26 $ 49 $ (23 ) $ 118 $ (69 ) 47 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED CON EDISON OF NEW YORK (Millions of Dollars) 2004 2003 Variance 2004 vs. 2003 2002 Variance 2003 vs. 2002 Operating activities $ 1,201 $ 1,169 32 $ 1,310 $ (141 ) Investing activities (1,412 ) (1,337 ) (75 ) (1,273 ) (64 ) Financing activities 188 113 75 (214 ) 327 Net change for the period (23 ) (55 ) 32 (177 ) 122 Balance at beginning of period 33 88 (55 ) 265 (177 ) Balance at end of period (including restricted cash) $ 10 $ 33 $ (23 ) $ 88 $ (55 ) O&R (Millions of Dollars) 2004 2003 Variance 2004 vs. 2003 2002 Variance 2003 vs. 2002 Operating activities $ 81 $ 127 $ (46 ) $ 104 $ 23 Investing activities (81 ) (71 ) (10 ) (60 ) (11 ) Financing activities 3 (49 ) 52 (44 ) (5 ) Net change for the period 3 7 (4 ) 7 Balance at beginning of period 9 2 7 2 Balance at end of period (including restricted cash) $ 12 $ 9 $ 3 $ 2 $ 7 Cash Flows from Operating Activities The Utilities cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is dependent primarily on factors external to the Utilities, such as weather and economic conditions. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with rate plans approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction the PSC, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC). See Regulatory Matters below. In general, changes in the Utilities cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements. Net income for common stock is the result of cash and non cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies cash flows from operating activities. Principal non cash charges include depreciation and deferred taxes, Con Edisons impairment charges in 2003 and charges in 2004 under Con Edison of New Yorks new or pending electric, gas and steam rate plans. For Con Edison of New York, principal non cash credits included prepaid pension costs. Pension credits resulted from past favorable performance in Con Edison of New Yorks pension fund and assumptions about future performance. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits and Notes E and F to the financial statements. 48 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Net cash flows from operating activities in 2004 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $1 million lower and $32 million higher than 2003, respectively. The change at Con Edison of New York reflects lower accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2004 as compared with year end 2003 partially offset by an increase in materials and supplies. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2003 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $260 million and $141 million lower than 2002, respectively. This decrease reflects lower net income at Con Edison of New York (due to a certain extent to costs not reflected in current rates) and for Con Edison (due to greater losses at the unregulated subsidiaries). This decrease also reflects Con Edison of New Yorks increase in the value of gas in storage (reflecting both higher unit costs and higher volumes) and a higher level of accrued construction commitments at year end 2002 that were paid for in 2003. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in deferred income tax expense. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2004 for O&R were $46 million lower than in 2003 due primarily to lower deferred income tax expense partially offset by lower account receivable balances at December 31, 2004 as compared with year end 2003. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2003 for O&R were $23 million higher than in 2002 due primarily to increased deferred income tax expense, partially offset by the increased value of gas in storage (resulting from higher unit costs and volumes). Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison were $6 million lower in 2004 than in 2003, and $88 million lower in 2003 than in 2002, due primarily to lower construction expenditures by its unregulated subsidiaries, partially offset by increased construction expenditures by the Utilities. Cash flows used in investing activities were $75 million and $10 million higher in 2004 than in 2003, and $64 million and $11 million higher in 2003 than in 2002 for Con Edison of New York and O&R, respectively, due primarily to increased construction expenditures. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York increased $41 million and $75 million in 2004 compared with 2003, and increased $256 million and $327 million, respectively, in 2003 compared with 2002. O&R net cash flows from financing activities increased $52 million in 2004 compared with 2003, and decreased $5 million in 2003 compared with 2002. Con Edisons cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, reflect the issuance through public offerings of 14 million and 9.6 million Con Edison common shares resulting in proceeds of $512 million and $378 million, respectively, which were invested by Con Edison in Con Edison of New York. Cash flows from financing activities in 2003 also reflect the 49 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED issuance of $200 million of Con Edisons 3.625 percent 5 year debentures (most of which was invested in the unregulated subsidiaries). Cash flows from financing activities in 2002 reflect the issuance of $325 million of Con Edisons 7.25 percent 40 year debentures (the proceeds of which were used to repay commercial paper). Cash flows from financing activities for 2004, 2003 and 2002 also reflect the issuance of Con Edison common shares through its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans (2004: 2.7 million shares for $66 million, 2003: 2.3 million shares for $58 million; 2002: 1.7 million shares for $30 million). In addition, as a result of the stock plan issuances, cash used to pay common stock dividends was reduced by $39 million in 2004 and $40 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net cash flows from financing activities during the years ending December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 also reflect the following Con Edison of New York transactions: 2004 Issued $344 million of variable rate, tax exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, with various maturity dates between 28 and 35 years, the proceeds of which were used to redeem in advance of maturity fixed rate tax exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, 5.25% due 2020, 5.375% due 2022, 6.0% due 2028 and 7.125% due 2029; Issued $200 million 4.7% 10 year debentures and $200 million 5.7% 30 year debentures, the proceeds of which were used to redeem in advance of maturity $150 million 7.125% debentures due 2029 and for general corporate purposes; Redeemed at maturity $150 million 7.625% 12 year debentures; Issued $275 million 4.7% 5 year debentures, the proceeds of which were used in July to redeem in advance of maturity $275 million 7.35% 40 year debentures; 2003 Redeemed in advance of maturity $275 million 7.75% 35 year Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2031 using cash held for that purpose at December 31, 2002; Redeemed at maturity $150 million 6.375% 10 year debentures and issued $175 million 5.875% 30 year debentures; Redeemed $380 million 7.5% 30 year debentures due 2023 using the net proceeds from the issuance of $200 million 3.85% 10 year debentures and $200 million 5.10 percent 30 year debentures; 2002 Redeemed at maturity $150 million 6.625% 9 year debentures; 50 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Redeemed at maturity $150 million variable rate 5 year debentures and issued $300 million 5.625% 10 year debentures; Redeemed at maturity $37 million 6.125% Cumulative Preferred Stock, $100 par value; Issued $500 million 4.875% 10 year debentures. In 2002, Con Edison of New York changed the interest rate method applicable to $224.6 million aggregate principal amount of its tax exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2001A from a variable weekly rate mode to a 10 year term mode, callable at par after three years, with a 4.7 percent annual interest rate. In addition, Con Edison of New York entered into a swap agreement in connection with these bonds pursuant to which the company pays interest at a variable rate equal to the three month LIBOR and is paid interest at a fixed rate of 5.375 percent. See Note P to the financial statements. O&Rs cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 reflect the issuance of $46 million of 5.22% Transition Bonds associated with securitization of previously deferred purchased power costs of O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary, and the redemption at maturity of $35 million 6.56% 10 year debentures in 2003, partially offset by a reduction in commercial paper outstanding in 2004. Net cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 reflect the redemption at maturity of the debentures, partially offset by an increase in commercial paper. Cash flows from financing activities of the Companies also reflect commercial paper issuance (included on the consolidated balance sheets as Notes payable). The commercial paper amounts outstanding at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 and the average daily balance for 2004, 2003 and 2002 for Con Edison, Con Edison of New York and O&R were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of Dollars, except Weighted Average Yield) Outstandingat December31 Daily average Outstandingat December31 Daily average Outstandingat December31 Daily average Con Edison $ 156 $ 166 $ 156 $ 326 $ 151 $ 256 Con Edison of New York $ 100 $ 126 $ 99 $ 179 $ $ 157 O&R $ $ 9 $ 15 $ 33 $ 1 $ 1 Weighted average yield 2.2 % 1.2 % 1.0 % 1.2 % 1.2 % 1.7 % External borrowings are a source of liquidity that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital markets.

The changes in these balances are utilized to reconcile income to cash flow from operations. With respect to regulatory liabilities, see Note B to the financial statements. (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison2004 vs. 2003Variance Con Edison of New York2004 vs. 2003 Variance O&R2004 vs. 2003Variance Other current assets $ 145 $ 27 $ 10 Prepaid pension costs 185 185 Regulatory assets 401 370 31 Deferred income taxes liability 554 491 15 Regulatory liabilities transmission congestion contracts 107 107 Regulatory liabilities Electric, gas and steam rate deferrals 124 124 Other current assets for Con Edison increased at December 31, 2004 as compared with year end 2003 due primarily to federal and state income tax receivables recorded in 2004 and mark to market gains. Prepaid pension costs for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York increased at December 31, 2004 as compared with year end 2003 due to the recognition of the current periods pension credits. Regulatory assets increased for Con Edison, Con Edison of New York and O&R at December 31, 2004 as compared with year end 2003. The increases for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were due primarily to the deferral of future income tax, electric interference costs and costs incurred in the restoration of service and facilities following the World Trade Center attack. The O&R increase was due primarily to the deferral of Transition Bond Charges (see Rate and Restructuring Agreements in Note B to the financial statements), partially offset by a reduction in recoverable energy costs. Deferred income taxes and investment tax credits increased for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York due primarily to higher plant related deductions for tax purposes. Transmission congestion contract (TCC) deferred revenues increased at December 31, 2004 as compared with year end 2003 reflecting proceeds from the sale through the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) of transmission rights on Con Edison of New Yorks transmission system (see NYISO in Note A to the financial statements). These proceeds are being retained for customer benefit. Electric, gas and steam rate deferrals increased at December 31, 2004 as compared with year end 2003 reflecting the agreement with the PSC and other parties to resolve certain issues raised in the electric, gas and steam rate proceedings, related to the treatment of prior period pension credits (see Rate and Restructuring Agreements in Note B to the financial statements). 52 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Capital Resources Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily from dividends it receives from its subsidiaries and through the sale of securities, including commercial paper and the issuance of Con Edison common shares through its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans. Con Edisons ability to make payments on its external borrowings and dividends on its common shares is also dependent on its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its interests in its subsidiaries. For information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see Note C to the financial statements. For information on the Companies commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see Note D to the financial statements. The Utilities expect to finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally generated funds and external borrowings. In January 2005, Con Edison of New York filed a petition with the PSC for authorization to issue up to $4.4 billion of debt securities prior to December 31, 2009. The new authorization would supersede the companys December 2001 PSC financing authorization pursuant to which currently up to $830 million of debt securities could be issued prior to 2006. O&R is authorized by the PSC to issue up to $150 million of debt securities prior to 2006. In addition, the PSC has authorized the refunding of the Utilities outstanding debt securities and preferred stock, should the Utilities determine that it is economic to do so. Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions from Con Edison, internally generated funds and external borrowings. See Note T to the financial statements. In August 2002, Congress appropriated funds for which Con Edison of New York is eligible to apply to recover costs it incurred in connection with the World Trade Center attack. In accordance with procedural guidelines for disbursement of the federal funds, Con Edison of New York has received two installments totaling $63 million as of December 31, 2004. The Company has submitted an additional application for funds and will submit further applications when appropriate. See Note R to the financial statements. 53 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED For each of the Companies, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges (Securities and Exchange Commission basis) for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was: Earnings to Fixed Charges Ratio 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Con Edison 2.6 2.7 3.1 3.3 3.0 Con Edison of New York 3.1 3.4 3.4 3.7 3.2 O&R 4.0 4.4 3.3 3.5 3.4 For each of the Companies, the common equity ratio at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was: Common Equity Ratio 2004 2003 2002 Con Edison 51.0 48.0 48.1 Con Edison of New York 52.9 49.3 46.6 O&R 52.9 55.1 53.6 The commercial paper of the Companies is rated P 1, A 1 and F1, respectively, by Moodys Investors Service, Inc.

The increase for 2005 reflects an anticipated higher level of expenditures for electric substations and ongoing improvements and reinforcements of the electric distribution system. The unregulated energy subsidiaries construction expenditures declined in 2004 and are expected to continue to decline, consistent with there being no major construction or acquisition identified for those businesses at this time. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Con Edisons investment balance in these subsidiaries, on an unconsolidated basis, was $599 million and $703 million, respectively. The 2004 amount does not include Con Edison Communications. 55 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Contractual Obligations The following tables summarize the Companies material obligations at December 31, 2004, to make payments pursuant to contracts.

(b) Con Edison of New Yorks contractual obligations under its non utility generator contracts and other purchase power agreements include the cost of energy and capacity that the company is obligated to purchase under the contracts described in Notes I, N and T to the financial statements. (c) Included in these amounts is the cost of minimum quantities of natural gas supply, transportation and storage that the Utilities are obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. (d) Amounts shown for other purchase obligations, which reflect capital and operations and maintenance costs incurred by the Utilities in running their day to day operations, were derived from the Utilities purchasing systems as the difference between the amounts authorized and the amounts paid (or vouchered to be paid) for each obligation. For many of these obligations, the Utilities are committed to purchase less than the amount authorized. Payments of the other purchase obligations are generally assumed to be made ratably over the term of the obligations. The Utilities believe that unreasonable effort and expense would be involved to modify their purchasing systems to enable them to report their other purchase obligations in a different manner. (e) Amounts represent commitments to purchase minimum quantities of electric energy and capacity, natural gas, natural gas pipeline capacity and generating plant services entered into by Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries. Amounts do not include commitments of Con Edison Communications. The Companies commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments include their other liabilities reflected in their balance sheets, any funding obligations for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and Con Edisons guarantees of certain obligations of its subsidiaries. See Notes E, F, S and T to the financial statements. Electric Power Requirements In 2004, the Utilities purchased substantially all of the energy they sold to customers pursuant to firm contracts with NUGs and others and through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market. Con Edison expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2005. In general, the Utilities recover prudently incurred purchase power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks Commodity Price Risk, below and Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements. From time to time certain parties have petitioned the PSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity. To reduce the volatility of electric energy costs, the Utilities have firm contracts to purchase electric energy and enter into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of their expected purchases, which together cover a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to customers in the summer of 2005. See Notes I and P to the financial statements. O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary entered into firm contracts to purchase electric energy for substantially all of the electric energy expected to be sold to its customers in 2005. 57 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Con Edison of New York also owns generating stations in New York City associated primarily with its steam system, with electric capacity of approximately 565 MW. In addition, the companys East River Repowering Project, which is expected to be placed in service in 2005, will add incremental electric capacity of 200 MW based on a winter nominal rating (125 MW based on a summer nominal rating). The company sells the electric output of its generating stations through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market. In a July 1998 order, the PSC indicated that it agree(s) generally that Con Edison of New York need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops, but considers overly broad and did not adopt Con Edison of New Yorks request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, it will no longer be required to engage in long range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of capacity. Con Edison of New York monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO. Mirant Corporation is the owner of the Lovett generating station located in O&Rs service territory. Mirant, which is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings, has indicated in their recent Plan of Reorganization that under certain circumstances it would shut down the Lovett units in 2007 and 2008. If the units were shut down and in the absence of replacement generation added in the area, O&Rs transmission system could require modification in order to meet existing transmission reliability criteria. Con Edisons unregulated energy subsidiaries sell electricity in the wholesale and retail NYISO and other markets. At December 31, 2004, Con Edison Developments interests in electric generating facilities amounted to 1,668 MW. Con Edison Energy sells the electricity from these generating facilities under contract or on the wholesale electricity markets. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks Commodity Price Risk, below. REGULATORY MATTERS For additional information about the electric, gas and steam agreements discussed below, see Rate and Restructuring Agreements in Note B to the financial statements. Electric In September 1997, the PSC approved a restructuring agreement among Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties (the 1997 Restructuring Agreement). Pursuant to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, Con Edison of New York reduced electric rates, divested most of its electric generating capacity, and enabled all of its electric customers to be served by competitive energy 58 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED suppliers. O&R operates under regulatory frameworks authorized by the PSC, NJBPU and PPUC that provide for a transition to a competitive electric market. In November 2000, the PSC approved an electric rate agreement for Con Edison of New York covering the five year period ending March 2005, which, among other things, revised and extended the electric rate plan provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement and addressed certain generation divestiture related issues. In December 2004, Con Edison of New York entered into a Joint Proposal with the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to its electric rates. The new electric rate plan, which is subject to PSC approval, covers the three year period April 2005 through March 2008, and provides for expected increases in delivery service rates of $104.6 million, effective April 1, 2005, and $220.4 million effective April 1, 2007. The rate increase is net of $100 million (pre tax) the company agreed to apply for customer benefit relating primarily to the treatment of prior period pension credits. In addition, the company will retain the first $60 million of auction proceeds from the sale of transmission rights on the companys transmission system (transmission congestion contracts) in each of the three years. The rate increases are lower than they otherwise would have been as a result of the amortization of certain regulatory assets and liabilities, the net effect of which will be to increase electric revenues by $128 million, $173 million and $249 million in each of the 12 month periods ended March 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. In October 2003, the PSC approved an agreement among O&R, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates O&R can charge to its New York customers for electric service. The agreement, which covers the period from July 1, 2003 through October 31, 2006, provides for no changes to electric base rates and contains provisions for the amortization and offset of regulatory assets and liabilities, the net effect of which will reduce electric operating income by a total of $11 million (pre tax) between July 2003 and June 2006. In July 2003, the NJBPU ruled on the petitions of Rockland Electric Company (RECO), the New Jersey utility subsidiary of O&R, for an increase in electric rates and recovery of deferred purchased power costs. The NJBPU ordered a $7 million decrease in RECOs electric base rates, effective August 2003, authorized RECOs recovery of approximately $83 million of previously deferred purchased power costs and associated interest and disallowed recovery of approximately $19 million of such costs and associated interest. In July 2004, the NJBPU approved RECOs Phase II petition of O&Rs New Jersey utility subsidiary, RECO, to increase base rates annually by $2.7 million (2.0% increase), effective August 1, 2004. 59 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Gas In September 2004, the PSC approved a Joint Proposal by Con Edison of New York, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates the company can charge its customers for gas and steam services. The approved gas rate plan covers the three year period from October 2004 through September 2007, and provides for an increase in gas delivery rates of $46.8 million, effective October 1, 2004, with deferral accounting to be used to allocate the income statement effect of the increase over the term of the agreement. The rate increase is net of $17.5 million (pre tax) the company agreed to apply for customer benefit relating primarily to the treatment of prior period pension credits, for which the company recognized a charge upon approval of the plan in September 2004. In addition to this rate increase, the company will retain the first $35 million of net revenues from non firm customer transactions for each year of the rate plan and share with customers such revenues in excess of $35 million. In October 2003, the PSC approved an agreement among O&R, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates O&R can charge to its New York customers for gas delivery service. The agreement, which covers the period from November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2006, provides for annual increases in gas base rates of $9 million (5.8 percent) effective November 2003, $9 million (4.8 percent) effective November 2004 and $5 million (2.5 percent) effective November 2005. The agreement also contains incentives under which, among other things, the company earns additional amounts based on attaining specified targets for customer migration to its retail access programs and the achievement of certain net revenue targets for interruptible sales and transportation customers. Steam The Joint Proposal approved by the PSC in September 2004 for Con Edison of New York gas and steam rates includes a steam rate plan covering the two year period from October 2004 through September 2006. The plan provides for increases in steam base rates of $49.6 million, effective October 1, 2004, and $27.4 million, effective October 1, 2005. The increases are net of a total of $6.2 million (pre tax) the company agreed to apply for customer benefit relating primarily to the treatment of prior period pension credits, for which the company recognized a charge upon approval of the plan in September 2004. FINANCIAL AND COMMODITY MARKET RISKS The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk. Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt 60 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED securities. Con Edison and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2004, each 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to the Companies variable rate debt of $1 billion would result in a change in annual interest expense of $2 million. For each 10 percent change in Con Edison of New Yorks and O&Rs variable interest rates applicable to their variable rate debt of $1 billion and $44 million, respectively, annual interest expense for Con Edison of New York would change by $2 million and there would be no material impact for O&R. In addition, from time to time, Con Edison and its subsidiaries enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See Interest Rate Hedging in Note P to the financial statements. Commodity Price Risk Con Edisons commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and Con Edisons unregulated energy subsidiaries have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note P to the financial statements. Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2004, each 10 percent change in market prices would result in a change in fair value of $70 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $54 million is for Con Edison of New York and $16 million for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements. Con Edisons unregulated energy subsidiaries use a value at risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of instruments or the portfolio due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. These subsidiaries estimate VaR across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for transactions associated with hedges 61 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED on generating assets and commodity contracts, assuming a one day holding period, for the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, respectively, was as follows: 95% Confidence Level, One Day Holding Period 2004 2003 (Millions of Dollars) Average for the period $ 1 $ 1 High $ 3 $ 3 Low $ 1 $ Credit Risk The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to over the counter transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the unregulated energy subsidiaries. Credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterpartys nonperformance. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, master netting agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements. The Companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff. Con Edisons unregulated energy subsidiaries had $80 million of credit exposure, net of collateral and reserves, at December 31, 2004, of which $59 million was with investment grade counterparties and $21 million was with the New York Mercantile Exchange or independent system operators. Investment Risk The Companies investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, above. The Companies current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 65 percent equities and 35 percent fixed income and other securities. At December 31, 2004, the pension plan investments consisted of 67 percent equity and 33 percent fixed income and other securities. See Note E to the financial statements. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS For information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos, see Note G to the financial statements. IMPACT OF INFLATION The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant 62 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies long term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. Also, to the extent the Companies prices change by more or less than inflation, the real price of the Companies services will increase or decline. Over the past 20 years, for example, the real price of electric delivery service has declined substantially. MATERIAL CONTINGENCIES For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies material contingencies, see Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of operations reflect, among other things, the Companies accounting policies (see Application of Critical Accounting Policies, above), rate plans that cover the rates the Utilities can charge their customers (see Regulatory Matters, above) and demand for utility service. Demand for utility service is affected by weather, economic conditions and other factors. The Companies results of operations for the 12 months ended December 31, 2004 were negatively affected by the lower than normal number of hot days during the summer months, which offset the benefit of the unusually warm spring. For Con Edison and Con Edison of New York, the results also reflect charges totaling $124 million ($80 million after tax) related to the new and pending electric, gas and steam rate plans (see Note B to the financial statements), higher operations and maintenance expenses, and a reduction in net credits for pensions and other postretirement benefits. In addition, higher depreciation and property taxes in 2004 reflect large continuing investments in energy delivery infrastructure. For Con Edison, results of operations for 2003 and 2002 have been restated to reflect accounting for the discontinued operations of Con Edison Communications. For additional information about major factors affecting earnings, see Results of Operations Summary, above. In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full service customers (see Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A and Regulatory Matters in Note B to the financial statements). Accordingly, such costs do not generally affect the Companies results of operations. Management uses the term net revenues (operating revenues less such costs) to identify changes in operating revenues that may affect the Companies results of operations. Management believes that, although net revenues may not be a measure determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the measure facilitates the analysis by management and investors of the Companies results of operations. 63 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED A discussion of the results of operations by principal business segment for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 follows. For additional business segment financial information, see Note O to the financial statements.

CON EDISON OF NEW YORK Electric Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating revenues were $181 million lower in 2004 than in 2003, due primarily to the non cash charge ($100 million) under the pending electric rate plan (see Note B 64 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED to the financial statements) and decreased purchased power costs of $80 million. The decrease is partially offset by the increase in recoverable fuel costs ($46 million). Changes to operating revenues also reflect variations in electric sales. Con Edison of New Yorks electric sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2004 compared with 2003 were: MILLIONS OF KWHS Twelve Months Ended Variation Percent Variation Description December 31,2004 December 31,2003 Residential/Religious 12,673 12,441 232 1.9 % Commercial/Industrial 16,966 18,033 (1,067 ) (5.9 ) Other 229 154 75 48.7 TOTAL FULL SERVICE CUSTOMERS 29,868 30,628 (760 ) (2.5 ) Retail access customers 14,143 12,637 1,506 11.9 SUB TOTAL 44,011 43,265 746 1.7 NYPA, Municipal Agency and Other Sales 10,730 10,470 260 2.5 TOTAL SERVICE AREA 54,741 53,735 1,006 1.9 % Electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area increased 1.9 percent in 2004 compared with 2003, reflecting principally increased new business. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area increased 1.4 percent in 2004 compared with 2003. Weather adjusted sales represent an estimate of the sales that would have been made if historical average weather conditions had prevailed. Con Edison of New Yorks electric fuel costs increased $46 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because the companys generation plants were dispatched more frequently than in the same period last year. Electric purchased power costs decreased $80 million, reflecting a decrease in purchased volumes, partially offset by higher unit costs. Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating income decreased $106 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The principal components of the decrease were lower net revenues ($147 million), and increases in other operations and maintenance expense ($49 million due primarily to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement benefits), property taxes ($21 million) and depreciation ($16 million). The increase in expenses were offset in part by lower income tax ($80 million), state and local revenue taxes ($32 million), sales and use tax ($8 million). 65 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Gas Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating revenues in 2004 increased $8 million compared with 2003, reflecting primarily higher firm and non firm revenues due principally to the new gas rate plan ($23 million) and the reconciliation of gas distribution losses to levels reflected in rates, which resulted in a net benefit of $12 million. This increase was partially offset by non cash charge ($18 million) under the new gas rate plan (see Note B to the financial statements). Con Edison of New Yorks revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. Con Edison of New Yorks gas sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2004 compared with 2003 were: THOUSANDS OF DTHS Twelve Months Ended Percent Variation Description December 31,2004 December 31,2003 Variation FIRM SALES Residential 48,569 51,944 (3,375 ) (6.5 )% General 35,887 36,840 (953 ) (2.6 ) FIRM TRANSPORTATION 16,795 16,486 309 1.9 TOTAL FIRM SALES AND TRANSPORTATION 101,251 105,270 (4,019 ) (3.8 ) Off Peak/Interruptible Sales 13,187 15,247 (2,060 ) (13.5 ) NON FIRM TRANSPORTATION OF GAS NYPA 18,623 23,360 (4,737 ) (20.3 ) Generation Plants 44,772 43,808 964 2.2 TOTAL NYPA AND GENERATION PLANTS 63,395 67,168 (3,773 ) (5.6 ) Other 18,534 17,766 768 4.3 TOTAL SALES AND TRANSPORTATION 196,367 205,451 (9,084 ) (4.4 )% Con Edison of New Yorks sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 3.8 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting the impact of milder winter and warmer spring weather, partially offset by increased new business. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the companys service area increased 0.6 percent in 2004. Non firm transportation of customer owned gas to NYPA and electric generating plants decreased 5.6 percent in 2004 as compared with 2003 due to higher gas prices. In 2004, because of the relative prices of gas and fuel oil, electric generating plants in the companys gas service area utilized oil rather than gas for a significant portion of their generation. The decline in gas usage had minimal impact on earnings due to the application of a fixed demand charge for local transportation. 66 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Con Edison of New Yorks purchased gas cost decreased $6 million in 2004 compared with 2003, due to lower delivery volumes, partially offset by higher unit costs. Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating income increased $3 million in 2004 compared with 2003, reflecting primarily higher net revenues ($14 million) and lower sales and use tax ($1 million). This increase was partially offset by increases in other operations and maintenance expense ($8 million due primarily to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement benefits), depreciation ($3 million) and income tax ($3 million). Steam Con Edison of New Yorks steam operating revenues increased $13 million and steam operating income decreased $13 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase includes higher purchased power costs ($20 million) in 2004 reflecting an increase in purchased volumes and higher unit costs compared with 2003, partially offset by the non cash charge ($6 million) under the new steam rate plan (see Note B to the financial statements). The decrease in steam operating income reflects increased operations and maintenance expense ($19 million, principally related to the cost of insulating steam manhole covers) and lower net revenues of $7 million. This decrease was partially offset by lower income taxes ($15 million) due to lower income.

After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, steam sales decreased 0.4 percent in 2004. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes At $1 billion, taxes other than income taxes remain one of Con Edison of New Yorks largest operating expenses. 67 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED The principal components of, and variations in, taxes, other than income taxes were: (Millions of Dollars) 2004 2003 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 681 $ 651 $ 30 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 283 321 (38 ) Payroll taxes 53 50 3 Other taxes (4 ) 18 (22 ) Total $ 1,013 (a) $ 1,040 (a) $ (27 ) (a) Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customer in 2004 and 2003 were $1,357 and $1,393 million, respectively. Income Taxes Operating income taxes decreased $92 million in 2004 compared with 2003, due principally to lower income in the 2004 period. Other Income (Deductions) Other income (deductions) increased $17 million in 2004 compared with 2003, due primarily to increased allowance for equity funds used during construction and interest income associated with use tax and federal income tax. Net Interest Charges Net interest charges decreased $27 million in 2004 compared with 2003, due principally to lower interest expense on long term debt as a result of refinancing long term debt at lower interest rates, offset, in part, by additional debt issuances during the year. O&R Electric Electric operating revenues decreased $31 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The decrease is due primarily to accounting in 2003 for the New York rate agreement and the NJBPU ruling on the RECO rate petitions (see Rate and Restructuring Agreements in Note B to the financial statements), as well as the deferral in 2004 of state income tax benefits for ratepayers, and lower purchased power costs. 68 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED O&Rs electric sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2004 compared with 2003 were: MILLIONS OF KWHS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31,2004 December 31,2003 Variation Percent Variation Residential/Religious 1,729 1,769 (40 ) (2.3 )% Commercial/Industrial 2,046 2,277 (231 ) (10.1 ) Other 107 111 (4 ) (3.6 ) TOTAL FULL SERVICE CUSTOMERS 3,882 4,157 (275 ) (6.6 ) Retail access customers 1,861 1,455 406 27.9 TOTAL SERVICE AREA 5,743 5,612 131 2.3 % Electric delivery volumes in O&Rs service area increased 2.3 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 due to the growth in the number of customers and higher average customer usage. After adjusting for weather variations in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, electric delivery volumes in O&Rs service area increased 2.3 percent in 2004. O&Rs purchased power cost decreased $4 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 due to a decrease in the average unit cost, lower energy usage by the companys full service customers and the regulatory actions referenced above. O&Rs electric operating income decreased $3 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 due primarily to the referenced regulatory actions offset in part by lower depreciation expense and lower revenue and income taxes. Gas O&Rs gas operating revenues increased $7 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase is due primarily to the impact of the 2003 gas rate agreement and higher firm transportation volumes. 69 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Gas sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2004 compared with 2003 were: THOUSANDS OF DTHS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31,2004 December 31,2003 Variation Percent Variation FIRM SALES Residential 9,487 10,810 (1,323 ) (12.2 )% General 2,487 3,314 (827 ) (25.0 ) FIRM TRANSPORTATION 9,931 8,498 1,433 16.9 TOTAL FIRM SALES AND TRANSPORTATION 21,905 22,622 (717 ) (3.2 ) Off Peak/Interruptible Sales 6,996 6,833 163 2.4 NON FIRM TRANSPORTATION OF GAS Generation Plants 659 2,833 (2,174 ) (76.7 ) Other 1,068 1,134 (66 ) (5.8 ) TOTAL SALES AND TRANSPORTATION 30,628 33,422 (2,794 ) (8.4 )% Sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 3.2 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting the impact of the milder winter and warm spring weather. After adjusting for weather variations in each period and the August 2003 power outage, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 0.9 percent higher in 2004 compared with 2003. Non firm transportation of customer owned gas to electric generating plants decreased 76.7 percent in 2004 as compared with 2003 because the relative prices of gas and fuel oil led power plants in the companys gas service area to utilize oil rather than gas for a significant portion of their generation. In addition, one area power plant has changed equipment at its two coal fired units to significantly reduce the volume of gas required for ignition. The decline in gas usage had minimal impact on earnings due to the application of a fixed demand charge for local transportation. Gas operating income was the same in 2004 as in 2003. Increased gas operations and maintenance expenses of $12 million, primarily related to pensions and other postretirement benefits, were offset by an increase in net gas revenues of $7 million, reflecting the 2003 gas rate agreement, and by a decrease in federal and state income tax of $4 million and lower taxes other than income taxes of $1 million. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes decreased $2 million in 2004 compared with 2003. 70 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED The principal components of, and variation, in taxes, other than income taxes were: (Millions of Dollars) 2004 2003 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 29 $ 28 $ 1 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 15 19 (4 ) Payroll taxes 4 4 Other taxes (1 )(b) 1 Total 48 (a) $ 50 (a) $ (2 ) (a) Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes, billed to customers in 2004 and 2003 were $66 million and $69 million, respectively. (b) Includes a sales and use tax refund of approximately $800,000. Income Taxes Operating income taxes decreased by $17 million in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to the deferral of state income tax benefits for ratepayers in 2004 and lower taxable income in 2004 compared with 2003. Other Income O&Rs other income (deductions) increased $3 million in 2004 compared with 2003, due primarily to the reclassification to other income (deductions) in 2003 of losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income related to investments in marketable securities. UNREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER Unregulated Energy Subsidiaries The earnings of the unregulated energy subsidiaries were $12 million lower in 2004 than in 2003. Excluding the effects of asset impairment charges and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, earnings were $20 million lower in 2004. The decrease in earnings reflects several factors, including lower gross margins realized on retail electric sales, a full year of operating expenses associated with generation assets placed in service in mid 2003, and depreciation expense on the Newington plant which was consolidated for financial statement purposes in the last quarter of 2003. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher mark to market gains on forward transactions. Operating revenues of the unregulated energy subsidiaries were $138 million higher in 2004 than in 2003, reflecting principally sales from Con Edison Developments increased generating capacity and higher retail electric sales at Con Edison Solutions. Operating expenses excluding income taxes increased by $129 million, reflecting principally increased purchased power and fuel costs ($192 million), depreciation ($17 million) and maintenance expenses 71 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED ($8 million). This increase was offset in part by lower costs for gas purchased for resale ($32 million), impairment charges recognized at Con Edison Development and Con Edison Solutions in 2003 ($18 million), lower taxes other than income taxes ($6 million) and decreased other operations expense at Con Edison Development ($32 million) due principally to the consolidation accounting associated with the Newington plant. Lease payments were recorded in operations expense in 2003, whereas depreciation and interest expense were charged in 2004 in accordance with consolidation accounting. See Note T to the financial statements. Operating income taxes decreased $6 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 reflecting primarily lower taxable income. Operating income for 2004 was $15 million higher than in 2003. Other income (deductions) increased $4 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 due principally to unrealized gains on derivatives in 2004. Interest charges for 2004 increased by $29 million as compared with 2003 due principally to the additional interest expense attributable to the consolidation of the Newington plant discussed above. Other Earnings attributable to the parent company were $4 million lower in 2004 as compared with 2003 reflecting primarily higher interest expenses. Discontinued Operations Losses from the discontinued operations of Con Edison Communications were $97 million lower in 2004 as compared with 2003 reflecting primarily the impairment charge totaling $84 million (after tax) recorded in 2003. 72 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 The Companies results of operations (which were discussed above under Results of Operations Summary) in 2003 compared with 2002 were: Con Edison* Con Edison of New York O&R (Millions of Dollars) Increases(Decreases) Amount Increases(Decreases) Percent Increases(Decreases) Amount Increases(Decreases) Percent Increases(Decreases) Amount Increases(Decreases) Percent Operating revenues $ 1,310 15.4 % $ 942 13.0 % $ 92 14.5 % Purchased power 683 21.3 502 19.1 31 14.1 Fuel 215 74.4 126 54.3 Gas purchased for resale 293 49.2 243 51.5 31 34.8 Operating revenues less purchased power, fuel and gas purchased for resale (net revenues) 119 2.7 71 1.8 30 9.2 Other operations and maintenance 115 8.7 45 4.0 27 18.9 Impairment charges 18 N/A Depreciation and amortization 29 6.0 20 4.6 Taxes, other than income tax 2 0.2 (2 ) (3.8 ) Income tax (11 ) (2.7 ) 18 5.1 9 36.0 Operating income (34 ) (3.2 ) (12 ) (1.3 ) (4 ) (5.6 ) Other income less deductions and related federal income tax (31 ) (56.4 ) (19 ) (34.5 ) (3 ) Large Net interest charges (10 ) (2.3 ) (16 ) (4.1 ) (7 ) (25.0 ) Income from continuing operations (55 ) (8.0 ) Preferred stock dividend requirements (1 ) (8.3 ) Discontinued operations (88 ) Large Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 25 Large Net income for common stock $ (118 ) (18.3 )% $ (14 ) (2.3 )% $ % *Represents the consolidated financial results of Con Edison and its subsidiaries.

In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full service customers. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A and Regulatory Matters in Note B to the financial statements. CON EDISON OF NEW YORK Electric Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating revenues increased $559 million in 2003 compared with 2002, due primarily to higher fuel and purchased power costs of $503 million (which are recoverable 73 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED from customers), and a lower amount reserved for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return to be retained for customer benefit ($31 million). Changes to operating revenues also reflect variations in electric sales. Con Edison of New Yorks electric sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2003 compared with 2002 were: MILLIONS OF KWHS Twelve Months Ended Percent Variation Description December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Variation Residential/Religious 12,441 12,481 (40 ) (0.3 )% Commercial/Industrial 18,033 19,111 (1,078 ) (5.6 ) Other 154 181 (27 ) (14.9 ) TOTAL FULL SERVICE CUSTOMERS 30,628 31,773 (1,145 ) (3.6 ) Retail access customers 12,637 11,926 711 6.0 SUB TOTAL 43,265 43,699 (434 ) (1.0 ) NYPA, Municipal Agency and Other Sales 10,470 10,267 203 2.0 TOTAL SERVICE AREA 53,735 53,966 (231 ) (0.4 )% Electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area decreased 0.4 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease in delivery volumes reflects the cool weather in the second quarter of 2003 and the lower than normal number of hot days during the summer of 2003 compared with an exceptionally warm summer in 2002, partially offset by the cold winter weather in 2003 compared with the mild winter in 2002. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area increased 0.6 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. Weather adjusted sales represent an estimate of the sales that would have been made if historical average weather conditions had prevailed. Con Edison of New Yorks electric purchased power costs increased $477 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, due to an increase in the average unit price of purchased power. This increase was offset in part by lower usage by the companys full service customers and higher volumes of electricity purchased from other suppliers by participants in the companys retail access programs. Electric fuel costs increased $26 million, reflecting an increase in the average unit price of fuel. Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating income decreased $1 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The principal components of the decrease were increases in other operations and maintenance expense ($41 million due primarily to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement 74 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED benefits), property taxes ($17 million) and depreciation ($16 million). The increases in expense were offset in part by higher net revenues ($56 million), and lower state and local revenue taxes ($7 million), sales and use tax ($5 million) and payroll taxes ($3 million). Gas Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating revenues in 2003 increased $250 million compared with 2002, due primarily to the higher cost of purchased gas of $243 million (which is recoverable from customers), and higher sales volumes. Con Edison of New Yorks revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income.

The increase reflects the impact of the cold weather in the 2003 winter period compared with the mild weather in the 2002 winter period and increased new business. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the companys service area increased 3.6 percent in 2003. Non firm transportation of customer owned gas to NYPA and electric generating plants decreased 34.8 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to higher gas prices. In 2003, because of the relative 75 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED prices of gas and fuel oil, electric generating plants in the companys gas service area utilized oil rather than gas for a significant portion of their generation. The decline in gas usage had minimal impact on earnings due to the application of a fixed demand charge for local transportation. Con Edison of New Yorks purchased gas cost increased $243 million in 2003 compared with 2002, due to higher unit costs and increased sales volumes for firm sales customers. Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating income decreased $10 million in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting primarily increases in other operations and maintenance expense ($4 million due primarily to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement benefits), depreciation ($4 million), state and local taxes on revenues ($5 million) and income tax ($4 million). The increases in expense were offset in part by higher net revenues of $7 million. Steam Con Edison of New Yorks steam operating revenues increased $133 million and steam operating income decreased $1 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The higher revenues reflect higher sales volumes due to the cold winter weather in 2003 as compared with the mild weather in 2002. The increase also includes higher fuel and purchased power costs ($124 million) in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease in steam operating income reflects primarily higher income taxes ($10 million due to higher taxable income and a lower level of removal costs in 2003) and operations and maintenance expense ($3 million due to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement benefits) offset in part by an increase in net revenues ($9 million) and lower state and local taxes on steam revenues ($4 million).

Effective January 2003, New York City increased Con Edison of New Yorks annual property taxes by $94 million. Under the companys rate agreements, the company is deferring most of the property tax increase as a regulatory asset to be recovered from customers. Income Taxes Operating income taxes increased $18 million in 2003 compared with 2002, primarily as a result of less flow through (non deferred) depreciation for tax purposes. In addition, lower operating income taxes in 2002 reflected a tax benefit from an Internal Revenue Service audit for tax years 1995 through 1997 and a write off of excess deferred tax reserves. Other Income Other income (deductions) decreased $19 million in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting $27 million of interest income on a federal income tax refund claim recorded in 2002, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense in 2003 as a result of the recognition in 2002 of income tax benefits relating to the September 2001 sale of the companys nuclear generating unit. Net Interest Charges Net interest charges decreased $16 million in 2003 compared with 2002 due primarily to the interest expense associated with a net federal income tax deficiency related to a prior period audit ($19 million) recorded in 2002. O&R Electric Electric operating revenues increased $54 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase is due primarily to higher purchased power costs in 2003 and accounting for the 2003 New York electric rate agreement and the NJBPU ruling on the 2003 RECO rate petitions. 77 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED O&Rs electric sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2003 compared with 2002 were: MILLIONS OF KWHS Twelve Months Ended Percent Variation Description December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Variation Residential/Religious 1,769 1,815 (46 ) (2.5 )% Commercial/Industrial 2,277 2,393 (116 ) (4.8 ) Other 111 111 TOTAL FULL SERVICE CUSTOMERS 4,157 4,319 (162 ) (3.8 ) Retail access customers 1,455 1,235 220 17.8 TOTAL SERVICE AREA 5,612 5,554 58 1.0 % Electric delivery volumes in O&Rs service area increased 1.0 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 due to the growth in the number of customers, higher average customer usage, and the positive effect of the cooler than normal weather in the first quarter of 2003, partially offset by negative impact of weather on the last nine months of 2003. After adjusting for weather variations and the August 2003 regional power outage, electric delivery volumes in O&Rs service area increased 2.5 percent in 2003. O&Rs purchased power cost increased $31 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to an increase in the average unit cost and the regulatory actions referenced above. This increase was offset by lower energy usage by the companys full service customers and higher volumes of electricity purchased from other suppliers by participants in O&Rs retail access program. O&Rs electric operating income decreased $6 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 due primarily to the referenced regulatory actions. Gas O&Rs gas operating revenues increased $38 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase is due primarily to higher cost for gas purchased for resale in 2003, higher firm sales and transportation volumes and the impact of the 2003 gas rate agreement. 78 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED O&Rs gas sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2003 compared with 2002 were: THOUSANDS OF DTHS Twelve Months Ended Percent Variation Description December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Variation FIRM SALES Residential 10,810 10,203 607 5.9 % General 3,314 3,295 19 0.6 FIRM TRANSPORTATION 8,498 6,368 2,130 33.4 TOTAL FIRM SALES AND TRANSPORTATION 22,622 19,866 2,756 13.9 Off Peak/Interruptible Sales 6,833 7,366 (533 ) (7.2 ) NON FIRM TRANSPORTATION OF GAS Generation Plants 2,833 13,983 (11,150 ) (79.7 ) Other 1,134 1,057 77 7.3 TOTAL SALES AND TRANSPORTATION 33,422 42,272 (8,850 ) (20.9 )% O&Rs sales and transportation volumes for firm customers increased 13.9 percent in 2003 compared with 2002.

Revenues from gas sales in New York are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. After adjusting for weather variations in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 3.0 percent higher in 2003 compared with 2002. Non firm transportation of customer owned gas to electric generating plants decreased 79.7 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to higher gas prices. In 2003, because of the relative prices of gas and fuel oil, power plants in the companys gas service area utilized oil rather than gas for a significant portion of their generation. In addition, one area power plant completed a construction project to directly connect to a gas transmission provider. The decline in gas usage had minimal impact on earnings due to the application of a fixed demand charge for local transportation. O&Rs cost of gas purchased for resale increased $31 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to increased sales to firm customers and increased gas unit costs in 2003. The increase is offset in part by increased volumes of gas purchased from other suppliers by participants in O&Rs retail access program. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements. Gas operating income increased $2 million in 2003 as compared with 2002. The increase reflects an increase in net gas revenues of $7 million, which is due primarily to increased sales and the referenced regulatory actions. The increase in net revenues was offset in part by increased gas operations and maintenance expenses of $2 million and increased federal and state income tax of $3 million. 79 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R) CONTINUED Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes decreased $2 million in 2003 compared with 2002.

Income Taxes Operating income taxes increased by $9 million in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting primarily to the result of less flow through (non deferred) depreciation for tax purposes. Other Income O&Rs other income (deductions) decreased $3 million in 2003 compared with 2002, due primarily to the reclassification to other income (deductions) of losses related to marketable securities which were previously recognized in other comprehensive income.
