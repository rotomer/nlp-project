ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ( COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) This combined managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) relates to the consolidated financial statements included in this report of two separate registrants: Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) and Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York) and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto. As used in this report, the term the Companies refers to Con Edison and Con Edison of New York. Con Edison of New York is a subsidiary of Con Edison and, as such, information in this MD&A about Con Edison of New York applies to Con Edison. Information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements referred to in this discussion and analysis is incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as see or refer to shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made. Corporate Overview Con Edisons principal business operations are those of its utility companies, Con Edison of New York and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R), together known as the Utilities. Con Edison also has competitive businesses that compete primarily in energy related businesses (see Competitive Energy Businesses, below). Certain financial data of Con Edisons businesses is presented below: Twelve months endedDecember 31, 2005 AtDecember 31,2005 (Millions of Dollars) OperatingRevenues Net Income Assets Con Edison of New York $ 9,272 79% $ 694 97 % $ 21,146 85% O&R 824 7% 49 7 % 1,588 6% Total Utilities 10,096 86% 743 104 % 22,734 91% Con Edison Development 512 4% (6 ) (1)% 1,240 5% Con Edison Energy 52 1% 2 % 208 1% Con Edison Solutions 1,040 9% 5 1 % 139 1% Other (a) (10 ) % (12 ) (2)% 469 2% Total continuing operations 11,690 100% 732 102 % 24,790 100% Discontinued operations (b) % (13 ) (2)% 60 % Total Con Edison $ 11,690 100% $ 719 100 % $ 24,850 100% (a) Represents inter company and parent company accounting. (b) Represents the discontinued operations of Con Edison Communications. Con Edisons net income for common stock in 2005 was $719 million or $2.95 a share. Net income for common stock in 2004 and 2003 was $537 million or $2.28 a share and $528 million or $2.39 a share, respectively. The 2005 results reflect increased energy sales and deliveries, the electric rate plan that took effect in April 2005 and the gas and steam rate plans that took effect in October 2004. See Results of Operations Summary, below. Con Edisons principal business segments are Con Edison of New Yorks regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities, O&Rs regulated electric and gas utility activities and Con Edisons competitive businesses. Con Edison of New Yorks principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities. For segment financial information, see Note O to the financial statements and Results of Operations, below. For information about factors that could have a material adverse effect on the Companies, see Risk Factors, below. Regulated Utilities Con Edison of New York provides electric service to approximately 3.2 million customers and gas service to approximately 1.1 million customers in New York City and Westchester County. The company also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. O&R, along with its regulated utility businesses, provides electric service to approximately 0.3 million customers in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of northern New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania and gas service to over 0.1 million customers in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of eastern Pennsylvania. The Utilities are primarily wires and pipes energy delivery businesses that deliver energy in their service areas subject to extensive federal and state regulation. The Utilities customers buy this energy from the Utilities, or from other suppliers through the Utilities retail access programs. The Utilities purchase substantially all of the energy they sell to customers pursuant to firm contracts or through wholesale energy markets, and recover (generally on a current basis) the cost of the energy sold, pursuant to approved rate plans. Con Edison anticipates that the Utilities will continue to provide substantially all of its earnings over the next few years. The Utilities earnings will depend on various factors including demand for utility service and the Utilities ability to charge rates for their services that reflect the costs of service, including a return on invested equity capital. The factors affecting demand for utility service include weather, market prices for energy and economic conditions. Because the energy delivery infrastructure must be adequate to meet demand in peak periods with a high level of reliability, the Utilities capital investment plans reflect in great part actual growth in electric peak demand adjusted to summer design weather conditions, as well as forecast growth in peak usage. 25 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED The Utilities had estimated prior to the summer of 2005 that, under design weather conditions, the 2005 peak electric demand in their respective service areas would be 13,025 MW for Con Edison of New York and 1,500 MW for O&R. On July 27, 2005, the electric demands served by the Utilities reached new record peaks, 13,059 MW for Con Edison of New York, and 1,539 MW for O&R. The higher than forecasted demands were primarily due to increased customer demand and actual temperatures that were slightly higher than those used in developing the forecast. Also, on July 27, 2005, the NYISO invoked demand reduction programs. Without these reduction programs, the experienced peak demands would have been higher. The average annual growth rate of the peak electric demand over the next five years at design conditions is estimated to be approximately 1.5 percent for Con Edison of New York and 2.7 percent for O&R. Since demand reduction programs are invoked only in specific circumstances, design conditions do not include their potential impact. The Companies anticipate an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to meet this growth in peak usage with the high level of reliability that the Utilities currently provide (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Requirements, below). The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the rates they can charge their customers. Con Edison of New Yorks electric, gas and steam rate plans are effective through March 31, 2008, September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively. The company has filed a request for a new steam rate plan to be effective October 1, 2006. O&R has rate plans for its electric and gas services in New York that extend through October 31, 2006. O&R has filed a request for a new gas rate plan to be effective November 1, 2006. Pursuant to the Utilities rate plans, charges to customers may not be changed during the respective terms of the rate plans other than for recovery of the costs incurred for energy supply, for specified increases provided in the rate plans and for limited other exceptions. The rate plans generally require the Utilities to share with customers earnings in excess of specified rates of return on equity. Changes in delivery volumes are reflected in operating income (except to the extent that weather normalization provisions apply to the gas businesses and subject to provisions in the rate plans for sharing above target earnings with customers). See Regulatory Matters below and Recoverable Energy Costs and Rate and Restructuring Agreements in Notes A and B, respectively, to the financial statements. Accounting rules and regulations for public utilities include Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," pursuant to which the economic effects of rate regulation are reflected in financial statements. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies, below. Competitive Energy Businesses Con Edisons competitive energy businesses participate in competitive businesses and are subject to different risks than the Utilities. In view of conditions affecting certain of its competitive activities, the company recognized an impairment charge of $18 million ($10 million after tax) for certain generating assets in 2003. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies, below. At December 31, 2005, Con Edisons investment in its competitive energy businesses was $543 million and their assets amounted to $1.6 billion. Consolidated Edison Solutions, Inc. (Con Edison Solutions) sells electricity to delivery customers of the Utilities and other utilities primarily in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic regions and also offers energy related services. The company sold approximately 10 million megawatt hours of electricity to customers in 2005. Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. (Con Edison Development) owns and operates generating plants and participates in other infrastructure projects. At December 31, 2005, the company owned the equivalent of 1,668 MW of capacity in electric generating facilities of which 203 MW is sold under long term purchase power agreements and the balance is sold on the wholesale electricity markets. Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc. (Con Edison Energy) provides energy and capacity to Con Edison Solutions and others and markets the output of plants owned or operated by Con Edison Development. The company also provides risk management services to Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison Development and offers these services to others. Over the next two years the competitive energy businesses will focus on increasing their customer base, gross margins and the value of their existing assets. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Requirements and Capital Resources, below. Discontinued Operations In December 2005, Con Edison signed an agreement to sell Con Edison Communications, LLC (Con Edison Communications) to RCN Corporation. See Note U to the financial statements. Results of Operations Summary Con Edisons earnings per share in 2005 were $2.95 ($2.94 on a diluted basis). In 2004, earnings per share were $2.28 ($2.27 on a diluted basis). Earnings per share in 2003 were $2.39 ($2.38 on a diluted basis). 26 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Net income for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2003 Con Edison of New York $ 694 $ 518 (a) $ 591 O&R 49 46 45 Con Edison Development (6 ) (4 ) (9 )(b) Con Edison Energy 2 1 Con Edison Solutions 5 3 19 Other (c) (12 ) (14 ) (10 ) Total continuing operations 732 549 637 Discontinued operations (d) (13 )(e) (12 ) (109 )(e) Con Edison $ 719 $ 537 $ 528 (a) Net income for Con Edison of New York in 2004 includes charges totaling $80 million after tax in accordance with Con Edison of New Yorks electric, gas and steam rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements. (b) Net income for Con Edison Development includes a charge for the impairment of two combustion turbines and a generation investment totaling $10 million after tax. It also includes a benefit for the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for mark to market gains related to certain power sales contracts, partially offset by a $3 million net after tax impact of financial statement consolidation of the Newington plant. (c) Other consists of inter company and parent company accounting including interest expense on debt and the related income tax expense. (d) Discontinued operations represent Con Edison Communications operations. See Note U to the financial statements. (e) Net income from discontinued operations includes charges for the impairment of Con Edison Communications assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144 of $5 million and $84 million after tax in 2005 and 2003, respectively. Con Edisons net income in 2005 was $182 million higher than in 2004, reflecting the following factors (after tax, in millions): Con Edison of New York: Impact of weather in 2005 on net revenues versus 2004 (estimated) $ 40 Sales growth (estimated) 37 Electric rate plan (estimated) 170 Gas rate plan (estimated) 33 Steam rate plan (estimated) 47 Increased pension and other post retirement benefits costs (45 ) Higher depreciation and property tax expense (88 ) Higher operations and maintenance expense (61 ) Allowance for funds used during construction (26 ) 2004 non cash rate plan charges 80 Other (11 ) Total Con Edison of New York 176 O&R 3 Competitive energy businesses including parent company 4 Loss on discontinued operations, including impairment recognized in 2005 (1 ) Total $ 182 Con Edisons net income in 2004 was $9 million higher than in 2003, reflecting the following factors (after tax, in millions): Con Edison of New York: Impact of weather in 2004 on net revenues versus 2003 (estimated) $ (5 ) Sales growth and other revenue factors (estimated) 35 Increased pension and other post retirement benefits costs (18 ) Regulatory accounting (12 ) Higher depreciation and property tax expense (32 ) Higher operations and maintenance expense (27 ) Lower interest expense, principally long term debt 14 Allowance for funds used during construction and other income 21 Electric, gas and steam rate plan charges (80 ) Settlement in 2003 regarding nuclear generating unit sold in 2001 5 Other, principally tax benefits 26 Total Con Edison of New York (73 ) O&R 1 Competitive energy businesses including parent company (23 ) Competitive generating asset impairments 10 Loss on discontinued operations, including impairment recognized in 2003 97 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles (3 ) Total $ 9 See Results of Operations below for further discussion and analysis of results of operations. Risk Factors The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. These risk factors include: The Utilities Revenues And Results Of Operations Reflect Regulatory Actions The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the prices they can charge their customers. The prices generally may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than for the recovery of energy costs and limited other exceptions. The rate plans generally include earnings adjustments for meeting or failing to meet certain standards. Certain of the plans require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. Regulators may also take actions affecting the company outside of the framework of the approved rate plans. The regulators in the states in which the Utilities provide service generally permit the Utilities to recover from their customers the cost of service, other than any cost that is determined to have been imprudently incurred. The Utilities regulatory filings can involve complex accounting and other calculations. See Application of Critical Accounting Polices and Regulatory Matters, below. 27 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Con Edisons Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Is Subject To Regulatory Restrictions Con Edisons ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its businesses. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are generally limited to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See Dividends in Note C to the financial statements. The Companies Purchase Energy For Their Customers A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or in the Companies energy supply arrangements could adversely affect their ability to meet their customers energy needs and the Companies results of operations. The Companies have policies to manage the economic risks related to energy supply, including related hedging transactions and the risk of a counterpartys non performance. The Utilities generally recover their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including the cost of hedging transactions, in accordance with rate provisions approved by state regulators. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses enter into hedging transactions to manage their commodity related price and volumetric risks. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks Commodity Price Risk, below. Energy Market Prices Have Increased Significantly The impact of higher energy market prices on the Companies is mitigated by their energy management policies and rate provisions pursuant to which the Utilities recover energy supply costs. However, higher energy market prices are resulting in significant increases in energy costs billed to customers that could result in decreased energy usage. If this were to occur, the Companies would have decreased energy delivery revenues. The higher prices of electricity, fuel oil and gas could also affect the value of Con Edisons competitive energy businesses generating facilities. The Utilities Have A Substantial Ongoing Utility Construction Program The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $5.3 billion over the next three years. The ongoing construction program includes large energy transmission and distribution system projects. The failure to complete these projects in a timely manner could adversely affect the Utilities ability to meet their customers growing energy needs with the high level of reliability that they currently provide. The Utilities expect to use internally generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison and external borrowing to fund the construction expenditures. Changes in capital market conditions or in the Companies credit ratings could adversely affect their ability and their cost to borrow funds. The Companies commercial paper and unsecured debt are rated by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. (Moodys), Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). The current ratings are shown in Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources, below. The Companies Operate Essential Energy Facilities And Other Systems The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities that are located either in, or close to, public places. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. The Companies have information systems relating to their operations, billing, accounting and other matters, the failure of which could adversely affect the Companies operations and liquidity. In the event of failure or damage to these facilities or systems, the Utilities could incur substantial liability, higher costs and increased regulatory requirements. The Utilities have training, operating, security, maintenance and capital programs designed to provide for the safe and reliable operation of their energy facilities and information systems. Con Edisons Competitive Energy Businesses Are In Evolving Markets Con Edisons competitive energy businesses are active in evolving markets that are affected by the actions of governmental agencies, other organizations (such as independent system operators) and other competitive businesses. Compared to the Utilities, the profitability of their products and services and the recoverability of Con Edisons investment in these competitive businesses is not as predictable. The Companies May Be Affected By The Application Of Critical Accounting Policies And Rules The application of the Companies critical accounting policies reflects complex judgments, assumptions and estimates. These policies, which are described in Application of Critical Accounting Policies, below, include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities, the accounting and funding rules applicable to pensions and other post retirement benefits, and accounting for contingencies, long lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases. New accounting policies or rules or changes to current accounting policies, rules or interpretations of such policies or rules that affect the Companies financial statements may be adopted by the relevant accounting or other authorities. Con Edison Is Engaged In A Material Legal Proceeding With Northeast Utilities In 2001, Con Edison sued Northeast Utilities to recover damages from its breach of the merger agreement with them and to seek the courts declaration that Con Edison had no further obligations under the merger agreement. Northeast Utilities alleges Con Edison breached the merger 28 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED agreement and has been pursuing a counter claim against Con Edison for damages in excess of $1.2 billion. There are also claims by purported classes of Northeast Utilities shareholders seeking damages from Con Edison that the company believes to be substantially duplicative of those sought by Northeast Utilities. See Note H to the financial statements. The Companies Are Exposed To Risks Relating To Environmental Matters Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See Environmental Matters, below and Note G to the financial statements. Electric and magnetic fields (EMF) are found wherever electricity is used. If a causal relationship between EMF and adverse health effects were established, there could be a material adverse effect on the Companies. Negative perceptions about EMF can make it more difficult to construct facilities needed for the Companies operations. The Companies Are Subject To Extensive Government Regulation And Taxation The Companies operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. The Companies federal income tax returns reflect certain tax positions with which the Internal Revenue Service, which has completed its audits of the tax returns through 1996, does not or may not agree. See Notes K and M to the financial statements. The Companies may be subject to new laws or regulations or the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies. The Companies Face Weather And Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control The Companies results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather, which directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam and can affect the price of energy commodities. The cost of repairing damage to the Companies facilities and the potential disruption of their operations due to storms, natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts and other catastrophic events could be substantial. The occurrence or risk of occurrence of future terrorist attacks or related acts of war could also adversely affect the New York or United States economy. A lower level of economic activity for these or other reasons could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could adversely affect the Companies revenues and earnings and limit the Companies future growth prospects. Forward Looking Statements This report includes forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward looking statements are statements of future expectation and not facts. Words such as expects, estimates, anticipates, intends, believes, plans, will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are based on information available at the time the statements are made, and accordingly speak only as of that time. Actual results or developments might differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements because of various factors such as those discussed under Risk Factors, above. Application of Critical Accounting Policies The Companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies critical accounting policies include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases. Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities SFAS No. 71 The Utilities are subject to SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction. SFAS No. 71 specifies the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under SFAS No. 71. The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in Note B to the financial statements. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission. 29 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED In the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery (as required by SFAS No. 71), these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December 31, 2005, the regulatory assets for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. Con Edisons competitive businesses also provide such benefits to certain of their employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes E and F to the financial statements for information about these assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Primarily because of the amortization of previous years net investment gains, Con Edison of New Yorks pension expense for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was negative, resulting in a credit to and increase in net income in each year. Investment gains and losses on plan assets are fully recognized in expense over a 15 year period (20 percent of the gains and losses for each year begin to amortize in each of the following five years and the amortization period for each 20 percent portion of the gains and losses is ten years). This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) and is permitted under SFAS No. 87. The cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets and assumptions for future periods. Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks current estimates for 2006 are increases, compared with 2005, in their pension and other postretirement benefits cost of $74 million and $67 million, respectively. The increases reflect the amortization of prior period actuarial losses associated with declines in the market value of assets in recent years, a change in the discount rate assumption from 5.9 percent in 2005 to 5.7 percent in 2006 and a decrease in the expected return on plan assets from 8.8 percent in 2005 to 8.5 percent in 2006. Generally, to the extent pension and other postretirement benefit costs vary from the amounts reflected in rates for such costs, the difference will be deferred in accordance with current rate agreements. See Note B to the financial statements. Amortization of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to increase Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks pension and other postretirement benefit costs by an additional $12 million in 2007. A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2006, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 8.5 percent would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York by approximately $15 million in 2007. The discount rate is determined using a model to match the durations of highly rated (Aa and Aaa, by Moodys) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments. Due to declines in bond yields and interest rates, the company reduced the discount rate used to calculate 2005 pension and other postretirement benefit costs to 5.9% compared to 6.3% and 6.75% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In determining the health care cost trend rate, the company reviews actual recent cost trends and projected future trends. 30 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED The following table illustrates the effect on 2005 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant: ActuarialAssumption Change inAssumption Pension Other Postretirement Benefits Total (Millions of Dollars) Increase in accounting cost: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 28 $ 3 $ 31 Con Edison of New York (0.25 %) $ 26 $ 2 $ 28 Expected return on plan assets Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 18 $ 2 $ 20 Con Edison of New York (0.25 %) $ 18 $ 2 $ 20 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % N/A $ 3 $ 3 Con Edison of New York 1.00 % N/A $ 1 $ 1 Increase in projected benefit obligation: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 268 $ 39 $ 307 Con Edison of New York (0.25 %) $ 250 $ 34 $ 284 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % N/A $ 36 $ 36 Con Edison of New York 1.00 % N/A $ 17 $ 17 Pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which Con Edison of New York, O&R and the competitive businesses make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets. An actuarial valuation of Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks plan funded status as of December 31, 2005, showed that the fair value of the plans assets exceeded the plans accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) by $214 million and $418, respectively, at that date. However, the fair market value of the plan assets could fall below the plans ABO in future years. In that event, each of the Companies would be required, under SFAS No. 87, to accrue a liability equal in amount to the difference between its share of the fair value of the plan assets and its portion of the ABO, plus, in the case of Con Edison of New York, its total prepaid pension costs, through a non cash charge to other comprehensive income (OCI). The charge to OCI, which would be net of taxes, would not affect net income for common stock. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to their pension plans in 2005 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, Con Edison of New York, O&R and Con Edisons competitive businesses made discretionary contributions of $2 million, $31 million and $1 million, respectively, to the plan in 2005. In 2006, Con Edison of New York, O&R and Con Edisons competitive businesses expect to make discretionary contributions of $34 million, $35 million and $1 million, respectively. The Companies policy is to fund their pension and postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible. Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, applies to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include the Utilities responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G); certain tax matters (Notes K and M); legal proceedings relating to Con Edisons 1999 merger agreement with Northeast Utilities (Note H); and other contingencies (Note I). In accordance with SFAS No. 5, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated. The Utilities recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings. Accounting for Long Lived Assets SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under SFAS No. 144 an 31 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value. Con Edisons competitive businesses test their assets for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying amount might not be recoverable. A critical element of this test is the forecast of future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the long lived assets. Forecast of these cash flows requires complex judgments about future operations, which are particularly difficult to make with respect to evolving industries such as the energy related and telecommunications businesses. Under SFAS No. 144, if alternative courses of action are under consideration or if a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows, the probability of all possible outcomes must be weighted. With respect to the forecasted cash flows associated with Con Edison Developments generation facilities, a 10 percent decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for these facilities would not result in an impairment charge. As a result of the tests performed in 2003, Con Edison recognized impairment charges of $159 million ($94 million after tax) for the assets of its competitive telecommunications and generation businesses. No impairments were identified by the 2004 tests. As a result of the 2005 tests, Con Edison recognized impairment charges of $9 million ($5 million after tax) with respect to its telecommunications assets. In order to establish the fair value of the assets, the agreement to sell Con Edison Communications to RCN for $32 million was used. See Note U to the financial statements. Accounting for Goodwill In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Con Edison is required to annually test goodwill for impairment. See Note L to the financial statements. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill. The goodwill of $406 million at December 31, 2005, was most recently tested for impairment during the first quarter of 2005. This test did not require any second step assessment and did not result in any impairment. The companys most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values. The company estimated fair values based primarily on discounted cash flows. A decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10 percent would not have resulted in the carrying value of any reporting units exceeding their estimated fair values. Accounting for Derivative Instruments The Companies apply SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, and other related accounting pronouncements to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below and Note P to the financial statements. Where the Companies are required to make mark to market estimates pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources. Accounting for Leases The Companies apply SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and other related pronouncements to their leasing transactions. See Note K to the financial statements for information about Con Edison Developments Lease In/Lease Out or LILO transactions, a disallowance of tax losses by the Internal Revenue Service and a possible future charge to earnings. In accordance with SFAS No. 13, Con Edison accounted for the two LILO transactions as leveraged leases. Accordingly, the companys investment in these leases, net of non recourse debt, is carried as a single amount in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet and income is recognized pursuant to a method that incorporates a level rate of return for those years when net investment in the lease is positive, based upon the after tax cash flows projected at the inception of the leveraged leases. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below. 32 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED The principal factors affecting Con Edisons liquidity are its investments in the Utilities, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities. In addition, in 2004 and 2003, Con Edison issued 16.7 million and 11.9 million shares of common stock for $578 and $436 million, respectively, of which $512 million and $378 million were invested in Con Edison of New York. Con Edison also issued $200 million of five year debt in 2003, most of the proceeds of which were invested in its competitive businesses. The principal factors affecting Con Edison of New Yorks liquidity are its cash flows from operations, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures) and cash flows from financing activities discussed below. Con Edison of New Yorks expenditures have included approximately $513 million related to the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center and the subsequent restoration of lower Manhattan energy services and facilities; to date the company has received reimbursement of $76 million of such costs from insurance carriers and $93 million from the federal government and is pursuing further reimbursement of such costs. See Note I to the financial statements. The Companies current liabilities exceeded their current assets at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short term borrowing to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short term borrowings using funds from long term financings and operating activities. The Utilities cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers. Each of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short term and long term cash requirements. See Risk Factors, and Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies, above, and Regulatory Matters, below. Changes in the Companies cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are summarized as follows: Con Edison (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 Variance 2005vs. 2004 2003 Variance 2004vs. 2003 Operating activities $ 793 $ 1,311 $ (518 ) $ 1,309 $ 2 Investing activities (1,277 ) (1,531 ) 254 (1,534 ) 3 Financing activities 539 197 342 156 41 Net change for the period 55 (23 ) 78 (69 ) 46 Balance at beginning of period 26 49 (23 ) 118 (69 ) Balance at end of period $ 81 $ 26 $ 55 $ 49 $ (23 ) Con Edison of New York (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 Variance 2005vs. 2004 2003 Variance 2004vs. 2003 Operating activities $ 818 $ 1,201 $ (383 ) $ 1,169 $ 32 Investing activities (1,167 ) (1,412 ) 245 (1,337 ) (75 ) Financing activities 400 188 212 113 75 Net change for the period 51 (23 ) 74 (55 ) 32 Balance at beginning of period 10 33 (23 ) 88 (55 ) Balance at end of period $ 61 $ 10 $ 51 $ 33 $ (23 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities The Utilities cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is dependent primarily on factors external to the Utilities, such as weather and economic conditions. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate plans. In general, changes in the Utilities cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements. Net income is the result of cash and non cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies cash flows from operating activities. Principal non cash charges include depreciation, Con Edisons impairment charges in 2005 and 2003, and in 2004 charges in accordance with Con Edison of New Yorks rate plans. For Con Edison of New York, principal non cash credits included prepaid pension costs and in 2005, amortizations of certain net regulatory liabilities, including the tax 33 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED effects, in accordance with its current electric rate plan. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits and Notes E and F to the financial statements. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2005 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $518 million and $383 million lower, respectively, than in 2004. The decrease reflects primarily prepayment of New York City property taxes and an increase in customer accounts receivable, offset in part by increases in accounts payable. The increase in prepayments reflects a New York City program under which Con Edison of New York achieved a 1.5 percent reduction in its City property taxes for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006 by prepaying the taxes on June 30, 2005 instead of paying them in semi annual installments on their due dates (July 1, 2005 and January 1, 2006). The increases in customer accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect primarily higher energy market prices and higher sales and delivery volumes. See Changes in Assets and Liabilities, below. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2004 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $2 million lower and $32 million higher than 2003, respectively. The change at Con Edison of New York reflects lower accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2004 as compared with year end 2003 partially offset by an increase in materials and supplies. Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $254 million and $245 million lower, respectively, in 2005 than in the 2004, reflecting primarily $534 million of net proceeds from the completion in May 2005 of the sale of Con Edison of New York properties located on First Avenue in Manhattan, collectively referred to as the First Avenue Properties (see Other Regulatory Matters in Note B to the financial statements), partially offset by increased utility construction expenditures. Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison were $3 million lower in 2004 than in 2003, due primarily to lower construction expenditures by its competitive businesses, partially offset by increased construction expenditures by the Utilities. Cash flows used in investing activities were $75 million higher in 2004 than in 2003 for Con Edison of New York due primarily to increased construction expenditures. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York increased $342 million and $212 million in 2005 compared with 2004, and increased $41 million and $75 million, respectively, in 2004 compared with 2003. Con Edisons cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, reflect the issuance through public offerings of 14 million and 9.6 million Con Edison common shares resulting in proceeds of $512 million and $378 million, respectively, which were invested by Con Edison in Con Edison of New York. Cash flows from financing activities in 2003 also reflect the issuance of $200 million of Con Edisons 3.625 percent 5 year debentures, most of which was invested in the competitive businesses. Cash flows from financing activities for 2005, 2004 and 2003 also reflect the issuance of Con Edison common shares through its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans (2005: 2.8 million shares for $78 million, 2004: 2.7 million shares for $66 million; 2003: 2.3 million shares for $58 million). In addition, as a result of the stock plan issuances, cash used to pay common stock dividends was reduced by $38 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $40 million in 2003. Net cash flows from financing activities during the years ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 also reflect the following Con Edison of New York transactions: 2005 Issued $350 million 5.3% 30 year debentures, $125 million 5.25% 30 year debentures and $350 million 5.375% 10 year debentures, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes; Redeemed at maturity $100 million 6.625% 10 year debentures and $350 million 6.625% 5 year debentures; and Issued note for $126 million of variable rate, tax exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds due 2039, the proceeds of which were used together with other funds to redeem in advance of maturity $128 million 6.10% fixed rate tax exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds due 2020. 2004 Issued notes for $344 million of variable rate, tax exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, with various maturity dates between 28 and 35 years, the proceeds of which were used to redeem in advance of maturity fixed rate tax exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, 5.25% due 2020, 5.375% due 2022, 6.0% due 2028 and 7.125% due 2029; Issued $200 million 4.7% 10 year debentures and $200 million 5.7% 30 year debentures, the proceeds of which were used to redeem in advance of maturity $150 million 7.125% debentures due 2029 and for general corporate purposes; Redeemed at maturity $150 million 7.625% 12 year debentures; and 34 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Issued $275 million 4.7% 5 year debentures, the proceeds of which were used in July to redeem in advance of maturity $275 million 7.35% 40 year debentures. 2003 Redeemed in advance of maturity $275 million 7.75% 35 year Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2031 using cash held for that purpose at December 31, 2002; Redeemed at maturity $150 million 6.375% 10 year debentures and issued $175 million 5.875% 30 year debentures; and Redeemed $380 million 7.5% 30 year debentures due 2023 using the net proceeds from the issuance of $200 million 3.85% 10 year debentures and $200 million 5.10% 30 year debentures. Con Edisons net cash flows from financing activities also include O&Rs financings. In 2005, O&R issued $40 million 5.3% 10 year debentures. In 2004, $46 million of 5.22% Transition Bonds associated with securitization of previously deferred purchased power costs of O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary were issued. In 2003, O&R redeemed at maturity $35 million of 6.56% 10 year debentures. Cash flows from financing activities of the Companies also reflect commercial paper issuance (included on the consolidated balance sheets as Notes payable). The commercial paper amounts outstanding at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 and the average daily balances for 2005, 2004 and 2003 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were as follows: (Millions ofDollars,exceptWeightedAverage Yield) 2005 2004 2003 Out standingatDec. 31 Dailyaverage Out standingatDec. 31 Dailyaverage Out standingatDec. 31 Dailyaverage Con Edison $ 755 $ 210 $ 156 $ 166 $ 156 $ 326 Con Edison of New York $ 520 $ 118 $ 100 $ 126 $ 99 $ 179 Weighted average yield 4.3 % 3.3 % 2.2 % 1.2 % 1.0 % 1.2 % External borrowings are a source of liquidity that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital markets. For information about the Companies credit ratings and certain financial ratios, see Capital Resources, below. Changes in Assets and Liabilities The following table shows changes in assets and liabilities at December 31, 2005, compared with December 31, 2004, that have impacted the Companies consolidated statements of cash flows. The changes in these balances are used to reconcile income to cash flow from operations. (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison2005 vs. 2004Variance Con Edison ofNew York2005 vs. 2004Variance Assets Fair value of derivative assets $ 265 $ 157 Prepayments 341 344 Accounts receivable net 284 214 Other receivables net 152 113 Liabilities Deferred derivative gains 201 162 Accounts payable 316 277 Other current liabilities 158 172 Fair value of derivative liabilities 109 In the context of increasing energy market prices, the Companies policies for managing their energy purchases resulted in an increase in the fair value of derivative assets (included in the consolidated balance sheets as a current asset) at December 31, 2005 as compared with year end 2004. For the Utilities, the mark to market gains had no effect on net income as the gains were deferred as regulatory liabilities (deferred derivative gains). In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers their energy supply costs, net of gains and losses on derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchases. The mark to market accounting for Con Edisons competitive energy businesses forward sales of electricity from their generating plants resulted in an increase in the fair value of derivative liabilities. The competitive energy businesses record mark to market gains and losses on derivative instruments in earnings in the reporting period in which such changes occur. The increase in the Companies prepayments at December 31, 2005 as compared with year end 2004 reflects primarily the prepayment of New York City property taxes as discussed above in Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Accounts receivable net of allowance for uncollectibles increased at December 31, 2005 as compared with year end 2004 due primarily to the impact of higher energy market prices on full service customers bills. The increase in the Companies other receivables reflects Con Edison of New Yorks purchase of accounts receivable from authorized electricity and gas providers in its service territory (also known as energy service companies) pursuant to a program established in accordance with Con Edison of New 35 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Yorks rate plans. The increase also reflects a property tax refund claim relating to the East River Repowering Project. Accounts payable increased at December 31, 2005 as compared with year end 2004 due primarily to the impact of higher energy market prices. Other current liabilities increased at December 31, 2005 as compared with year end 2004 due primarily to increases in the collateral of $57 million received by the Companies in energy market transactions. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks Credit Risk, below. In addition, the increase reflects Con Edison of New Yorks purchase of accounts receivable from authorized electricity and gas providers in its service territory in accordance with its rate plans. Capital Resources Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily from dividends it receives from its subsidiaries and through the sale of securities, including commercial paper and the issuance in 2006 of between $250 million and $450 million of Con Edison common shares in addition to stock issuances under its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans. Con Edisons ability to make payments on its external borrowings and dividends on its common shares is also dependent on its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its interests in its subsidiaries. For information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see Note C to the financial statements. For information on the Companies commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see Note D to the financial statements. The Utilities expect to finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally generated funds, contributions of equity capital from Con Edison and external borrowings. In May 2005, the PSC authorized Con Edison of New York to issue up to $4.4 billion of debt securities prior to December 31, 2009. In January 2006, the PSC authorized O&R to issue up to $325 million of debt securities prior to December 31, 2009. In addition, the PSC has authorized the refunding of the Utilities outstanding debt securities and preferred stock, should the Utilities determine that it is economic to do so. Con Edisons competitive businesses have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions and borrowings from Con Edison, internally generated funds and external borrowings. See Note Q to the financial statements. For each of the Companies, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges (Securities and Exchange Commission basis) for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, and 2001 was: Earnings to FixedCharges Ratio 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Con Edison 3.1 2.6 3.1 3.1 3.4 Con Edison of New York 3.7 3.1 3.4 3.4 3.7 For each of the Companies, the common equity ratio at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was: Common Equity Ratio 2005 2004 2003 Con Edison 49.0 51.0 48.0 Con Edison of New York 50.7 52.9 49.3 The commercial paper of the Companies is rated P 1, A 1 and F1, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. Con Edisons unsecured debt is rated A2, A and A, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. The unsecured debt of the Utilities is rated A1, A and A+, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 36 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Capital Requirements The following table contains the Companies capital requirements for the years 2003 through 2005 and estimated amounts for 2006 through 2008. Actual Estimate* (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Regulated utility construction expenditures Con Edison of New York $ 1,167 $ 1,235 $ 1,541 $ 1,725 $ 1,722 $ 1,550 O&R 71 79 87 102 110 114 Total regulated construction expenditures 1,238 1,314 1,628 1,827 1,832 1,664 Competitive businesses construction expenditures 105 38 19 6 6 6 Sub total 1,343 1,352 1,647 1,833 1,838 1,670 Retirement of long term securities at maturity** Con Edison parent company 200 Con Edison of New York 805 923 578 330 280 O&R 35 2 2 22 3 Competitive energy businesses 16 16 17 20 22 24 Total retirement of long term securities at maturity 856 939 597 22 374 507 Total $ 2,199 $ 2,291 $ 2,244 $ 1,855 $ 2,212 $ 2,177 * Excludes discontinued operations. ** Includes long term securities redeemed in advance of maturity. Con Edison of New Yorks utility construction expenditures in 2003 and 2004 reflect programs to meet growth in the demand for electricity and reliability needs, gas infrastructure expenditures, the East River Repowering Project and expenditures for permanent electric, gas and steam system restoration following the 2001 World Trade Center attack (see Note I to the financial statements). The increases in 2005 reflect a higher level of expenditures for electric substations and ongoing improvements and reinforcements of the electric distribution system. The competitive energy businesses construction expenditures declined in 2004 and 2005, and are expected to decline in 2006. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Con Edisons investment balance in these businesses, on an unconsolidated basis, was $543 million and $599 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Companies material obligations at December 31, 2005, to make payments pursuant to contracts. Long term debt, capital lease obligations and other long term liabilities are included on their balance sheets. Operating leases, non utility generator (NUG) contracts and other purchased power agreements (PPAs) (for which undiscounted future annual payments are shown) are described in the notes to the financial statements.

(b) Included in these amounts is the cost of minimum quantities of natural gas supply, transportation and storage that the Utilities are obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. (c) Amounts shown for other purchase obligations, which reflect capital and operations and maintenance costs incurred by the Utilities in running their day to day operations, were derived from the Utilities purchasing systems as the difference between the amounts authorized and the amounts paid (or vouchered to be paid) for each obligation. For many of these obligations, the Utilities are committed to purchase less than the amount authorized. Payments for the other purchase obligations are generally assumed to be made ratably over the term of the obligations. The Utilities believe that unreasonable effort and expense would be involved to modify their purchasing systems to enable them to report their other purchase obligations in a different manner. (d) Amounts represent commitments to purchase minimum quantities of electric energy and capacity, natural gas, natural gas pipeline capacity and generating plant services entered into by Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. Amounts do not include commitments of Con Edison Communications. 38 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED The Companies commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments include their other liabilities reflected in their balance sheets, any funding obligations for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans, their collective bargaining agreements and Con Edisons guarantees of certain obligations of its businesses. See Notes E, F, Q and Guarantees in Note I to the financial statements. Electric Power Requirements In 2005, the Utilities purchased substantially all of the energy they sold to customers pursuant to firm contracts and through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market. Con Edison expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2006. In general, the Utilities recover prudently incurred purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks Commodity Price Risk, below and Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements. From time to time certain parties have petitioned the PSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity. To reduce the volatility of electric energy costs, the Utilities have firm contracts to purchase electric energy and enter into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of their expected purchases under these contracts and through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market, which together cover a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to customers in 2006. See Notes J and P to the financial statements. O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary entered into firm contracts to purchase electric energy for substantially all of the electric energy expected to be sold to its customers in 2006. Con Edison of New York also owns generating stations in New York City associated primarily with its steam system. As of December 31, 2005, the generating stations had a combined electric capacity of approximately 692 MW. In April 2005, the companys East River Repowering Project was placed in service, adding 292 MW (on a summer nominal rating) of in City electric capacity. Also in 2005, the company retired its Waterside generating station, reducing its electric capacity by 167 MW. The company sells the electric output of its generating stations through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market. O&R does not own any electric generating capacity. In a July 1998 order, the PSC indicated that it agree(s) generally that Con Edison of New York need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops, but considers overly broad and did not adopt Con Edison of New Yorks request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, it will no longer be required to engage in long range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of capacity. Con Edison of New York monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO. For information about transmission issues arising from the proposed closure of the Lovett generating station located in O&Rs service territory see Generating Assets Sold to Mirant in Note I to the financial statements. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses sell electricity to wholesale and retail customers in the NYISO and other markets. In addition, at December 31, 2005, Con Edison Development owns equity interests in electric generating facilities equivalent to 1,668 MW of net generating capacity, substantially all of which is located within the PJM Interconnection or the New England Power Pool.

Also see Note B to the financial statements for a description of the pending Con Edison of New York steam rate filing and the pending O&R gas rate filing. The Companies are actively participating in regulatory proceedings at the federal level that are underway to implement the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Act provides for the establishment of an Electric Reliability Organization to implement mandatory reliability standards, implementation of transmission pricing incentives, numerous studies regarding economic dispatch and transmission system needs, changes to market manipulation standards for electricity and natural gas and other changes that could impact the Companies businesses in the future. Financial and Commodity Market Risks The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk. Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. The Companies estimate that each 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks variable rate debt and commercial paper would result in a change in annual interest expense of $5 million and $4 million, respectively. In addition, from time to time, Con Edison and its businesses enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See Interest Rate Hedging in Note P to the financial statements. 40 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Commodity Price Risk Con Edisons commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note P to the financial statements. Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2005, each 10 percent change in market prices would result in a change in fair value of $161 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $130 million is for Con Edison of New York and $31 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses use a value at risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of instruments or the portfolio due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. These businesses estimate VaR across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for transactions associated with hedges on generating assets and commodity contracts, assuming a one day holding period, for the years ended December 31, 2005, and 2004, respectively, was as follows: 95% Confidence Level,One Day Holding Period 2005 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Average for the period $ 3 $ 1 High 15 3 Low 1 1 Credit Risk The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to over the counter transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. Credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterpartys nonperformance. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, netting provisions within agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements. The Companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff. The Utilities had $272 million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral and reserves, at December 31, 2005, of which $175 million was with investment grade counterparties and $97 million was with the New York Mercantile Exchange. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses had $158 million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral and reserves, at December 31, 2005, of which $133 million was with investment grade counterparties and $11 million was with commodity exchanges or independent system operators. The remaining $14 million was with entities which lacked ratings or whose ratings were not investment grade. Investment Risk The Companies investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, above. The Companies current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 65 percent equities and 35 percent fixed income and other securities. At December 31, 2005, the pension plan investments consisted of 67 percent equity and 33 percent fixed income and other securities. See Note E to the financial statements. Environmental Matters For information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos, see Note G to the financial statements. Impact of Inflation The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies long term debt in dollars of 41 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. Also, to the extent the Companies prices change by more or less than inflation, the real price of the Companies services will increase or decline. Over the past 20 years, for example, the real price of electric service has declined substantially. Material Contingencies For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies material contingencies, see Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies and Notes G, H, I, K and M to the financial statements. Results of Operations Results of operations reflect, among other things, the Companies accounting policies (see Application of Critical Accounting Policies, above), rate plans that cover the rates the Utilities can charge their customers (see Regulatory Matters, above) and demand for utility service. Demand for utility service is affected by weather, economic conditions and other factors. The Companies results of operations for the 12 months ended December 31, 2005 reflect higher net revenues resulting from the warmer than normal summer weather, growth in energy deliveries and the Con Edison of New York electric rate plan that became effective April 1, 2005 and gas and steam rate plans that became effective October 1, 2004. The higher net revenues were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses, and a reduction in net credits for pensions and other postretirement benefits. In addition, depreciation and property taxes were higher in 2005, reflecting large continuing investments in energy delivery infrastructure. For Con Edison, results of operations also reflect accounting for the discontinued operations of Con Edison Communications. For additional information about major factors affecting earnings, see Results of Operations Summary, above. In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full service customers (see Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A and Regulatory Matters in Note B to the financial statements). Accordingly, such costs do not generally affect the Companies results of operations. Management uses the term net revenues (operating revenues less such costs) to identify changes in operating revenues that may affect the Companies results of operations. Management believes that, although net revenues may not be a measure determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the measure facilitates the analysis by management and investors of the Companies results of operations. A discussion of the results of operations by principal business segment for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 follows. For additional business segment financial information, see Note O to the financial statements. 42 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2004 The Companies results of operations (which were discussed above under Results of Operations Summary) in 2005 compared with 2004 were: Con Edison* Con Edison of New York O&R Competitive Businessesand Other** (Millions of Dollars) Increases(Decreases)Amount Increases(Decreases)Percent Increases(Decreases)Amount Increases(Decreases)Percent Increases(Decreases)Amount Increases(Decreases)Percent Increases(Decreases)Amount Increases(Decreases)Percent Operating revenues $ 1,932 19.8 % $ 1,266 15.8 % $ 121 17.2 % $ 545 52.0 % Purchased power 783 19.8 303 9.9 74 30.1 406 62.5 Fuel 219 36.7 122 30.2 97 50.3 Gas purchased for resale 303 35.6 256 36.1 23 19.2 24 Large Operating revenues less purchased power, fuel and gas purchased for resale (net revenues) 627 14.4 585 15.3 24 7.1 18 9.8 Other operations and maintenance 190 12.7 187 15.2 3 1.7 Depreciation and amortization 33 6.0 32 6.7 1 3.0 Taxes, other than income taxes 105 9.7 101 10.0 (1 ) (2.1 ) 5 26.3 Income taxes 72 24.7 49 17.5 14 82.4 9 Large Operating income 227 24.4 216 26.2 7 10.8 4 9.8 Other income less deductions and related federal income tax (24 ) (38.7 ) (25 ) (47.2 ) 1 5.3 Net interest charges 20 4.5 15 4.3 4 20.0 1 1.3 Income from continuing operations 183 33.3 176 34.0 3 6.5 4 26.7 Discontinued operations (1 ) (8.3 ) N/A N/A N/A N/A (1 ) (8.3 ) Net income $ 182 33.9 % $ 176 34.0 % $ 3 6.5 % $ 3 11.1 % * Represents the consolidated financial results of Con Edison and its businesses. ** Includes inter company and parent company accounting. Con Edison of New York Electric Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating revenues were $840 million higher in 2005 than in 2004, due primarily to increased recoverable purchased power and fuel costs ($415 million), warmer summer weather and sales growth ($119 million), the electric rate plan that took effect in April 2005 ($282 million), the charge in 2004 to resolve certain issues relating primarily to the treatment of prior period pension credits ($100 million) and recovery of costs relating to the East River Repowering Project ($54 million), offset in part by lower revenue taxes ($76 million; see State Income Tax in Note A to the financial statements), and provision for refund to customers of shared earnings above the target level ($53 million). Con Edison of New Yorks electric sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2005 compared with 2004 were: Millions of kWhs Twelve Months Ended Percent Variation Description December 31,2005 December 31, 2004 Variation Residential/Religious 13,690 12,673 1,017 8.0 % Commercial/Industrial 15,402 16,966 (1,564 ) (9.2 ) Other 252 229 23 10.0 Total Full Service Customers 29,344 29,868 (524 ) (1.8 ) Retail access customers 16,848 14,143 2,705 19.1 Sub total 46,192 44,011 2,181 5.0 NYPA, Municipal Agency and Other Sales 11,144 10,730 414 3.9 Total Service Area 57,336 54,741 2,595 4.7 % 43 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Electric sales and delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area increased 4.7 percent in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily reflecting warmer weather in the 2005 summer period compared with 2004 weather, growth in usage by existing customers and increased new business. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, electric sales and delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area increased 2.4 percent in 2005 compared with 2004. Con Edison of New Yorks electric purchased power costs increased $295 million in 2005 compared with the 2004 period reflecting an increase in unit costs, partially offset by decreased purchased volumes associated with additional customers obtaining their energy supply through competitive providers. Electric fuel costs increased $120 million, reflecting higher sendout volumes from the companys generating facilities and an increase in unit costs. Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating income increased $133 million in 2005 compared with 2004. The increase reflects higher net revenues ($423 million) due principally to warm weather and the new electric rate plan, offset in part by higher operations and maintenance costs ($200 million, due primarily to lower pension credits and higher costs addressed in the electric rate plan), taxes other than income taxes ($77 million, principally property taxes), depreciation ($11 million) and income taxes ($2 million). Gas Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating revenues in 2005 increased $327 million compared with 2004, reflecting primarily an increase in recoverable gas costs ($256 million), the gas rate plan ($54 million) and the effect of the 2004 charge to resolve certain issues relating primarily to the treatment of prior period pension credits ($18 million). Con Edison of New Yorks revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. Con Edison of New Yorks gas sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2005 compared with 2004 were: Thousands of DTHs Twelve Months Ended PercentVariation Description December 31,2005 December 31,2004 Variation Firm Sales Residential 48,175 48,569 (394 ) (0.8 )% General 36,800 35,887 913 2.5 Firm Transportation 19,088 16,795 2,293 13.7 Total Firm Sales and Transportation 104,063 101,251 2,812 2.8 Off Peak/Interruptible Sales 13,128 13,187 (59 ) (0.4 ) Non Firm Transportation of Gas NYPA 22,305 18,623 3,682 19.8 Generation Plants 48,564 44,772 3,792 8.5 Total NYPA and Generation Plants 70,869 63,395 7,474 11.8 Other 18,103 18,534 (431 ) (2.3 ) Total Sales and Transportation 206,163 196,367 9,796 5.0 % Con Edison of New Yorks sales and transportation volumes for firm customers increased 2.8 percent in 2005 compared with 2004 reflecting primarily increased new business and changes in service classification to firm from interruptible for certain customers that were no longer eligible for interruptible service, partially offset by the impact of the milder winter in the 2005 period. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the companys service area increased 2.4 percent in the 2005 period. Con Edison of New Yorks purchased gas cost increased $256 million in 2005 compared with 2004 due to higher unit costs and higher sendout. Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating income increased $18 million in 2005 compared with 2004, reflecting primarily higher net revenues ($72 million) as a result of the October 2004 gas rate plan. This increase was partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense ($27 million, due primarily to lower pension credits and higher costs addressed in the gas rate plan), 44 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED taxes other than income taxes ($18 million, principally property taxes), income taxes ($7 million) and depreciation ($1 million). Steam Con Edison of New Yorks steam operating revenues increased $99 million in 2005 compared with 2004, due primarily to the net increase in rates under the steam rate plan ($50 million), recovery from customers of costs associated with the East River Repowering Project ($28 million), the effect of the 2004 charge to resolve certain issues relating primarily to the treatment of prior period pension credits ($6 million), higher fuel and purchased power costs ($10 million) and a charge related to distribution losses in 2004 ($4 million).

After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, steam sales and deliveries increased 1.8 percent in 2005. Con Edison of New Yorks steam purchased power costs increased $8 million in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher unit costs, offset in part by lower purchased volumes. Steam fuel costs increased $2 million due primarily to higher sendout volumes, offset in part by savings resulting from the operation of the East River Repowering Project. Steam operating income increased $66 million in 2005 compared with 2004. The increase is due to higher net revenues resulting from the steam rate plan ($60 million) and the recovery of costs related to the East River Repowering Project ($82 million), offset in part by higher income tax ($38 million), operations and maintenance expenses ($12 million), depreciation expense ($19 million) and taxes other than income taxes ($6 million, principally property taxes). Taxes Other Than Income Taxes At over $1 billion, taxes other than income taxes remain one of Con Edison of New Yorks largest operating expenses. The principal components of, and variations in, taxes, other than income taxes were: (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 796 $ 681 $ 115 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 267 283 (16 ) Payroll taxes 52 53 (1 ) Other taxes (1 ) (4 ) 3 Total $ 1,114 (a) $ 1,013 (a) $ 101 (a) Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customers in 2005 and 2004 were $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Income Taxes Operating income taxes increased $49 million in 2005 compared with 2004, due principally to higher income in the 2005 period. Other Income (Deductions) Other income (deductions) decreased $25 million in 2005 compared with 2004, due primarily to decreased allowance for equity funds used during construction related to the commencement of commercial operation of the East River Repowering Project. Net Interest Charges Net interest charges increased $15 million in 2005 compared with 2004, due principally to higher interest rates on variable rate debt and additional interest expense on long term debt issued in 2005. O&R Electric O&Rs electric operating revenues increased $97 million in 2005 compared with 2004, due primarily to increased recoverable purchased power costs, higher sales and deliveries in 2005 and a one time adjustment for unbilled revenues recorded in March 2005, offset in part by a reserve for earnings in excess of target level in accordance with its New York electric rate plan. 45 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED O&Rs electric sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2005 compared with 2004 were: Millions of kWhs Twelve Months Ended Percent Variation Description December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 Variation Residential/Religious 1,905 1,729 176 10.2 % Commercial/Industrial 2,276 2,046 230 11.2 Other 114 107 7 6.5 Total Full Service Customers 4,295 3,882 413 10.6 Retail access customers 1,836 1,861 (25 ) (1.3 ) Total Service Area 6,131 5,743 388 6.8 % Electric sales and delivery volumes in O&Rs service area in 2005 increased 6.8 percent compared with 2004 due primarily to the warmer summer weather, growth in the number of customers, and the unbilled revenue adjustment referenced above. Absent this adjustment and after adjusting for weather variations in each period, electric delivery volumes in O&Rs service area increased 2.3 percent in 2005. O&Rs purchased power costs increased $74 million in 2005 compared with 2004 due to an increase in the average unit cost and higher delivery volumes. Electric operating income increased by $7 million in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher net revenues ($23 million), offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses ($3 million) and income taxes ($12 million). Gas O&Rs gas operating revenues increased $24 million in 2005 compared with 2004. The increase is due primarily to higher costs of gas purchased for resale in 2005. O&Rs revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. O&Rs gas sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2005 compared with 2004 were: Thousands of DTHs Twelve Months Ended Percent Variation Description December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 Variation Firm Sales Residential 9,307 9,487 (180 ) (1.9 )% General 2,269 2,487 (218 ) (8.8 ) Firm Transportation 9,841 9,931 (90 ) (0.9 ) Total Firm Sales and Transportation 21,417 21,905 (488 ) (2.2 ) Off Peak/Interruptible Sales 6,458 6,996 (538 ) (7.7 ) Non Firm Transportation of Gas Generation Plants 1,434 659 775 Large Other 1,072 1,068 4 0.4 Total Sales and Transportation 30,381 30,628 (247 ) (0.8 )% Sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 2.2 percent in 2005 compared with 2004 reflecting the impact of the milder winter weather. After adjusting for weather variations in each period, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 0.7 percent higher for 2005 than in 2004. Non firm transportation of customer owned gas to electric generating plants increased substantially in 2005 compared with 2004 due to higher demand for generation related to the warmer than normal summer. The increase in gas usage had minimal impact on earnings because most revenues from these customers result from a fixed demand charge for local transportation. Gas operating income was the same in 2005 as in 2004. 46 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes decreased $1 million in 2005 compared with 2004.

Income Taxes Operating income taxes increased by $14 million in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to the deferral of state income tax benefits for ratepayers in 2004 and higher taxable income in 2005 compared with 2004. Net Interest Expense O&Rs net interest expense increased by $4 million in 2005 compared with 2004, reflecting interest on the $40 million 5.3% 10 year debentures issued in March 2005 and the Transition Bonds associated with securitization of previously deferred purchased power costs of O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary. Competitive Businesses and Other Competitive Energy Businesses The earnings of the competitive energy businesses were $2 million higher in 2005 than in 2004. Operating revenues of the competitive energy businesses were $534 million higher in 2005 than in 2004, reflecting principally higher retail sales and prices of electricity. Operating expenses excluding income taxes increased by $520 million, reflecting principally increased purchased power ($394 million), fuel ($97 million) and gas purchased for resale costs ($25 million) and taxes other than income taxes ($5 million). Income taxes increased $3 million in 2005, reflecting primarily higher income. Operating income for 2005 was $11 million higher than in 2004. Other income (deductions) decreased $10 million in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to unrealized mark to market losses, compared with gains in 2004. Other Other includes the activity of the parent company and inter company eliminations relating to operating revenues and operating expenses. Discontinued Operations Losses from the discontinued operations of Con Edison Communications were $1 million higher in 2005 than in 2004 reflecting primarily an after tax impairment charge of $5 million, offset in part by the cessation of depreciation.

Con Edison of New York Electric Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating revenues were $181 million lower in 2004 than in 2003, due primarily to the non cash charge ($100 million) under the electric rate plan effective April 2005 (see Note B to the financial statements) and decreased purchased power costs of $80 million. The decrease is partially offset by the increase in recoverable fuel costs ($46 million). Changes to operating revenues also reflect variations in electric sales. Con Edison of New Yorks electric sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2004 compared with 2003 were: Millions of kWhs Twelve Months Ended Percent Variation Description December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 Variation Residential/Religious 12,673 12,441 232 1.9 % Commercial/Industrial 16,966 18,033 (1,067 ) (5.9 ) Other 229 154 75 48.7 Total Full Service Customers 29,868 30,628 (760 ) (2.5 ) Retail access customers 14,143 12,637 1,506 11.9 Sub total 44,011 43,265 746 1.7 NYPA, Municipal Agency and Other Sales 10,730 10,470 260 2.5 Total Service Area 54,741 53,735 1,006 1.9 % 48 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area increased 1.9 percent in 2004 compared with 2003, reflecting principally increased new business. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area increased 1.4 percent in 2004 compared with 2003. Weather adjusted sales represent an estimate of the sales that would have been made if historical average weather conditions had prevailed. Con Edison of New Yorks electric fuel costs increased $46 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because the companys generation plants were dispatched more frequently than in the same period last year. Electric purchased power costs decreased $80 million, reflecting a decrease in purchased volumes, partially offset by higher unit costs. Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating income decreased $106 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The principal components of the decrease were lower net revenues ($147 million), and increases in other operations and maintenance expense ($49 million due primarily to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement benefits), property taxes ($21 million) and depreciation ($16 million). The increases in expense were offset in part by lower income tax ($80 million), state and local revenue taxes ($32 million), sales and use tax ($8 million). Gas Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating revenues in 2004 increased $8 million compared with 2003, reflecting primarily higher firm and non firm revenues due principally to the gas rate plan ($23 million) and the reconciliation of gas distribution losses to levels reflected in rates, which resulted in a net benefit of $12 million. This increase was partially offset by non cash charge ($18 million) under the gas rate plan (see Note B to the financial statements). Con Edison of New Yorks revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. Con Edison of New Yorks gas sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2004 compared with 2003 were: Thousands of DTHs Twelve Months Ended PercentVariation Description December 31,2004 December 31,2003 Variation Firm Sales Residential 48,569 51,944 (3,375 ) (6.5 )% General 35,887 36,840 (953 ) (2.6 ) Firm Trans portation 16,795 16,486 309 1.9 Total Firm Sales and Trans portation 101,251 105,270 (4,019 ) (3.8 ) Off Peak/Interruptible Sales 13,187 15,247 (2,060 ) (13.5 ) Non Firm Trans portation of Gas NYPA 18,623 23,360 (4,737 ) (20.3 ) Generation Plants 44,772 43,808 964 2.2 Total NYPA and Generation Plants 63,395 67,168 (3,773 ) (5.6 ) Other 18,534 17,766 768 4.3 Total Sales and Trans portation 196,367 205,451 (9,084 ) (4.4 )% Con Edison of New Yorks sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 3.8 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting the impact of milder winter and warmer spring weather, partially offset by increased new business. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the companys service area increased 0.6 percent in 2004. Non firm transportation of customer owned gas to NYPA and electric generating plants decreased 5.6 percent in 2004 as compared with 2003 due to higher gas prices. In 2004, because of the relative prices of gas and fuel oil, electric generating plants in the companys gas service area utilized oil rather than gas for a significant portion of their generation. The decline in gas usage had minimal impact on earnings due to the application of a fixed demand charge for local transportation. Con Edison of New Yorks purchased gas cost decreased $6 million in 2004 compared with 2003, due to lower delivery volumes, partially offset by higher unit costs. 49 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating income increased $3 million in 2004 compared with 2003, reflecting primarily higher net revenues ($14 million) and lower sales and use tax ($1 million). This increase was partially offset by increases in other operations and maintenance expense ($8 million due primarily to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement benefits), depreciation ($3 million) and income tax ($3 million). Steam Con Edison of New Yorks steam operating revenues increased $13 million and steam operating income decreased $13 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase includes higher purchased power costs ($20 million) in 2004 reflecting an increase in purchased volumes and higher unit costs compared with 2003, partially offset by the non cash charge ($6 million) under the steam rate plan (see Note B to the financial statements). The decrease in steam operating income reflects increased operations and maintenance expense ($19 million, principally related to the cost of insulating steam manhole covers) and lower net revenues of $7 million. This decrease was partially offset by lower income taxes ($15 million) due to lower income. Con Edison of New Yorks steam sales and deliveries in 2004 compared with 2003 were: Millions of Pounds Twelve Months Ended PercentVariation Description December 31,2004 December 31,2003 Variation General 685 729 (44 ) (6.0 )% Apartment house 7,602 7,845 (243 ) (3.1 ) Annual power 17,842 17,674 168 1.0 Total Sales 26,129 26,248 (119 ) (0.5 )% Steam sales volumes decreased 0.5 percent in 2004 compared with 2003, reflecting the impact of the milder December weather in the 2004 period. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, steam sales decreased 0.4 percent in 2004. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes The principal components of, and variations in, taxes, other than income taxes were: (Millions of Dollars) 2004 2003 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 681 $ 651 $ 30 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 283 321 (38 ) Payroll taxes 53 50 3 Other taxes (4 ) 18 (22 ) Total $ 1,013 (a) $ 1,040 (a) $ (27 ) (a) Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customer in 2004 and 2003 were $1,357 and $1,393 million, respectively. Income Taxes Operating income taxes decreased $92 million in 2004 compared with 2003, due principally to lower income in the 2004 period. Other Income (Deductions) Other income (deductions) increased $17 million in 2004 compared with 2003, due primarily to increased allowance for equity funds used during construction and interest income associated with use tax and federal income tax. Net Interest Charges Net interest charges decreased $27 million in 2004 compared with 2003, due principally to lower interest expense on long term debt as a result of refinancing long term debt at lower interest rates, offset, in part, by additional debt issuances during the year. O&R Electric O&Rs electric operating revenues decreased $31 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The decrease is due primarily to accounting in 2003 for the New York rate agreement and the NJBPU ruling on the RECO rate petitions (see Rate and Restructuring Agreements in Note B to the financial statements), as well as the deferral in 2004 of state income tax benefits for ratepayers, and lower purchased power costs. 50 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED O&Rs electric sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2004 compared with 2003 were: Millions of kWhs Twelve Months Ended Description December 31,2004 December 31,2003 Variation PercentValuation Residential/Religious 1,729 1,769 (40 ) (2.3 )% Commercial/Industrial 2,046 2,277 (231 ) (10.1 ) Other 107 111 (4 ) (3.6 ) Total Full Service Customers 3,882 4,157 (275 ) (6.6 ) Retail access customers 1,861 1,455 406 27.9 Total Service Area 5,743 5,612 131 2.3 % Electric delivery volumes in O&Rs service area increased 2.3 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 due to the growth in the number of customers and higher average customer usage. After adjusting for weather variations in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, electric delivery volumes in O&Rs service area increased 2.3 percent in 2004. O&Rs purchased power cost decreased $5 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 due to a decrease in the average unit cost, lower energy usage by the companys full service customers and the regulatory actions referenced above. O&Rs electric operating income decreased $3 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 due primarily to the referenced regulatory actions offset in part by lower depreciation expense and lower revenue and income taxes. Gas O&Rs gas operating revenues increased $7 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase is due primarily to the impact of the 2003 gas rate agreement and higher firm transportation volumes. O&Rs gas sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2004 compared with 2003 were: Thousands of DTHs Twelve Months Ended Percent Variation Description December 31,2004 December 31,2003 Variation Firm Sales Residential 9,487 10,810 (1,323 ) (12.2 )% General 2,487 3,314 (827 ) (25.0 ) Firm Transportation 9,931 8,498 1,433 16.9 Total Firm Sales and Transportation 21,905 22,622 (717 ) (3.2 ) Off Peak/Interruptible Sales 6,996 6,833 163 2.4 Non Firm Transportation of Gas Generation Plants 659 2,833 (2,174 ) (76.7 ) Other 1,068 1,134 (66 ) (5.8 ) Total Sales and Transportation 30,628 33,422 (2,794 ) (8.4 )% Sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 3.2 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting the impact of the milder winter and warm spring weather. After adjusting for weather variations in each period and the August 2003 power outage, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 0.9 percent higher in 2004 compared with 2003. Non firm transportation of customer owned gas to electric generating plants decreased 76.7 percent in 2004 as compared with 2003 because the relative prices of gas and fuel oil led power plants in the companys gas service area to utilize oil rather than gas for a significant portion of their generation. In addition, one area power plant has changed equipment at its two coal fired units to significantly reduce the volume of gas required for ignition. The decline in gas usage had minimal impact on earnings due to the application of a fixed demand charge for local transportation. Gas operating income was the same in 2004 as in 2003. Increased gas operations and maintenance expenses of $12 million, primarily related to pensions and other postretirement benefits, were offset by an increase in net gas revenues of $7 million, reflecting the 2003 gas rate agreement, and by a decrease in federal and state income tax of $4 million and lower taxes other than income taxes of $1 million. 51 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes decreased $2 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The principal components of, and variation, in taxes, other than income taxes were: (Millions of Dollars) 2004 2003 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 29 $ 28 $ 1 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 15 19 (4 ) Payroll taxes 4 4 Other taxes (1 )(b) 1 Total $ 48 (a) $ 50 (a) $ (2 ) (a) Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes, billed to customers in 2004 and 2003 were $66 million and $69 million, respectively. (b) Includes a sales and use tax refund of approximately $800,000. Income Taxes Operating income taxes decreased by $17 million in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to the deferral of state income tax benefits for ratepayers in 2004 and lower taxable income in 2004 compared with 2003. Other Income O&Rs other income (deductions) increased $3 million in 2004 compared with 2003, due primarily to the reclassification to other income (deductions) in 2003 of losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income related to investments in marketable securities. Competitive Businesses and Other Competitive Energy Businesses The earnings of the competitive energy businesses were $12 million lower in 2004 than in 2003. Excluding the effects of asset impairment charges and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, earnings were $20 million lower in 2004. The decrease in earnings reflects several factors, including lower gross margins realized on retail electric sales, a full year of operating expenses associated with generation assets placed in service in mid 2003, and depreciation expense on the Newington plant which was consolidated for financial statement purposes in the last quarter of 2003. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher mark to market gains on forward transactions. Operating revenues of the competitive energy businesses were $138 million higher in 2004 than in 2003, reflecting principally sales from Con Edison Developments increased generating capacity and higher retail electric sales at Con Edison Solutions. Operating expenses excluding income taxes increased by $129 million, reflecting principally increased purchased power and fuel costs ($192 million), depreciation ($17 million) and maintenance expenses ($8 million). This increase was offset in part by lower costs for gas purchased for resale ($32 million), impairment charges recognized at Con Edison Development and Con Edison Solutions in 2003 ($18 million), lower taxes other than income taxes ($6 million) and decreased other operations expense at Con Edison Development ($32 million) due principally to the consolidation accounting associated with the Newington plant. Lease payments were recorded in operations expense in 2003, whereas depreciation and interest expense were charged in 2004 in accordance with consolidation accounting. See Note T to the financial statements. Operating income taxes decreased $6 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 reflecting primarily lower taxable income. Operating income for 2004 was $15 million higher than in 2003. Other income (deductions) increased $4 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 due principally to unrealized gains on derivatives in 2004. Interest charges for 2004 increased by $29 million as compared with 2003 due principally to the additional interest expense attributable to the consolidation of the Newington plant discussed above. Other Earnings attributable to the parent company were $4 million lower in 2004 as compared with 2003 reflecting primarily higher interest expenses. Discontinued Operations Losses from the discontinued operations of Con Edison Communications were $97 million lower in 2004 as compared with 2003 reflecting primarily the impairment charge totaling $84 million (after tax) recorded in 2003. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.
