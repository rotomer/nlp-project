ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) This combined managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) relates to the consolidated financial statements included in this report of two separate registrants: Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) and Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York) and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto. As used in this report, the term the Companies refers to Con Edison and Con Edison of New York. Con Edison of New York is a subsidiary of Con Edison and, as such, information in this MD&A about Con Edison of New York applies to Con Edison. Information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements referred to in this discussion and analysis is incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as "see" or "refer to" shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made. Corporate Overview Con Edisons principal business operations are those of its utility companies, Con Edison of New York and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R), together known as the Utilities. Con Edison also has competitive energy businesses (see Competitive Energy Businesses, below). Certain financial data of Con Edisons businesses is presented below: Twelve months endedDecember 31, 2007 AtDecember 31,2007 (Millions of Dollars) OperatingRevenues NetIncome Assets Con Edison of New York $ 9,885 75% $ 844 91% $ 24,559 87% O&R 936 7% 46 5% 1,862 6% Total Utilities 10,821 82% 890 96% 26,421 93% Con Edison Development(a) 899 7% 29 3% 377 1% Con Edison Energy(a) 34 % % 183 1% Con Edison Solutions(a) 1,383 11% 29 3% 204 1% Other(b) (17 ) % (23 ) (2)% 252 1% Total continuing operations 13,120 100% 925 100% 27,437 97% Discontinued operations/held for sale(c) % 4 % 906 3% Total Con Edison $ 13,120 100% $ 929 100% $ 28,343 100% (a) Net income from continuing operations of the competitive energy businesses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 includes $(5) million of net after tax mark to market gains/(losses) (Con Edison Development, $(16) million and Con Edison Solutions, $11 million). (b) Represents inter company and parent company accounting. See Results of Operations, below. (c) Represents the discontinued operations of Con Edison Development. Con Edisons net income for common stock in 2007 was $929 million or $3.49 a share. Net income for common stock in 2006 and 2005 was $737 million or $2.96 a share and $719 million or $2.95 a share, respectively. See Results of Operations Summary, below. Con Edisons principal business segments are Con Edison of New Yorks regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities, O&Rs regulated electric and gas utility activities and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. Con Edison of New Yorks principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities. For segment financial information, see Note N to the financial statements and Results of Operations, below. For information about factors that could have a material adverse effect on the Companies, see Risk Factors, below. Regulated Utilities Con Edison of New York provides electric service to approximately 3.2 million customers and gas service to approximately 1.1 million customers in New York City and Westchester County. The company also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. O&R, along with its regulated utility businesses, provides electric service to approximately 0.3 million customers in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of northern New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania and gas service to over 0.1 million customers in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of eastern Pennsylvania. The Utilities are primarily wires and pipes energy delivery businesses that deliver energy in their service areas subject to extensive federal and state regulation. The Utilities customers buy this energy from the Utilities, or from other suppliers through the Utilities retail access programs. The Utilities purchase substantially all of the energy they sell to customers pursuant to firm contracts or through wholesale energy markets, and recover (generally on a current basis) the cost of the energy sold, pursuant to approved rate plans. Con Edison anticipates that the Utilities will continue to provide substantially all of its earnings over the next few years. The Utilities earnings will depend on various factors including demand for utility service and the Utilities ability to charge rates for their services that reflect the costs of service, including a return on invested equity capital. The factors affecting demand for utility service include growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy, economic conditions and measures that promote energy efficiency. Demand for electric service peaks during the summer air conditioning season. Demand for gas and steam service peaks during the winter heating season. 28 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Because the energy delivery infrastructure must be adequate to meet demand in peak periods with a high level of reliability, the Utilities capital investment plans reflect in great part past actual electric peak demand adjusted to summer design weather conditions, as well as forecast growth in peak usage. The weather during the summer of 2007 was cooler than design conditions. The highest peak electric demand reached in 2007 was 12,807 MW for Con Edison of New York on August 8, 2007 and 1,474 MW for O&R on July 10, 2007. The Utilities estimate that, under design weather conditions, the 2008 peak electric demand in their respective service areas will be 13,775 MW for Con Edison of New York and 1,645 MW for O&R. The Con Edison of New York forecasted peak demand includes the impact of permanent demand reduction programs. The average annual growth rate of the peak electric demand over the next five years at design conditions is estimated to be approximately 1.2 percent for Con Edison of New York and 2.5 percent for O&R. The Companies anticipate an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to meet this growth in peak usage with the high level of reliability that they currently provide (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Requirements, below). The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the rates they can charge their customers. Con Edison of New Yorks electric, gas and steam rate plans are effective through March 31, 2008, September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2008, respectively. In May 2007, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) for new electric rates to be effective April 1, 2008. In November 2007, Con Edison of New York filed a request for a new steam rate plan, to be effective October 1, 2008. O&Rs rate plans for its electric and gas service in New York and its subsidiarys electric service in New Jersey extend through June 30, 2008, October 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010, respectively. In August 2007, O&R filed for new electric rates for its New York customers to be effective July 10, 2008. Pursuant to the Utilities rate plans, charges to customers generally may not be changed during the respective terms of the rate plans other than for recovery of the costs incurred for energy supply, for specified increases provided in the rate plans and for limited other exceptions. The New York rate plans generally require the Utilities to share with customers earnings in excess of specified rates of return on common equity capital. Changes in delivery volumes are reflected in operating income (except to the extent that weather normalization or revenue decoupling provisions apply to the gas businesses, and subject to provisions in the rate plans for sharing above target earnings with customers). See Regulatory Matters below and Recoverable Energy Costs and Rate Agreements in Notes A and B, respectively, to the financial statements. Accounting rules and regulations for public utilities include Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," pursuant to which the economic effects of rate regulation are reflected in financial statements. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies, below. Competitive Energy Businesses Con Edisons competitive energy businesses participate in segments of the electricity industry that are less comprehensively regulated than the Utilities. These segments include the operation of electric generation facilities, trading of electricity and fuel, sales of electricity to wholesale and retail customers and sales of certain energy related goods and services. At December 31, 2007, Con Edisons equity investment in its competitive energy businesses was $615 million and their assets, including those held for sale (see below), amounted to $1.7 billion. Consolidated Edison Solutions, Inc. (Con Edison Solutions) sells electricity directly to delivery service customers of utilities primarily in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic regions (including some of the Utilities customers) and also offers energy related services. Con Edison Solutions does not sell electricity to the Utilities. The company sold approximately 12.2 million MWHs of electricity to customers in 2007. Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. (Con Edison Development) owns, leases or operates generating plants and participates in other infrastructure projects. At December 31, 2007, the company owned or leased the equivalent of 1,739 MWs of capacity in electric generating facilities of which 203 MWs are sold under long term purchase power agreements and the balance is sold on the wholesale electricity markets. In addition, the company sells electricity at wholesale to utilities. In December 2007, Con Edison Development and its subsidiary, CED/SCS Newington, LLC, agreed to sell their ownership interests in power generating projects with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,706 MW. See Note U to the financial statements. Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc. (Con Edison Energy) procures electric energy and capacity for Con Edison Solutions and fuel for Con Edison Development and others. It sells the electric capacity and energy produced by plants owned, leased or operated by Con Edison Development and others. The company also provides energy risk management services to Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison Development, offers these services to others and enters into wholesale supply transactions. The competitive energy businesses are focusing on increasing their customer base and gross margins and completing the sale 29 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED of the generating projects discussed above. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Requirements and Capital Resources, below. Discontinued Operations In March 2006, Con Edison completed the sale of Con Edison Communications, LLC (Con Edison Communications) to RCN Corporation. In December 2007, Con Edison Development and its subsidiary, CED/SCS Newington, LLC, agreed to sell their ownership interests in power generating projects with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,706 MW. See Notes T and U to the financial statements. Results of Operations Summary Con Edisons earnings per share in 2007 were $3.49 ($3.47 on a diluted basis). In 2006, earnings per share were $2.96 ($2.95 on a diluted basis). Earnings per share in 2005 were $2.95 ($2.94 on a diluted basis). Net income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2005 Con Edison of New York $ 844 $ 686 $ 694 O&R 46 45 49 Competitive energy businesses(a) 58 40 13 Other(b) (23 ) (31 ) (11 ) Total continuing operations 925 740 745 Discontinued operations(c) 4 (3 ) (26 ) Con Edison $ 929 $ 737 $ 719 (a) Includes $(5) million, $(15) million and $(8) million of net after tax mark to market losses in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The following table presents the estimated effect on earnings per share and net income from continuing operations for 2007 as compared with 2006 and 2006 as compared with 2005, resulting from these and other major factors: 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Earningsper Share Net Income(Millions ofDollars) Earningsper Share Net Income(Millions ofDollars) Con Edison of New York Sales growth $ 0.18 $ 46 $ 0.12 $ 28 Impact of weather 0.11 28 (0.32 ) (79 ) Electric rate agreement 0.44 109 0.74 181 Gas rate agreement 0.05 12 0.09 22 Net transfers to firm gas service 0.05 14 Steam rate agreement 0.08 19 0.07 18 Resolution of deferred tax amortization petition 0.06 17 Operations and maintenance expense (0.15 ) (37 ) (0.41 ) (98 ) Depreciation and property taxes (0.28 ) (69 ) (0.27 ) (66 ) Interest charges (0.04 ) (10 ) (0.20 ) (48 ) Other (includes dilutive effect of new stock issuances) (0.08 ) 29 0.08 34 Total Con Edison of New York 0.42 158 (0.10 ) (8 ) Orange and Rockland Utilities (0.01 ) 1 (0.02 ) (4 ) Competitive energy businesses Earnings excluding net mark to market effects 0.01 8 0.12 34 Net mark to market effects 0.04 10 (0.03 ) (7 ) Other, including parent company expenses 0.05 8 (0.05 ) (20 ) Discontinued operations 0.02 7 0.09 23 Total variations $ 0.53 $ 192 $ 0.01 $ 18 See Results of Operations below for further discussion and analysis of results of operations. 31 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Risk Factors The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. These risk factors include: The Utilities Revenues And Results Of Operations Reflect Regulatory Actions The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the prices they can charge their customers. The prices are generally designed to cover the Utilities cost of service (including a return on equity) and generally may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than for the recovery of energy costs and limited other exceptions. The rate plans generally include earnings adjustments for meeting or failing to meet certain standards. Certain of the plans require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. Regulators may also take actions affecting the company outside of the framework of the approved rate plans. The regulators in the states in which the Utilities provide service generally permit the Utilities to recover from their customers the cost of service, other than any cost that is determined to have been imprudently incurred. Regulatory policies are subject to change. The Utilities regulatory filings can involve complex accounting and other calculations. See Application of Critical Accounting Polices and Regulatory Matters, below. Con Edisons Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Is Subject To Regulatory Restrictions Con Edisons ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its businesses. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are generally limited to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See Dividends in Note C to the financial statements. The Companies Purchase Energy For Their Customers A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or in the Companies energy supply arrangements could adversely affect their ability to meet their customers energy needs and the Companies results of operations. The Companies have policies to manage the economic risks related to energy supply, including related hedging transactions and the risk of a counterpartys non performance. The Utilities generally recover their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including the cost of hedging transactions, in accordance with rate provisions approved by state regulators. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses enter into hedging transactions to manage their commodity related price and volumetric risks. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below. Energy Market Prices Are Volatile The impact of changing energy market prices on the Companies is mitigated by their energy management policies and rate provisions pursuant to which the Utilities recover energy supply costs. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below. High energy market prices result in increases in energy costs billed to customers that could result in decreased energy usage. If this were to occur, until the Utilities rates were adjusted to offset the effect of decreased usage, the Utilities would have decreased energy delivery revenues. Prices for electricity, fuel oil and gas could also affect the value of Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. The Utilities Have A Substantial Ongoing Utility Construction Program The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $8 billion over the next three years. The ongoing construction program includes large energy transmission, substation and distribution system projects. The failure to complete these projects in a timely manner could adversely affect the Utilities ability to meet their customers growing energy needs with the high level of reliability that they currently provide. The Utilities expect to use internally generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison and external borrowing to fund the construction expenditures. The Companies Are Active Participants in Financial Markets Changes in financial market conditions or in the Companies credit ratings could adversely affect their ability and their cost to borrow funds. The Companies commercial paper and unsecured debt are rated by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. (Moodys), Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). The interest rates on $636 million of Con Edison of New York tax exempt debt and $99 million of O&R tax exempt debt are also affected by the credit ratings of bond insurers. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources, below. Changes to financial market conditions could also adversely affect the return on investment of the plan assets for the Companies pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits and Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below. The Companies Operate Essential Energy Facilities And Other Systems The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities that are located either in, or close to, public places. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. See Power Outage Proceedings in Note B to the financial statements and 32 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Manhattan Steam Main Rupture in Note H to the financial statements. The Companies have information systems relating to their operations, billing, accounting and other matters, the failure of which could adversely affect the Companies operations and liquidity. In the event of failure or damage to these facilities or systems, the Utilities could incur substantial liability, higher costs and increased regulatory requirements. The Utilities have training, operating, security, maintenance and capital programs designed to provide for the safe and reliable operation of their energy facilities and information systems. Con Edisons Competitive Energy Businesses Are In Evolving Markets Con Edisons competitive energy businesses are active in evolving markets that are affected by the actions of governmental agencies, other organizations (such as independent system operators) and other competitive businesses. Compared to the Utilities, the profitability of their products and services and the recoverability of Con Edisons investment in these competitive energy businesses is not as predictable. The Companies May Be Affected By The Application Of Critical Accounting Policies And Rules The application of the Companies critical accounting policies reflects complex judgments, assumptions and estimates. These policies, which are described in Application of Critical Accounting Policies, below, include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities, the accounting and funding rules applicable to pensions and other postretirement benefits, and accounting for contingencies, long lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases. New accounting policies or rules or changes to current accounting policies, rules or interpretations of such policies or rules that affect the Companies financial statements may be adopted by the relevant accounting or other authorities. The Companies Are Exposed To Risks Relating To Environmental Matters Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See Environmental Matters in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements. Electric and magnetic fields (EMF) are found wherever electricity is used. If a causal relationship between EMF and adverse health effects were established, there could be a material adverse effect on the Companies. Negative perceptions about EMF can make it more difficult to construct facilities needed for the Companies operations. The Companies Are Subject To Extensive Government Regulation And Taxation The Companies operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. The Companies federal income tax returns reflect certain tax positions with which the Internal Revenue Service does not or may not agree, including tax positions with respect to Con Edisons lease in/lease out transactions and the deduction of certain construction related costs for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. See Notes J and L to the financial statements. The Companies may be subject to new laws or regulations or the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies. The Companies Face Risks That Are Beyond Their Control The Companies results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. Economic conditions can affect customers demand and ability to pay for service. The cost of repairing damage to the Companies facilities and the potential disruption of their operations due to heat, storms, natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts, pandemic illnesses and other catastrophic events could be substantial. See Environmental Matters Climate Change in Item 1 and Power Outage Proceedings in Note B to the financial statements. The occurrence or risk of occurrence of future terrorist attacks or related acts of war could also adversely affect the New York or United States economy. A lower level of economic activity for these or other reasons could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could adversely affect the Companies revenues and earnings and limit the Companies future growth prospects. Forward Looking Statements This report includes forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward looking statements are statements of future expectation and not facts. Words such as "expects," "estimates," "anticipates," "intends," "believes," "plans, will" and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are based on information available at the time the statements are made, and accordingly speak only as of that time. Actual results or developments might differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements because of various factors such as those discussed under "Risk Factors," above. 33 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Application of Critical Accounting Policies The Companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies critical accounting policies include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases. Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities The Utilities are subject to SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction. SFAS No. 71 specifies the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under SFAS No. 71. The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in Note B to the financial statements. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission. In the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery (as required by SFAS No. 71), these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December 31, 2007, the regulatory assets for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $4.8 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses also provide such benefits to certain of their employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R), SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. In addition, the Utilities apply SFAS No. 71 to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in Note B to the financial statements, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes E and F to the financial statements for information about the Companies pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2007, 2006 and 2005. The cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks current estimates for 2008 are decreases, compared with 2007, in their pension and other postretirement benefits cost of $2 million and $3 million, respectively. The discount rate used to determine 2008 pension and other postretirement benefit accounting cost is 6.0 percent and the expected return on plan assets (tax exempt assets for postretirement benefit accounting costs) is 8.5 percent. Amortization of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to decrease Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks pension and other postretirement benefit costs by an additional $7 million in 2009. A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2008, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 8.5 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for both Con Edison and Con Edison of New York by approximately $17 million and $16 million, respectively, in 2009. The discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly rated (Aa and Aaa, by Moodys) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments. In determining the health care cost trend rate, the Companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends. The following table illustrates the effect on 2008 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial 34 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED assumptions discussed above, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant: ActuarialAssumption Change inAssumption Pension Other Postretirement Benefits Total (Millions of Dollars) Increase in accounting cost: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 29 $ 4 $ 33 Con Edison of New York (0.25 %) $ 27 $ 3 $ 30 Expected return on plan assets Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 20 $ 2 $ 22 Con Edison of New York (0.25 %) $ 19 $ 2 $ 21 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % $ 3 $ 3 Con Edison of New York 1.00 % $ (1 ) $ (1 ) Increase in projected benefit obligation: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 278 $ 44 $ 322 Con Edison of New York (0.25 %) $ 261 $ 38 $ 299 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % $ 18 $ 18 Con Edison of New York 1.00 % $ (3 ) $ (3 ) Pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which Con Edison of New York, O&R and the competitive energy businesses make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2007 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, Con Edison of New York, O&R and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses made discretionary contributions to the plan in 2007 of $112 million, $36 million and $1 million, respectively, and expect to make discretionary contributions in 2008 of $98 million, $32 million and $1 million, respectively. The Companies policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible and for the Utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate agreements. Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, applies to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include service interruptions experienced in 2006 (Note B), the Utilities responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G); certain tax matters (Notes J and L); and other contingencies (Note H). In accordance with SFAS No. 5, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated. The Utilities generally recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings. Accounting for Long Lived Assets SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under SFAS No. 144, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses test their assets for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying amount might not be recoverable. A critical element of this test is the forecast of future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the long lived assets. Forecast of these cash flows requires complex judgments about future operations, which are particularly difficult to make with respect to evolving industries such as the competitive energy businesses. Under SFAS No. 144, if alternative courses of action are under consideration or if a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows, the probability of all possible outcomes must be weighted. With respect to the forecasted cash flows associated with Con Edison Developments generation facilities, a 10 percent 35 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for these facilities would not result in an impairment charge. As a result of the 2005 tests, Con Edison recognized impairment charges of $9 million ($5 million after tax) with respect to Con Edison Communications. The 2006 tests did not result in an impairment charge. In December 2007, Con Edison Development and its subsidiary, CED/SCS Newington, LLC, agreed to sell their ownership interests in power generating projects with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,706 MW (see Note U to the financial statements). Based on the anticipated sales price of these assets, there was no impairment charge for 2007. See Impairments in Note A to the financial statements. Accounting for Goodwill In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Con Edison is required to annually test goodwill for impairment. See Note K to the financial statements. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill. Goodwill was $408 million at December 31, 2007. The most recent test, which was performed during 2007, did not require any second step assessment and did not result in any impairment. The companys most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values. The company estimated fair values based primarily on discounted cash flows. A decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10 percent would not have resulted in the carrying value of any reporting units exceeding their estimated fair values. Accounting for Derivative Instruments The Companies apply SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, and other related accounting pronouncements to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below and Note O to the financial statements. Where the Companies are required to make mark to market estimates pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources. Accounting for Leases The Companies apply SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and other related pronouncements to their leasing transactions. See Note J to the financial statements for information about Con Edison Developments Lease In/Lease Out or LILO transactions, a disallowance of tax losses by the Internal Revenue Service and a possible future charge to earnings. In accordance with SFAS No. 13, Con Edison accounted for the two LILO transactions as leveraged leases. Accordingly, the companys investment in these leases, net of non recourse debt, is carried as a single amount in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet and income is recognized pursuant to a method that incorporates a level rate of return for those years when net investment in the lease is positive, based upon the after tax cash flows projected at the inception of the leveraged leases. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below. The principal factors affecting Con Edisons liquidity are its investments in the Utilities, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities and cash flows from financing activities, including, in 2007 and 2006, issuance of 14.6 million and 12.2 million shares of common stock for $685 and $510 million, respectively, of which $518 million and $447 million were invested in Con Edison of New York. In 2005, 2.8 million shares of common stock were issued for $78 million. The principal factors affecting Con Edison of New Yorks liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures), the dividends it pays to Con Edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below. The Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short term borrowing to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short 36 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED term borrowings using funds from long term financings and operating activities. The Utilities cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers. Each of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short term and long term cash requirements. See Risk Factors, and Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies, above, and Regulatory Matters, below. Changes in the Companies cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are summarized as follows: Con Edison (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 Variance 2007vs. 2006 2005 Variance 2006vs. 2005 Operating activities $ 1,555 $ 1,354 $ 201 $ 790 $ 564 Investing activities (2,086 ) (1,918 ) (168 ) (1,274 ) (644 ) Financing activities 647 577 70 539 38 Net change 116 13 103 55 (42 ) Balance at beginning of period 94 81 13 26 55 Balance at end of period $ 210 $ 94 $ 116 $ 81 $ 13 Con Edison of New York (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 Variance 2007vs. 2006 2005 Variance 2006vs. 2005 Operating activities $ 1,251 $ 1,163 $ 88 $ 818 $ 345 Investing activities (2,021 ) (1,839 ) (182 ) (1,167 ) (672 ) Financing activities 844 662 182 400 262 Net change 74 (14 ) 88 51 (65 ) Balance at beginning of period 47 61 (14 ) 10 51 Balance at end of period $ 121 $ 47 $ 74 $ 61 $ (14 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities The Utilities cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is dependent primarily on factors external to the Utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy, economic conditions and measures that promote energy efficiency. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate agreements. In general, changes in the Utilities cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate agreements. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements. Net income is the result of cash and non cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies cash flows from operating activities. Principal non cash charges include depreciation and deferred income tax expense. Principal non cash credits include the revenue requirement impact resulting from the reconciliation pursuant to Con Edison of New Yorks electric rate agreement of the differences between the actual amount of transmission and distribution utility plant, net of depreciation to the amounts reflected in electric rates (Net T&D Revenues), prepaid pension costs and amortizations of certain net regulatory liabilities. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, and Notes E and F to the financial statements. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2007 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $201 million and $88 million higher, respectively, than in the 2006 period primarily reflecting increased net income, depreciation expense, deferred income taxes and recovery of certain other receivables, described below, offset in part by higher non cash credits for Net T&D Revenues, rate case amortizations and accruals and higher customer accounts receivable. The change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. This timing issue is reflected within changes to accounts receivable customers, recoverable energy costs and accounts payable balances. The change in other deferred charges and noncurrent assets reflects a $160 million deposit paid by Con Edison to the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the timing of deductions of certain construction related costs. See Note L to the financial statements. Con Edison of New Yorks portion of this deposit, also recorded as a noncurrent asset, was $147 million. 37 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED The increase in other regulatory assets principally reflects increases in deferred pension costs in accordance with SFAS No. 158 and increases in future federal income taxes associated with increased removal costs. See Notes A, B and E to the financial statements. The decrease in other receivables reflects primarily the recovery of a property tax credit associated with Con Edison of New Yorks East River Plant and lower hedging program broker margin deposits (reflecting higher commodity prices). For Con Edison, the decrease also reflects the expiration of certain wholesale load contracts, and receivables associated with other hedging activities at the competitive energy businesses. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2006 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $564 million and $345 million higher, respectively, than in the 2005 period. The increase in net cash flows reflects increased deferred tax benefits, the timing of Con Edison of New Yorks New York City property tax payments and higher energy prices in the last quarter of 2005. The company achieved a 1.5 percent reduction in its City property taxes for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006 by prepaying the annual tax amount due on June 30, 2005 instead of paying semi annual installments on their due dates (July 1, 2005 and January 1, 2006). For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007, the company made a semi annual installment on July 1, 2006. The higher 2005 energy prices resulted in higher accounts receivable, net of allowance for uncollectibles, and accounts payable at the end of 2005 and increased collections of receivables from customers and accounts payable payments in the 2006 period. See Other Changes in Assets and Liabilities, below. Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities in 2007 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $168 million and $182 million higher, respectively, than in 2006. The increases for the Companies reflect primarily increased utility construction expenditures and lower net proceeds from the sale of certain properties ($30 million in 2007, as compared with $60 million in 2006). For Con Edison, the increase also reflects $39 million of net proceeds from the completion of the sale of Con Edison Communications that offset cash flows used in investing activities in 2006. Net cash flows used in investing activities in 2006 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $644 million and $672 million higher, respectively, than in 2005. The increases for the Companies reflect primarily increased utility construction expenditures and decreased net sale proceeds from the sale of certain properties ($60 million in 2006 as compared with $534 million in 2005). The $534 million represents proceeds from the completion of the sale of Con Edison of New York properties located on First Avenue in Manhattan, collectively referred to as the First Avenue Properties, see Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in Note B to the financial statements. For Con Edison, the increase was partially offset, relative to Con Edison of New York, by $39 million of net proceeds from the completion of the sale of Con Edison Communications in March 2006. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York increased $70 million and $182 million in 2007 compared with 2006, and increased $38 million and $262 million, respectively, in 2006 compared with 2005. Con Edisons cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, reflect the issuance through public offerings of 11 million and 9.7 million Con Edison common shares resulting in net proceeds of $558 million and $447 million, respectively. The 2007 proceeds were invested by Con Edison in Con Edison of New York ($518 million) and O&R ($40 million). The $447 million from the 2006 proceeds were invested in Con Edison of New York. Cash flows from financing activities for 2007, 2006 and 2005 also reflect the issuance of Con Edison common shares through its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans (2007: 3.6 million shares for $121 million, 2006: 2.5 million shares for $63 million, 2005: 2.8 million shares for $78 million). In addition, as a result of the stock plan issuances, cash used to pay common stock dividends was reduced by $38 million in 2007 and 2005 and $40 million in 2006. Net cash flows from financing activities during the years ending December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 also reflect the following Con Edison of New York transactions: 2007 Issued $525 million 6.30% 30 year debentures, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes; and Redeemed at maturity $330 million 6.45% 10 year debentures. 2006 Issued $400 million 5.85% 30 year debentures, $250 million 5.30% 10 year debentures and $250 million 5.70% 30 year debentures, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes; Issued $400 million 6.20% 30 year debentures, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes and to redeem in advance of maturity $100 million 7.75% debentures due 2026; and 38 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Issued $400 million 5.50% 10 year debentures, the proceeds of which were used to redeem in advance of maturity $400 million 7.50% debentures due 2041. 2005 Issued $350 million 5.30% 30 year debentures, $125 million 5.25% 30 year debentures and $350 million 5.375% 10 year debentures, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes; Issued note for $126 million of variable rate, tax exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds due 2039, the proceeds of which were classified as restricted cash at June 30, 2005 and used together with other funds to redeem in advance of maturity $128 million 6.10% fixed rate tax exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds due 2020; and Redeemed at maturity $100 million 6.625% 10 year debentures and $350 million 6.625% 5 year debentures. In 2007, Con Edison issued commercial paper and used available cash balances to redeem in advance of maturity $325 million 7.25% 40 year Public Income NotES. Con Edisons net cash flows from financing activities also include O&Rs financings. In 2007, O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary redeemed at maturity $20 million 7.125% First Mortgage Bonds. In 2006, O&R issued $75 million of 5.45% 10 year debentures. In 2005, O&R issued $40 million of 5.30% 10 year debentures. Cash flows from financing activities of the Companies also reflect commercial paper issuance (included on the consolidated balance sheets as Notes payable). The commercial paper amounts outstanding at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 and the average daily balances for 2007, 2006 and 2005 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were as follows: (Millions ofDollars, exceptWeightedAverage Yield) 2007 2006 2005 Out standingat Dec. 31 Dailyaverage Out standingat Dec. 31 Dailyaverage Out standingat Dec. 31 Dailyaverage Con Edison $ 840 $ 160 $ 117 $ 448 $ 755 $ 210 Con Edison of New York $ 555 $ 151 $ $ 305 $ 520 $ 118 Weighted average yield 5.5 % 5.3 % 5.4 % 5.0 % 4.3 % 3.3 % Common stock issuances and external borrowings are sources of liquidity that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital market conditions. For information about the Companies credit ratings and certain financial ratios, see Capital Resources, below. Other Changes in Assets and Liabilities The following table shows changes in assets and liabilities at December 31, 2007, compared with December 31, 2006, that have not impacted the Companies consolidated statements of cash flows. (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison2007 vs. 2006Variance Con Edison ofNew York2007 vs. 2006Variance Assets Fair value of derivative assets $ (86 ) $ 10 Deferred derivative losses (205 ) (180 ) Liabilities Uncertain income taxes 155 142 Fair value of derivative liabilities (322 ) (148 ) For information on the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, see Note L to the financial statements. In the context of higher forward energy market prices and the realization of gains and losses in 2007, the Companies policies for managing their energy purchases resulted in a decrease in the fair value of derivative liabilities at December 31, 2007 as compared with year end 2006. For Con Edison and Con Edison of New York, the decrease in the fair value of derivative liabilities resulted in a decrease in deferred derivative losses at December 31, 2007 as compared with year end 2006. For the Utilities, mark to market activity had no effect on net income as the amounts were deferred as regulatory assets/liabilities (deferred derivative losses/gains). In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers their energy supply costs, net of gains and losses on derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchases. The mark to market accounting for Con Edisons competitive energy businesses resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities. The decline in the fair value of derivative assets reflects increasing capacity prices and the timing of entering into new derivative instruments, which was offset in part by the maturity of certain derivative instruments and the impact of increasing energy prices. The competitive energy businesses record mark to market gains and losses on derivative instruments in earnings in the reporting period in which such changes occur. See Note O to the financial statements. For the Companies, changes in fair value of derivative instruments may lead to collateral payments made to or received from counterparties or brokers that are reflected in other accounts receivable and other current liabilities. Capital Resources Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con Edison expects to finance its capital 39 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED requirements primarily through the sale of securities including the issuance in 2008 of between $225 million and $425 million of Con Edison common shares in addition to issuances under its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans and from dividends it receives from its subsidiaries. Con Edisons ability to make payments on its external borrowings and dividends on its common shares is also dependent on its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its interests in its subsidiaries. Con Edison expects to use the net proceeds from Con Edison Developments and its subsidiarys pending sale of their ownership interests in power generating projects to repay debt and invest the remaining proceeds in its subsidiaries. See Note U to the financial statements. For information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see Note C to the financial statements. For information on the Companies commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see Note D to the financial statements. The Utilities expect to finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally generated funds, contributions of equity capital from Con Edison and external borrowings. The Companies are continuing to monitor developments in the capital markets, and currently believe that the Companies will be able to access capital on reasonable terms. In May 2005, the PSC authorized Con Edison of New York to issue up to $4.4 billion of debt securities prior to December 31, 2009, of which the company had issued $2.2 billion at December 31, 2007. In January 2006, the PSC authorized O&R to issue up to $325 million of debt securities prior to December 31, 2009, of which the company had issued $75 million as of December 31, 2007. In addition, the PSC has authorized the Utilities to refund outstanding debt securities and preferred stock should the Utilities determine that it is economic to do so. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions and borrowings from Con Edison, internally generated funds and external borrowings. See Note P to the financial statements. For each of the Companies, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges (Securities and Exchange Commission basis) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004, and 2003 was: Earnings to Fixed Charges(Times) 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Con Edison 3.4 3.0 3.3 2.8 3.2 Con Edison of New York 3.6 3.2 3.6 3.1 3.4 For each of the Companies, the common equity ratio at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was: Common Equity Ratio (Percent of totalcapitalization) 2007 2006 2005 Con Edison 53.7 48.5 49.0 Con Edison of New York 52.3 50.0 50.7 The commercial paper of the Companies is rated P 1, A 2 and F1, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. Con Edisons unsecured debt is rated A2, A and A, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. The unsecured debt of Con Edison of New York is rated A1, A and A, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. The unsecured debt of O&R is rated A2, A and A, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Con Edison of New York has $636 million of tax exempt debt for which the interest rates are determined pursuant to periodic auctions. Of this amount, $391 million is insured by Ambac Assurance Corporation and $245 million is insured by XL Capital Assurance Inc. Credit rating agencies have recently downgraded the ratings of these insurers from AAA to lower levels. The company believes that the interest rates on its insured tax exempt debt have been adversely impacted by the downgrade. The weighted average annual interest rate on this tax exempt debt was 3.75 percent on February 20, 2008. The weighted average interest rate was 3.77 percent, 3.45 percent and 2.44 percent for the years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. O&R has $99 million of tax exempt debt that currently bears interest at rates determined weekly and is subject to tender by bondholders for purchase by the company. Of this amount, $55 million is insured by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company and $44 million is insured by Ambac Assurance Corporation. Recent downgrades in the credit ratings of these insurers have resulted in interest rates on this O&R debt that are significantly higher than the interest rates borne by Con Edison of New Yorks $225 million of uninsured weekly rate tender bonds. As of February 20, 2008, the weighted average annual interest rate on the O&R insured weekly rate tender bonds, excluding the effects of an interest rate swap agreement (see Interest Rate Hedging in Note B to the financial statements), was 5.61 percent and the rate on the Con Edison of New York weekly rate tender bonds was 2.22 percent. O&R is evaluating alternatives with respect to its tax exempt debt, which could include redemption of the debt and termination of the interest rate swap agreement. 40 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Capital Requirements The following table contains the Companies capital requirements for the years 2005 through 2007 and their current estimate of amounts for 2008 through 2010.

The Utilities have an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to meet the growth in demand for electricity and electric, gas and steam reliability needs. Amounts for 2005 also include expenditures for the East River Repowering Project. The increases in 2006 and 2007 reflect a higher level of expenditures for electric substations and ongoing improvements and reinforcements of the electric distribution system. The Utilities estimated construction expenditures for 2008, 2009, and 2010 are subject to change depending on the outcome of certain regulatory proceedings. See Note B to the financial statements. 41 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Companies material obligations at December 31, 2007, to make payments pursuant to contracts. Long term debt, capital lease obligations and other long term liabilities are included on their balance sheets.

(b) Included in these amounts is the cost of minimum quantities of natural gas supply, transportation and storage that the Utilities are obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. (c) Amounts shown for other purchase obligations, which reflect capital and operations and maintenance costs incurred by the Utilities in running their day to day operations, were derived from the Utilities purchasing systems as the difference between the amounts authorized and the amounts paid (or vouchered to be paid) for each obligation. For many of these obligations, the Utilities are committed to purchase less than the amount authorized. Payments for the Other Purchase Obligations are generally assumed to be made ratably over the term of the obligations. The Utilities believe that unreasonable effort and expense would be involved to modify their purchasing systems to enable them to report their Other Purchase Obligations in a different manner. (d) Amounts represent commitments to purchase minimum quantities of electric energy and capacity, natural gas, natural gas pipeline capacity and generating plant services entered into by Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. These obligations do not include any obligations related to the generation projects being sold. See Note U to the financial statements. 42 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED The Companies commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments include their other liabilities reflected in their balance sheets, any funding obligations for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans, financial hedging activities, their collective bargaining agreements and Con Edisons guarantees of certain obligations of its businesses. See Notes E, F, O and Guarantees in Note H to the financial statements. Electric Power Requirements In 2007, the Utilities purchased substantially all of the energy they sold to customers pursuant to firm contracts and through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market. Con Edison expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2008. In general, the Utilities recover prudently incurred purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See "Financial and Commodity Market Risks Commodity Price Risk," below and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. From time to time certain parties have petitioned the PSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity. To reduce the volatility of electric energy costs, the Utilities have firm contracts to purchase electric energy and enter into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of their expected purchases under these contracts and through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market, which together cover a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to customers in 2008. See Notes I and O to the financial statements. O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary entered into firm contracts to purchase electric energy for substantially all of the electric energy expected to be sold to its customers in 2008. Con Edison of New York also owns generating stations in New York City associated primarily with its steam system. As of December 31, 2007, the generating stations had a combined electric capacity of approximately 704 MW, based on 2007 summer ratings. O&R does not own any electric generating capacity. In a July 1998 order, the PSC indicated that it "agree(s) generally that Con Edison of New York need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops," but considers "overly broad" and did not adopt Con Edison of New Yorks request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, it will no longer be required to engage in long range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of capacity. Con Edison of New York monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO. In December 2007, the PSC initiated a proceeding to consider a form of integrated resource planning, which could involve the imposition of obligations on transmission owners (such as Con Edison of New York), that may be needed for system reliability if the market does not solve a reliability need identified by the NYISO. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses sell electricity to wholesale and retail customers in the NYISO, PJM Interconnection (PJM), ISO New England (ISO NE) and other markets. In addition, at December 31, 2007, Con Edison Development owned equity interests in electric generating facilities equivalent to 1,739 MW of net generating capacity, substantially all of which is located within the PJM or the ISO NE. Con Edison Energy sells the electricity from these generating facilities on the wholesale electricity markets or under contract. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks Commodity Price Risk, below. In December 2007, Con Edison Development and its subsidiary, CED/SCS Newington, LLC, agreed to sell their ownership interests in these power generating projects with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,706 MW. See Note U to the financial statements. 43 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Regulatory Matters The following table, which summarizes certain significant provisions of the Utilities principal rate agreements, should be read in conjunction with, and is subject to, the more detailed discussion of the agreements in Note B to the financial statements.

In May 2007, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC for an electric rate increase of $1,225 million effective April 1, 2008. The PSC is expected to rule on the companys request in March 2008. O&R has pending a request with the PSC for an increase in the rates it charges for electric service rendered in New York, effective July 2008, of $43.7 million. See Note B to the financial statements. The Companies are actively participating in regulatory proceedings at the federal level that are underway to implement the Energy Policy Act of 2005, such as the implementation of mandatory reliability standards through the North American Electric Reliability Council and efforts to increase investment in infrastructure, including implementation of transmission pricing incentives. The Companies also participate in other federal regulatory proceedings that affect electric capacity and energy markets in New York and PJM regions, and those that affect gas pipeline companies. 44 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Financial and Commodity Market Risks The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk. Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. The Companies estimate that at December 31, 2007, each 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks variable rate debt and commercial paper would result in a change in annual interest expense of $7 million and $5 million, respectively. In addition, from time to time, Con Edison and its businesses enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See Interest Rate Hedging in Note O to the financial statements. Commodity Price Risk Con Edisons commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note O to the financial statements. Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2007, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $99 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $64 million is for Con Edison of New York and $35 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses use a value at risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of instruments or the portfolio due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. These businesses estimate VaR across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for transactions associated with hedges on generating assets and commodity contracts, assuming a one day holding period, for the years ended December 31, 2007, and 2006, respectively, was as follows: 95% Confidence Level, One Day Holding Period 2007 2006 (Millions of Dollars) Average for the period $ 3 $ 3 High 7 10 Low 1 1 Credit Risk The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. Credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterpartys nonperformance. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, netting provisions within agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements, credit insurance and credit default swaps. The Companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff. The Utilities had $66 million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral and reserves, at December 31, 2007, of which $28 million was with investment grade counterparties and $38 million was with commodity exchange brokers. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses had $92 million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral and reserves, at December 31, 2007, of which $71 million was with investment grade counterparties and $21 million was with commodity exchanges or independent system operators. 45 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Investment Risk The Companies investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, above. The Companies current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 65 percent equities and 35 percent fixed income and other securities. At December 31, 2007, the pension plan investments consisted of 65 percent equity and 35 percent fixed income and other securities. See Notes E and F to the financial statements. Environmental Matters For information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos, see Environmental Matters in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements. Impact of Inflation The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies long term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. Also, to the extent the Companies prices change by more or less than inflation, the real price of the Companies services will increase or decline. Over the past 20 years, for example, the real price of electric service has declined substantially. Material Contingencies For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies material contingencies, see Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies, and Notes B, G, H, J and L to the financial statements. Results of Operations Results of operations reflect, among other things, the Companies accounting policies (see Application of Critical Accounting Policies, above), rate plans that cover the rates the Utilities can charge their customers (see Regulatory Matters, above) and demand for utility service. Demand for utility service is affected by weather, economic conditions and other factors. The Companies results of operations for the 12 months ended December 31, 2007 reflect sales growth, the Utilities rate plans (which are designed to recover increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes, and interest charges), the impact of storms and weather in 2007. For additional information about major factors affecting earnings, see Results of Operations Summary, above. In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel, gas purchased for resale and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full service customers (see Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A and Regulatory Matters in Note B to the financial statements). Accordingly, such costs do not generally affect the Companies results of operations. Management uses the term net revenues (operating revenues less such costs) to identify changes in operating revenues that may affect the Companies results of operations. Management believes that, although net revenues may not be a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the measure facilitates the analysis by management and investors of the Companies results of operations. Con Edisons principal business segments are Con Edison of New Yorks regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities, O&Rs regulated electric and gas utility activities and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. Con Edison of New Yorks principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities. A discussion of the results of operations by principal business segment for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 follows. For additional business segment financial information, see Note N to the financial statements. 46 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2006 The Companies results of operations (which were discussed above under Results of Operations Summary) in 2007 compared with 2006 were: Con Edison* Con Edison of New York O&R Competitive EnergyBusinesses and Other** (Millions of Dollars) Increases(Decreases)Amount Increases(Decreases)Percent Increases(Decreases)Amount Increases(Decreases)Percent Increases(Decreases)Amount Increases(Decreases)Percent Increases(Decreases)Amount Increases(Decreases)Percent Operating revenues $ 1,158 9.7 % $ 597 6.4 % $ 118 14.4 % $ 443 23.9 % Purchased power 452 9.1 (38 ) (1.2 ) 77 25.1 413 25.5 Fuel 71 12.8 63 12.0 N/A N/A 8 28.6 Gas purchased for resale 91 8.4 76 8.4 16 10.7 (1 ) (3.3 ) Operating revenues less purchased power, fuel and gas purchased for resale (net revenues) 544 10.2 496 10.3 25 6.9 23 12.7 Other operations and maintenance 201 10.7 164 10.1 18 9.7 19 24.4 Depreciation and amortization 50 8.4 48 8.8 3 8.6 (1 ) (6.7 ) Taxes, other than income taxes 74 5.9 80 6.8 (5 ) (10.6 ) (1 ) (5.3 ) Income taxes 45 11.1 37 10.4 (1 ) (4.0 ) 9 33.3 Operating income 174 14.3 167 15.0 10 14.5 (3 ) (7.1 ) Other income less deductions and related federal income tax 18 62.1 3 9.1 (3 ) (75.0 ) 18 Large Net interest expense 7 1.4 12 2.7 6 21.4 (11 ) (30.6 ) Income from continuing operations 185 25.0 158 23.0 1 2.2 26 Large Discontinued operations *** 7 Large N/A N/A N/A N/A 7 Large Net income $ 192 26.1 % $ 158 23.0 % $ 1 2.2 % $ 33 Large * Represents the consolidated financial results of Con Edison and its businesses. ** Includes inter company and parent company accounting. *** See Note U to the financial statements. 47 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Con Edison of New York Electric Con Edison of New Yorks electric sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2007 compared with 2006 were: Millions of kWhs Delivered Revenues in Millions Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Description December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Variation PercentVariation December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Variation PercentVariation Residential/Religious 12,312 12,590 (278 ) (2.2 )% $ 2,657 $ 2,631 $ 26 1.0 % Commercial/Industrial 12,918 13,409 (491 ) (3.7 ) 2,486 2,460 26 1.1 Retail access customers 21,532 19,256 2,276 11.8 1,334 1,040 294 28.3 NYPA, Municipal Agency and other sales 11,499 11,053 446 4.0 342 310 32 10.3 Other operating revenues 621 611 10 1.6 Total 58,261 56,308 1,953 3.5 % $ 7,440 $ 7,052 $ 388 5.5 % Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating revenues increased $388 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due primarily to the third year of the electric rate plan ($201 million, which includes $71 million of Net T&D Revenues), increased recoveries of demand side management programs ($84 million), sales growth ($50 million), the recognition of the gain on the sale of properties ($29 million), the impact of the weather in 2007 ($12 million), higher transmission revenues ($10 million) and increased recoverable fuel costs ($10 million), offset in part by a decrease in recoverable purchased power costs ($25 million). Other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the companys rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements. Electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area increased 3.5 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 due primarily to sales growth. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area increased 2.6 percent in 2007 compared with 2006. Con Edison of New Yorks electric fuel costs increased $10 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due primarily to higher sendout volumes from the companys generating facilities ($12 million), offset by a decrease in unit costs ($2 million). Electric purchased power costs decreased $25 million in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting a decrease in purchased volumes associated with milder 2007 weather and additional customers obtaining their energy supply through competitive providers ($75 million), offset by an increase in unit costs ($50 million). Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating income increased $131 million in 2007 compared with 2006. The increase reflects primarily higher net revenues ($403 million due principally to provisions of the electric rate agreement and sales growth), offset in part by higher operations and maintenance costs ($143 million, due primarily to the impact of storms, demand side management program expenses and increased transmission and distribution expenses), taxes other than income taxes ($59 million principally property taxes), income taxes ($35 million) and depreciation ($34 million). 48 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Gas Con Edison of New Yorks gas sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2007 compared with 2006 were: Thousands of dths Delivered Revenues in Millions Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Description December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Variation PercentVariation December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Variation PercentVariation Residential 42,573 40,589 1,984 4.9 % $ 842 $ 781 $ 61 7.8 % General 31,162 31,269 (107 ) (0.3 ) 499 471 28 5.9 Firm transportation 39,016 23,688 15,328 64.7 168 105 63 60.0 Total firm sales and transportation 112,751 95,546 17,205 18.0 1,509 1,357 152 11.2 Interruptible sales 10,577 11,995 (1,418 ) (11.8 ) 88 121 (33 ) (27.3 ) NYPA 42,085 41,057 1,028 2.5 4 4 Generation plants 79,942 64,365 15,577 24.2 52 46 6 13.0 Other 15,318 19,324 (4,006 ) (20.7 ) 24 30 (6 ) (20.0 ) Other operating revenues 82 55 27 49.1 Total 260,673 232,287 28,386 12.2 % $ 1,759 $ 1,613 $ 146 9.1 % Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating revenues increased $146 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due primarily to an increase in recoverable purchased gas costs ($76 million), the gas rate plans ($32 million), the movement of certain customers from interruptible to firm service ($23 million) and sales growth ($9 million). Con Edison of New Yorks revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. Other gas operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the companys rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements. Con Edison of New Yorks sales and transportation volumes for firm customers increased 18.0 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting primarily the impact of the colder winter weather in 2007 compared with 2006 and the net transfers to firm service. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days and net transfers to firm service, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the companys service area increased 2.3 percent in 2007. Con Edison of New Yorks purchased gas cost increased $76 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due to higher sendout volumes ($120 million), offset by lower unit costs ($44 million). Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating income increased $32 million in 2007 compared with 2006. The increase reflects primarily higher net revenues ($70 million), offset by higher income taxes ($13 million), taxes other than income taxes ($12 million, principally property taxes), operations and maintenance expense ($9 million) and depreciation ($4 million).

Other steam operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the companys rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements. Steam sales and delivery volumes increased 11.0 percent in 2007 compared with 2006, reflecting primarily the impact of weather. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, steam sales and deliveries increased 0.2 percent in 2007. Con Edison of New Yorks steam fuel costs increased $53 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due primarily to higher sendout volumes ($32 million) and higher unit costs ($21 million). Steam purchased power costs decreased $13 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due primarily to lower unit costs ($11 million) and purchased volumes ($2 million). Steam operating income increased $4 million in 2007 compared with 2006. The increase reflects primarily higher net revenues ($23 million) and lower income taxes ($11 million), offset in part by higher operations and maintenance expense ($12 million), depreciation ($10 million) and taxes other than income taxes ($9 million, principally property taxes). Taxes Other Than Income Taxes At over $1 billion, taxes other than income taxes remain one of Con Edison of New Yorks largest operating expenses.

Sales and transportation volumes for firm customers increased 12.7 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting the impact of the weather in 2007. After adjusting for weather and other variations, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 0.3 percent higher in 2007 compared with 2006. O&Rs revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. Non firm transportation of customer owned gas to electric generating plants increased in 2007 compared with 2006 because certain facilities resumed burning gas to generate electricity. The increase in gas burned had minimal impact on earnings because most revenues from these customers result from a fixed demand charge for local transportation. Gas operating income increased by $6 million in 2007 compared with 2006. The increase reflects higher net revenues ($13 million) and lower taxes other than income taxes ($1 million, principally property taxes), offset in part by higher operations and maintenance costs ($7 million), income taxes ($1 million) and depreciation ($1 million). Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes, other than income taxes, decreased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006. The principal components of taxes, other than income taxes, were: (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 25 $ 30 $(5) State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 13 13 Payroll taxes 4 4 Total $ 42 (a) $ 47 (a) $(5) (a) Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes, billed to customers in 2007 and 2006 were $71 million and $73 million, respectively. 51 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Income Taxes Operating income taxes decreased by $1 million in 2007 compared with 2006. Other Income (Deductions) Other income (deductions) decreased $3 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due primarily to the sale of non utility property and higher interest income in 2006. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense increased $6 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due primarily to a new debt issuance in late 2006 and interest accrued for the potential repayment of tax benefits from the timing of tax deductions of certain construction related costs (see Note L to the financial statements). Competitive Energy Businesses The competitive energy businesses operating income and earnings from continuing operations increased $2 million and $18 million, respectively, in 2007 compared with 2006 due primarily to higher gross margins from generating plants and wholesale sales, higher income from investments and lower mark to market losses, offset in part by lower gross margins from electric retail sales. Operating revenues increased $384 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily due to higher electric wholesale and retail revenues. Electric wholesale revenues increased $134 million, of which $150 million was due to higher sales volume, offset by a $16 million decrease in unit prices. Electric retail revenues increased $190 million in 2007 as compared with 2006, of which $173 million was due to higher sales volumes and $17 million was due to an increase in unit prices. While electric retail revenues increased more than 16 percent from 2006 to 2007, gross margins decreased by approximately 20 percent due primarily to lower margins on indexed priced products. Revenue from the sale of electricity from the competitive energy businesses generation facilities increased $26 million in 2007 as compared with 2006 due primarily to higher capacity prices. Net mark to market losses decreased $17 million in 2007 as compared with 2006 due primarily to higher prices on electric and natural gas contracts, which were economic hedges that supported retail obligations (but were not accounted for as cash flow hedges). Other revenues increased $17 million in 2007 as compared with 2006 due primarily to energy services revenue. Operating expenses excluding income taxes increased $373 million in 2007 compared with 2006, reflecting increased purchased power ($348 million), other operations and maintenance costs ($19 million) and fuel costs ($8 million) offset in part by lower gas purchased for resale costs ($2 million). Other income increased $12 million in 2007 as compared with 2006 due primarily to a $6 million gain from the sale of an equity investment. Income taxes increased $10 million in 2007 as compared with 2006, reflecting primarily higher income. Discontinued Operations Net income from discontinued operations was $4 million in 2007 compared with a $3 million loss in 2006, reflecting lower mark to market losses in 2007 from certain Con Edison Development generation projects. See Note U to the financial statements. Other For Con Edison, Other in 2006 reflects a $9 million expense (which will not be recoverable under the Utilities rate plans) for a charitable commitment to the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation and a $9 million expense to effectively reclassify from retained earnings to additional paid in capital the tax benefits from the exercise of stock options that had been recognized in income in prior years. For Con Edison, Other also includes inter company eliminations relating to operating revenues and operating expenses. 52 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2005 The Companies results of operations (which were discussed above under Results of Operations Summary) in 2006 compared with 2005 were: Con Edison* Con Edison of New York O&R Competitive EnergyBusinesses and Other** (Millions of Dollars) Increases(Decreases)Amount Increases(Decreases)Percent Increases(Decreases)Amount Increases(Decreases)Percent Increases(Decreases)Amount Increases(Decreases)Percent Increases(Decreases)Amount Increases(Decreases)Percent Operating revenues $ 619 5.5 % $ 61 0.7 % $ (6 ) (0.7 )% $ 564 43.7 % Purchased power 276 5.9 (270 ) (8.1 ) (14 ) (4.4 ) 560 52.9 Fuel (43 ) (7.2 ) (1 ) (0.2 ) (42 ) (60.0 ) Gas purchased for resale (73 ) (6.3 ) (63 ) (6.5 ) 7 4.9 (17 ) (36.2 ) Operating revenues less purchased power, fuel and gas purchased for resale (net revenues) 459 9.4 395 8.9 1 0.3 63 53.8 Other operations and maintenance 218 13.1 195 13.7 8 4.5 15 23.8 Depreciation and amortization 37 6.6 36 7.1 1 2.9 Taxes, other than income taxes 69 5.8 69 6.2 Income taxes 40 10.9 26 7.9 (6 ) (19.4 ) 20 Large Operating income 95 8.4 69 6.6 (2 ) (2.8 ) 28 Large Other income less deductions and related federal income tax (12 ) (29.3 ) 5 17.9 3 Large (20 ) (90.9 ) Net interest expense 88 20.9 82 22.5 4 16.7 2 5.9 Income from continuing operations (5 ) (0.7 ) (8 ) (1.2 ) (3 ) (6.1 ) 6 Large Discontinued operations *** 23 88.5 N/A N/A N/A N/A 23 88.5 Net income $ 18 2.5 % $ (8 ) (1.2 )% $ (3 ) (6.1 )% $ 29 Large * Represents the consolidated financial results of Con Edison and its businesses. ** Includes inter company and parent company accounting. *** See Notes T and U to the financial statements. 53 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Con Edison of New York Electric Con Edison of New Yorks electric sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2006 compared with 2005 were: Millions of kWhs Delivered Revenues in Millions Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Description December 31,2006 December 31,2005 Variation PercentVariation December 31,2006 December 31,2005 Variation PercentVariation Residential/Religious 12,590 13,690 (1,100 ) (8.0 )% $ 2,631 $ 2,884 $ (253 ) (8.8 )% Commercial/Industrial 13,409 15,402 (1,993 ) (12.9 ) 2,460 2,869 (409 ) (14.3 ) Retail access customers 19,256 16,848 2,408 14.3 1,040 679 361 53.2 NYPA, Municipal Agency and other sales 11,053 11,430 (377 ) (3.3 ) 310 337 (27 ) (8.0 ) Other operating revenues 611 179 432 Large Total 56,308 57,370 (1,062 ) (1.9 )% $ 7,052 $ 6,948 $ 104 1.5 % Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating revenues were $104 million higher in 2006 than in 2005 due primarily to increased recoverable fuel costs ($52 million), sales growth ($38 million), increased collections for demand side management programs ($31 million), the electric rate plan that took effect in April 2005 ($213 million), recovery of costs relating to the East River Repowering Project ($19 million), a reversal of a portion of the provision for refund to customers of shared earnings above the target level accrued in 2005 ($70 million) and a 2005 provision for refund to customers of deferred taxes associated with the sale of the First Avenue Properties ($23 million), offset in part by a decrease in purchased power costs ($286 million) and the impact of the milder weather ($91 million). Other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the companys rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements. Electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area decreased 1.8 percent in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily reflecting milder weather in 2006 compared with 2005. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area increased 1.8 percent in 2006 compared with 2005. Con Edison of New Yorks electric fuel costs increased $52 million, reflecting higher sendout volumes from the companys generating facilities ($59 million), offset by a decrease in unit costs ($7 million). Electric purchased power costs decreased $286 million in 2006 compared with 2005 reflecting a decrease in purchased volumes associated with milder 2006 weather and additional customers obtaining their energy supply through competitive providers ($547 million), partially offset by an increase in unit costs ($261 million). Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating income increased $54 million in 2006 compared with 2005. The increase reflects higher net revenues ($340 million due principally to the electric rate agreement), offset in part by higher operations and maintenance costs ($175 million due primarily to power outages ($63 million), compensation for spoilage of food associated with certain of the outages ($9 million), demand side management program expenses ($31 million), East River Repowering Project costs ($19 million), higher expenses relating to uncollectible customer accounts ($7 million), increased transmission and distribution expenses ($19 million) and recognition of expense for stock based compensation ($7 million)), taxes other than income taxes ($60 million, principally property taxes) and depreciation ($21 million). 54 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Gas Con Edison of New Yorks gas sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2006 compared with 2005 were: Thousands of dths Delivered Revenues in Millions Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Description December 31,2006 December 31,2005 Variation PercentVariation December 31,2006 December 31,2005 Variation PercentVariation Residential 40,589 48,175 (7,586 ) (15.7 )% $ 781 $ 816 $ (35 ) (4.3 )% General 31,269 36,800 (5,531 ) (15.0 ) 471 493 (22 ) (4.5 ) Firm transportation 23,688 19,088 4,600 24.1 105 69 36 52.2 Total firm sales and transportation 95,546 104,063 (8,517 ) (8.2 ) 1,357 1,378 (21 ) (1.5 ) Interruptible sales 11,995 13,128 (1,133 ) (8.6 ) 121 149 (28 ) (18.8 ) NYPA 41,057 22,305 18,752 84.1 4 4 Generation plants 64,365 48,564 15,801 32.5 46 50 (4 ) (8.0 ) Other 19,324 18,103 1,221 6.7 30 25 5 20.0 Other operating revenues 55 24 31 Large Total 232,287 206,163 26,124 12.7 % $ 1,613 $ 1,630 $ (17 ) (1.0 )% Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating revenues in 2006 decreased $17 million compared with 2005, reflecting primarily a decrease in purchased gas costs ($63 million), offset in part by higher non firm revenues ($7 million) and the gas rate plan ($30 million). Con Edison of New Yorks revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. Other gas operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the companys rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements. Con Edison of New Yorks sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 8.2 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 reflecting primarily the impact of the milder winter and spring weather in 2006.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes At over $1 billion, taxes other than income taxes remain one of Con Edison of New Yorks largest operating expenses. The principal components of, and variations in, taxes other than income taxes were: (Millions of Dollars) 2006 2005 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 869 $ 796 $ 73 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 253 267 (14 ) Payroll taxes 54 52 2 Other taxes 7 (1 ) 8 Total $ 1,183 (a) $ 1,114 (a) $ 69 (a) Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customers in both 2006 and 2005 were $1.5 billion. Income Taxes Operating income taxes increased $26 million in 2006 compared with 2005 due principally to higher income in the 2006 period. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense increased $82 million in 2006 compared with 2005 due principally to $28 million of interest accrued for the potential repayment of tax benefits from the timing of tax deductions of certain construction related costs (see Note L to the financial statements), new debt issuances since December 31, 2005, higher interest rates on variable rate debt and higher interest rates on and principal amounts of commercial paper.

O&Rs purchased power costs decreased $14 million in 2006 compared with 2005 due to a decrease in purchased volumes associated with milder 2006 weather. Other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the companys electric rate plan. See Note B to the financial statements. Electric delivery volumes in O&Rs service area decreased 5.8 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily as a result of the milder weather in 2006. After adjusting for weather variations and unbilled revenues, electric delivery volumes in O&Rs service area increased 0.1 percent in 2006 compared with 2005.

The increase is due primarily to higher costs of gas purchased for resale in 2006. Sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 12.6 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 reflecting the impact of the milder winter and spring weather in 2006. After adjusting for weather and other variations, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 2.8 percent lower in 2006 compared with 2005 partially due to reduced customer usage. O&Rs revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. Non firm transportation of customer owned gas to electric generating plants increased in 2006 compared with 2005 because certain facilities resumed burning gas to generate electricity. The increase in gas burned had minimal impact on earnings because most revenues from these customers result from a fixed demand charge for local transportation. Gas operating income decreased by $1 million in 2006 compared with 2005. 57 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes, other than income taxes, were the same in 2006 compared with 2005.

Income Taxes Operating income taxes decreased by $6 million in 2006 compared with 2005 due principally to lower income in the 2006 period. Other Income (Deductions) Other income (deductions) increased $3 million in 2006 compared with 2005 due primarily to the sale of non utility property and increased interest income. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense increased $4 million in 2006 compared with 2005 due principally to higher interest rates on and principal amounts of commercial paper and new debt issuances in the 2006 period. Competitive Energy Businesses The competitive energy businesses operating income and earnings from continuing operations increased $28 million and $27 million, respectively, in 2006 compared with 2005 due primarily to higher operating revenues and gross margins on wholesale and retail electric sales, offset in part by higher mark to market losses. Operating revenues increased $629 million in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily due to higher electric wholesale and retail revenues offset in part by decreased generation and other revenues and increased net mark to market losses. Electric wholesale revenues increased $602 million, of which $564 million was due to higher sales volume and $38 million was due to an increase in unit prices. Electric retail revenues increased $124 million in 2006 as compared with 2005, of which $71 million was due to higher sales volumes and $53 million was due to an increase in unit prices. While electric retail revenues increased more than 12 percent from 2005 to 2006, gross margins increased at a greater rate as more customers shifted from indexed contracts to fixed price contracts as energy prices declined during the year. Renewal rates for customers have remained above 90 percent for the past two years. Revenue from the sale of electricity from the competitive energy businesses generation facilities was $49 million lower, reflecting lower unit prices and volumes, partially offset by reliability related capacity payments for two of its Massachusetts generating facilities. The development of capacity markets in New England and PJM is expected to result in more predictable capacity revenues. Net mark to market losses increased $12 million in 2006 as compared with 2005 due primarily to lower prices on natural gas contracts, which were economic hedges that supported retail obligations (but did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting). Other revenue, primarily wholesale revenue and intercompany revenue, decreased $36 million. Operating expenses excluding income taxes increased $583 million in 2006 compared with 2005, reflecting increased purchased power ($624 million) and other operations and maintenance costs ($19 million), offset in part by lower fuel costs ($42 million), gas purchased for resale costs ($17 million) and taxes other than income taxes ($1 million). Income taxes increased $19 million in 2006 as compared with 2005, reflecting primarily higher income. Other income (deductions) decreased $1 million in 2006 compared with 2005 due primarily to an impairment of $6 million on an equity investment (see Impairments in Note A to the financial statements), offset in part by higher interest income. Discontinued Operations Losses from discontinued operations were $23 million lower in 2006 as compared with 2005 due primarily to losses from Con Edison Communications in 2005 ($13 million) and higher margins from certain Con Edison Development generation projects in 2006 ($10 million). See Notes T and U to the financial statements. Other For Con Edison, Other in 2006 reflects a $9 million expense (which will not be recoverable under the Utilities rate plans) for a charitable commitment to the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation and a $9 million expense to effectively reclassify from retained earnings to additional paid in capital the tax benefits from the exercise of stock options that had been recognized in income in prior years. For Con Edison, Other also includes inter company eliminations relating to operating revenues and operating expenses. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.
