ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) This combined managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) relates to the consolidated financial statements included in this report of two separate registrants: Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) and Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York) and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto. As used in this report, the term the Companies refers to Con Edison and Con Edison of New York. Con Edison of New York is a subsidiary of Con Edison and, as such, information in this MD&A about Con Edison of New York applies to Con Edison. Information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements referred to in this discussion and analysis is incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as see or refer to shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made. Corporate Overview Con Edisons principal business operations are those of its utility companies, Con Edison of New York and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R), together known as the Utilities. Con Edison also has competitive energy businesses (see Competitive Energy Businesses, below). Certain financial data of Con Edisons businesses is presented below: Twelve months endedDecember 31, 2008 AtDecember 31,2008 (Millions of Dollars) OperatingRevenues Net Income Assets Con Edison of New York $ 10,424 77 % $ 783 65 % $ 30,415 91 % O&R 991 7 % 44 4 % 2,157 6 % Total Utilities 11,415 84 % 827 69 % 32,572 97 % Con Edison Development (a) 48 % 146 12 % 407 1 % Con Edison Energy (a) 878 7 % (17 ) (1 )% 223 1 % Con Edison Solutions (a) 1,258 9 % (56 ) (5 )% 38 % Other (b) (16 ) % 22 2 % 258 1 % Total continuing operations 13,583 100 % 922 77 % 33,498 100 % Discontinued operations (c) % 274 23 % % Total Con Edison $ 13,583 100 % $ 1,196 100 % $ 33,498 100 % (a) Income from continuing operations of the competitive energy businesses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 includes $(59) million of net after tax mark to market gains/(losses) (Con Edison Development, $17 million, Con Edison Energy, $(26) million and Con Edison Solutions, $(50) million). Con Edison Developments income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 also includes $131 million of after tax gain from the sale of generation projects. See Note V to the financial statements. (b) Represents inter company and parent company accounting. See Results of Operations, below. The twelve months ended December 31, 2008 includes $30 million of after tax net income related to the resolution of the Companys legal proceeding with Northeast Utilities. (c) Represents the discontinued operations of Con Edison Developments generation projects, which includes a $270 million after tax gain on the sale of generation projects for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. See Note V to the financial statements. Con Edisons net income for common stock in 2008 was $1,196 million or $4.38 a share. Net income for common stock in 2007 and 2006 was $929 million or $3.49 a share and $737 million or $2.96 a share, respectively. See Results of Operations Summary, below. Con Edisons principal business segments are Con Edison of New Yorks regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities, O&Rs regulated electric and gas utility activities and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. Con Edison of New Yorks principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities. For segment financial information, see Note N to the financial statements and Results of Operations, below. For information about factors that could have a material adverse effect on the Companies, see Risk Factors, below. Regulated Utilities Con Edison of New York provides electric service to approximately 3.3 million customers and gas service to approximately 1.1 million customers in New York City and Westchester County. The company also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. O&R, along with its regulated utility businesses, provides electric service to approximately 0.3 million customers in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of northern New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania and gas service to over 0.1 million customers in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of eastern Pennsylvania. The Utilities are primarily wires and pipes energy delivery businesses that deliver energy in their service areas subject to extensive federal and state regulation. The Utilities customers buy this energy from the Utilities, or from other suppliers through the Utilities retail access programs. The Utilities purchase substantially all of the energy they sell to customers pursuant to firm contracts or through wholesale energy markets, and recover (generally on a current basis) the cost of the energy sold, pursuant to approved rate plans. Con Edison anticipates that the Utilities will continue to provide substantially all of its earnings over the next few years. The Utilities earnings will depend on various factors including demand for utility service and the Utilities ability to charge rates for their services that reflect the costs of service, including a return on invested equity capital. 26 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Because the energy delivery infrastructure must be adequate to meet demand in peak periods with a high level of reliability, the Utilities capital investment plans reflect in great part past actual electric peak demand adjusted to summer design weather conditions, as well as forecast growth in peak usage. The factors affecting demand for utility service include growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy, economic conditions and measures that promote energy efficiency. Demand for electric service peaks during the summer air conditioning season. Demand for gas and steam service peaks during the winter heating season. The weather during the summer of 2008 was cooler than design conditions. The highest peak electric demand reached in 2008 was 12,987 MW for Con Edison of New York and 1,530 MW for O&R. Both peaks occurred on June 10, 2008. The Companies have continued to monitor the effects of the ongoing global financial turmoil on the local economy and have reduced their outlook for customer demand. The Utilities currently estimate that, under design weather conditions, the 2009 peak electric demand in their respective service areas will be 13,750 MW for Con Edison of New York and 1,650 MW for O&R. The average annual growth rate of the peak electric demand over the next five years at design conditions is estimated to be approximately 0.6 percent for Con Edison of New York and 2.1 percent for O&R. The Con Edison of New York forecasted peak demand includes the impact of permanent demand reduction programs. The Companies anticipate an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to meet this growth in peak usage with the high level of reliability that they currently provide (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Requirements, below). The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the rates they can charge their customers. Con Edison of New Yorks electric, gas and steam rate plans are effective through March 31, 2009, September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2010, respectively. In May 2008, Con Edison of New York filed a request for a new electric rate plan. O&Rs rate plans for its electric and gas service in New York and its subsidiarys electric service in New Jersey extend through June 30, 2011, October 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010, respectively. Pursuant to the Utilities multi year rate plans, charges to customers generally may not be changed during the respective terms of the rate plans other than for recovery of the costs incurred for energy supply, for specified increases provided in the rate plans and for limited other exceptions. The New York rate plans for Con Edison of New Yorks gas and steam operations as well as O&Rs electric and gas operations generally require the Utilities to share with customers earnings in excess of specified rates of return on common equity capital. Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in Con Edison of New Yorks current electric and gas rate plans and O&Rs electric rate plan, the Utilities revenues will generally not be affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. See Regulatory Matters below and Recoverable Energy Costs and Rate Agreements in Notes A and B, respectively, to the financial statements. Accounting rules and regulations for public utilities include Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, pursuant to which the economic effects of rate regulation are reflected in financial statements. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies, below. Competitive Energy Businesses Con Edisons competitive energy businesses participate in segments of the electricity industry that are less comprehensively regulated than the Utilities. These segments include the sales and related hedging of electricity to wholesale and retail customers and sales of certain energy related products and services. At December 31, 2008, Con Edisons equity investment in its competitive energy businesses was $229 million and their assets amounted to $668 million. Con Edison is evaluating additional opportunities to invest in electric and gas related businesses. Consolidated Edison Solutions, Inc. (Con Edison Solutions) sells electricity directly to delivery service customers of utilities primarily in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic regions (including some of the Utilities customers) and also offers energy related services. Con Edison Solutions does not sell electricity to the Utilities. The company sold approximately 11 million MWHs of electricity to customers in 2008. Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. (Con Edison Development) participates in infrastructure projects. In 2008, Con Edison Development and its subsidiary, CED/SCS Newington, LLC, completed the sale of their ownership interests in power generating projects with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,706 MW. See Note V to the financial statements. Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc. (Con Edison Energy) procures electric energy and capacity for Con Edison Solutions and fuel for other companies. It sells the electric capacity and energy produced by plants owned, leased or operated by others. The company also provides energy risk management services to Con Edison Solutions, offers these services to others and enters into wholesale supply transactions. Discontinued Operations In 2008, Con Edison Development and its subsidiary, CED/SCS Newington, LLC, completed the sale of their ownership interests 27 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED in power generating projects with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,706 MW. See Note V to the financial statements. Results of Operations Summary Con Edisons earnings per share in 2008 were $4.38 ($4.37 on a diluted basis). In 2007, earnings per share were $3.49 ($3.47 on a diluted basis). Earnings per share in 2006 were $2.96 ($2.95 on a diluted basis). Net income for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2008 2007 2006 Con Edison of New York $ 783 $ 844 $ 686 O&R 44 46 45 Competitive energy businesses (a) 73 58 40 Other (b) 22 (23 ) (31 ) Total continuing operations 922 925 740 Discontinued operations (c) 274 4 (3 ) Con Edison $ 1,196 $ 929 $ 737 (a) Includes $(59) million, $(5) million and $(15) million of net after tax mark to market losses in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2008, also includes $131 million after tax from the gain on sale of Con Edison Developments generation projects. See Note V to the financial statements. (b) Other consists of inter company and parent company accounting. See Results of Operations, below. (c) Represents the discontinued operations of certain of Con Edison Developments generation projects and Con Edison Communications. See Notes U and V to the financial statements. Con Edisons results of operations for 2008 include the gain on the sale of Con Edison Developments generation projects in 2008, the resolution in 2008 of litigation with Northeast Utilities, the impact of discontinued operations in 2008 and 2007 (see Note V to the financial statements) and the operating results of the competitive energy businesses (including net mark to market effects). The Companies results of operations for 2008, as compared with 2007, also reflect changes in the Utilities rate plans (including lower allowed returns on equity and additional revenues designed to recover increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes, and interest charges), an additional reserve in 2008 related to the Long Island City power outage and the resolution in 2007 of a deferred tax amortization petition (see Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in Note B to the financial statements). Operations and maintenance expenses were higher in 2008 compared with 2007 reflecting primarily higher costs, which are generally reflected in rates, such as pension and other post retirement benefits, the support and maintenance of company underground facilities to accommodate municipal projects, the write off of uncollectible accounts and additional operating programs. Depreciation and property taxes were higher in 2008 compared with 2007 reflecting primarily the impact from increased capital expenditures. 28 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED The following table presents the estimated effect on earnings per share and net income from continuing operations for 2008 as compared with 2007 and 2007 as compared with 2006, resulting from these and other major factors: 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Earningsper Share Net Income(Millions ofDollars) Earningsper Share Net Income(Millions ofDollars) Con Edison of New York Sales growth $ 0.04 $ 11 $ 0.18 $ 46 Impact of weather (0.07 ) (17 ) 0.11 28 Electric rate plan 0.47 125 0.44 109 Gas rate plan 0.13 35 0.05 12 Net transfers to firm gas service 0.05 14 Steam rate plan 0.06 15 0.08 19 Resolution of deferred tax amortization petition in 2007 and other tax matters (0.08 ) (22 ) 0.06 17 Operations and maintenance expense (0.44 ) (117 ) (0.05 ) (13 ) Long Island City power outage reserve 0.04 10 (0.10 ) (24 ) Depreciation and property taxes (0.22 ) (59 ) (0.28 ) (69 ) Net interest expense (0.07 ) (19 ) (0.04 ) (10 ) Other (includes dilutive effect of new stock issuances) (0.16 ) (23 ) (0.08 ) 29 Total Con Edison of New York (0.30 ) (61 ) 0.42 158 Orange and Rockland Utilities (0.01 ) (2 ) (0.01 ) 1 Competitive energy businesses Earnings excluding net mark to market effects, gain on sale of generation projects and discontinued operations (0.24 ) (62 ) 0.01 8 Net mark to market effects (0.20 ) (54 ) 0.04 10 Gain on the sale of Con Edison Developments generation projects and discontinued operations 1.48 401 0.02 7 Total Competitive energy businesses 1.04 285 0.07 25 Northeast Utilities litigation settlement 0.11 30 Other, including parent company expenses 0.05 15 0.05 8 Total variations $ 0.89 $ 267 $ 0.53 $ 192 See Results of Operations below for further discussion and analysis of results of operations. 29 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Risk Factors The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. These risk factors include: The Utilities Revenues And Results Of Operations Reflect Regulatory Actions The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the prices they can charge their customers. The prices are generally designed to cover the Utilities cost of service (including a return on equity) and generally may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than for the recovery of energy costs and limited other exceptions. The rate plans generally include earnings adjustments for meeting or failing to meet certain standards. Certain of the plans require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. Regulators may also take actions affecting the company outside of the framework of the approved rate plans. The regulators in the states in which the Utilities provide service generally permit the Utilities to recover from their customers the cost of service, other than any cost that is determined to have been imprudently incurred. Regulatory policies are subject to change. The Utilities regulatory filings can involve complex accounting and other calculations. See Application of Critical Accounting Polices and Regulatory Matters, below. Con Edisons Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Is Subject To Regulatory Restrictions Con Edisons ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its businesses. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are generally limited to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See Dividends in Note C to the financial statements. The Companies Purchase Energy For Their Customers A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or in the Companies energy supply arrangements could adversely affect their ability to meet their customers energy needs and the Companies results of operations. The Companies have policies to manage the economic risks related to energy supply, including related hedging transactions and the risk of a counterpartys non performance. The Utilities generally recover their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including the cost of hedging transactions, in accordance with rate provisions approved by state regulators. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses enter into hedging transactions to manage their commodity related price and volumetric risks. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below. Energy Market Prices Are Volatile The impact of changing energy market prices on the Companies is mitigated by their energy management policies and rate provisions pursuant to which the Utilities recover energy supply costs. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below. High energy market prices result in increases in energy costs billed to customers that could result in decreased energy usage. If this were to occur, until rates for Con Edison of New Yorks steam business, O&Rs electric businesses in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and O&Rs gas business were adjusted to offset the effect of decreased usage, the Utilities would have decreased energy delivery revenues. Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms currently applicable to Con Edison of New Yorks electric and gas businesses and O&Rs electric business in New York, the Utilities revenues will generally not be affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. See Note B to the financial statements. Prices for electricity, fuel oil and gas could also affect the value of Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. The Utilities Have A Substantial Ongoing Utility Construction Program The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $7 billion over the next three years. The ongoing construction program includes large energy transmission, substation and distribution system projects. The failure to complete these projects in a timely manner could adversely affect the Utilities ability to meet their customers growing energy needs with the high level of reliability that they currently provide. A substantial portion of the construction program is undertaken through contractors. See Investigation of Contractor Payments in Note H to the financial statements. The Utilities expect to use internally generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison and external borrowings to fund the construction expenditures. The Companies Are Active Participants in Financial Markets Changes in financial market conditions or in the Companies credit ratings could adversely affect their ability and their cost to borrow funds. The Companies commercial paper and unsecured debt are rated by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. (Moodys), Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). The interest rates on $636 million of Con Edison of New York tax exempt debt and $99 million of O&R tax exempt debt are also affected by the credit ratings of bond insurers. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital 30 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Resources, below. Changes to financial market conditions could also adversely affect the return on investment of the plan assets for the Companies pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and in 2008 did materially adversely affect the value of the plan assets. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits and Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below and Notes E and F to the financial statements. The Companies Operate Essential Energy Facilities And Other Systems The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities that are located either in, or close to, public places. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. See Manhattan Steam Main Rupture in Note H to the financial statements. The Companies have energy facilities, information systems and business processes relating to their operations, billing, accounting and other matters, the failure of which could adversely affect the Companies operations and liquidity and result in substantial liability, higher costs and increased regulatory requirements. The Companies have training, operating, security, maintenance and capital programs designed to provide for the safe and reliable operation of their energy facilities, information systems and business processes. Con Edisons Competitive Energy Businesses Are In Evolving Markets Con Edisons competitive energy businesses are active in evolving markets that are affected by the actions of governmental agencies, other organizations (such as independent system operators) and other competitive businesses. Compared to the Utilities, the profitability of their products and services and the recoverability of Con Edisons investment in these competitive energy businesses is not as predictable. The Companies May Be Affected By The Application Of Critical Accounting Policies And Rules The application of the Companies critical accounting policies reflects complex judgments, assumptions and estimates. These policies, which are described in Application of Critical Accounting Policies below, include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities, the accounting and funding rules applicable to pensions and other postretirement benefits, and accounting for contingencies, long lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases. New accounting policies or rules or changes to current accounting policies, rules or interpretations of such policies or rules that affect the Companies financial statements may be adopted by the relevant accounting or other authorities. The Companies Are Exposed To Risks Relating To Environmental Matters Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See Environmental Matters in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements. Electric and magnetic fields (EMF) are found wherever electricity is used. If a causal relationship between EMF and adverse health effects were established, there could be a material adverse effect on the Companies. Negative perceptions about EMF can make it more difficult to construct facilities needed for the Companies operations. The Companies Are Subject To Extensive Government Regulation And Taxation The Companies operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. The Companies federal income tax returns reflect certain tax positions with which the Internal Revenue Service does not or may not agree, including tax positions with respect to Con Edisons lease in/lease out transactions and the deduction of certain construction related costs for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. See Notes J and L to the financial statements. The Companies may be subject to new laws or regulations or the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies. The Companies Face Risks That Are Beyond Their Control The Companies results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. Economic conditions can affect customers demand and ability to pay for service. The cost of repairing damage to the Companies facilities and the potential disruption of their operations due to heat, storms, natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts, pandemic illnesses and other catastrophic events could be substantial. See Environmental Matters Climate Change in Item 1. The occurrence or risk of occurrence of future terrorist attacks or related acts of war could also adversely affect the New York or United States economy. A lower level of economic activity for these or other reasons could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could adversely affect the Companies revenues and earnings and limit the Companies future growth prospects. Global Financial Turmoil is Ongoing Ongoing global financial turmoil has reduced the availability, and increased the cost, of 31 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED credit and capital and reduced the value of financial assets. The economy has entered a recession. The Companies continue to monitor the effects on their businesses of these events. See The Companies Are Active Participants in Financial Markets and The Companies Face Risks That Are Beyond Their Control, above and Capital Resources and Capital Requirements, below. For information about potential for material pension plan funding requirements, see Note E to the financial statements. The ongoing turmoil could also reduce customer demand for the services provided by the Companies and the ability of the Companies customers, lenders and other counterparties to meet their obligations to the Companies. Forward Looking Statements This report includes forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward looking statements are statements of future expectation and not facts. Words such as expects, estimates, anticipates, intends, believes, plans, will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are based on information available at the time the statements are made, and accordingly speak only as of that time. Actual results or developments might differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements because of various factors such as those discussed under Risk Factors, above. Application of Critical Accounting Policies The Companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies critical accounting policies include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases. Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities The Utilities are subject to SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction. SFAS No. 71 specifies the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under SFAS No. 71. The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in Note B to the financial statements. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission. In the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery (as required by SFAS No. 71), these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December 31, 2008, the regulatory assets for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $9 billion and $8 billion, respectively. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses also provide such benefits to certain of their employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R), SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. In addition, the Utilities apply SFAS No. 71 to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in Note B to the financial statements, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes E and F to the financial statements for information about the Companies pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2008, 2007 and 2006. The cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks current 32 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED estimates for 2009 are increases, compared with 2008, in their pension and other postretirement benefits cost of $150 million and $144 million, respectively. The discount rate used to determine 2009 pension and other postretirement benefit accounting cost is 5.75 percent and the expected return on plan assets (tax exempt assets for postretirement benefit accounting costs) is 8.5 percent. Amortization of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to increase Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks pension and other postretirement benefit costs by an additional $68 million and $65 million, respectively, in 2010. A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2009, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 8.5 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for both Con Edison and Con Edison of New York by approximately $12 million and $11 million, respectively, in 2010. The discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly rated (Aa and Aaa, by Moodys) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments. In determining the health care cost trend rate, the Companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends. The following table illustrates the effect on 2009 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant: ActuarialAssumption Change inAssumption Pension Other Postretirement Benefits Total (Millions of Dollars) Increase in accounting cost: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 30 $ 4 $ 34 Con Edison of New York (0.25 %) $ 28 $ 4 $ 32 Expected return on plan assets Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 20 $ 3 $ 23 Con Edison of New York (0.25 %) $ 19 $ 2 $ 21 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % $ 3 $ 3 Con Edison of New York 1.00 % $ (1 ) $ (1 ) ActuarialAssumption Change inAssumption Pension Other Postretirement Benefits Total (Millions of Dollars) Increase in projected benefit obligation: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 288 $ 47 $ 335 Con Edison of New York (0.25 %) $ 271 $ 40 $ 311 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % $ 17 $ 17 Con Edison of New York 1.00 % $ (5 ) $ (5 ) Pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which Con Edison of New York, O&R and the competitive energy businesses make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2008 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, Con Edison of New York, O&R and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses made discretionary contributions to the plan in 2008 of $127 million, $34 million and $0.6 million, respectively, and expect to make discretionary contributions in 2009 for Con Edison of New York and O&R of $253 million and $37 million, respectively. The Companies policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible and for the Utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate agreements. See Expected Contributions in Notes E and F to the financial statements. Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, applies to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include the Utilities responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G); certain tax matters (Notes J and L); and other contingencies (Note H). In accordance with SFAS No. 5, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated. 33 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED The Utilities generally recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings. Accounting for Long Lived Assets SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under SFAS No. 144, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value. Accounting for Goodwill In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Con Edison is required to annually test goodwill for impairment. See Note K to the financial statements. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill. Goodwill was $411 million at December 31, 2008. The most recent test, which was performed during the fourth quarter of 2008, did not require any second step assessment and did not result in any impairment. The companys most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values. The company estimated fair values based primarily on discounted cash flows and on market values for a proxy group of companies. Accounting for Derivative Instruments The Companies apply SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, and other related accounting pronouncements to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below and Note O to the financial statements. Where the Companies are required to make mark to market estimates pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources. Accounting for Leases The Companies apply SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and other related pronouncements to their leasing transactions. See Note J to the financial statements for information about Con Edison Developments Lease In/Lease Out or LILO transactions, a disallowance of tax losses by the Internal Revenue Service and a possible future charge to earnings. In accordance with SFAS No. 13, Con Edison accounted for the two LILO transactions as leveraged leases. Accordingly, the companys investment in these leases, net of non recourse debt, is carried as a single amount in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet and income is recognized pursuant to a method that incorporates a level rate of return for those years when net investment in the lease is positive, based upon the after tax cash flows projected at the inception of the leveraged leases. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below. The principal factors affecting Con Edisons liquidity are its investments in the Utilities, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities and cash flows from financing activities discussed below. The principal factors affecting Con Edison of New Yorks liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures), the dividends it pays to Con Edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below. The Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short term borrowing to meet their working capital needs 34 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short term borrowings using funds from long term financings and operating activities. The Utilities cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers. Each of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short term and long term cash requirements. See Risk FactorsGlobal Financial Turmoil is Ongoing, and Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Contingencies, above, and Regulatory Matters, below. Changes in the Companies cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are summarized as follows: Con Edison (Millions of Dollars) 2008 2007 Variance 2008 vs. 2007 2006 Variance 2007 vs. 2006 Operating activities $ 629 $ 1,555 $ (926 ) $ 1,354 $ 201 Investing activities (1,071 ) (2,086 ) 1,015 (1,918 ) (168 ) Financing activities 306 647 (341 ) 577 70 Net change (136 ) 116 (252 ) 13 103 Balance at beginning of period 210 94 116 81 13 Balance at end of period $ 74 $ 210 $ (136 ) $ 94 $ 116 Con Edison of New York (Millions of Dollars) 2008 2007 Variance 2008 vs. 2007 2006 Variance 2007 vs. 2006 Operating activities $ 1,036 $ 1,251 $ (215 ) $ 1,163 $ 88 Investing activities (2,448 ) (2,021 ) (427 ) (1,839 ) (182 ) Financing activities 1,328 844 484 662 182 Net change (84 ) 74 (158 ) (14 ) 88 Balance at beginning ofperiod 121 47 74 61 (14 ) Balance at end of period $ 37 $ 121 $ (84 ) $ 47 $ 74 Cash Flows from Operating Activities The Utilities cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is dependent primarily on factors external to the Utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy, economic conditions and measures that promote energy efficiency. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate agreements. In general, changes in the Utilities cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate agreements. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements. Net income is the result of cash and non cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies cash flows from operating activities. Principal non cash charges include depreciation and deferred income tax expense. Principal non cash credits include the revenue requirement impact resulting from the reconciliation pursuant to Con Edison of New Yorks 2005 electric rate agreement of the differences between the actual amount of transmission and distribution utility plant, net of depreciation to the amounts reflected in electric rates (Net T&D Revenues) and amortizations of certain net regulatory liabilities. Non cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in Con Edison of New Yorks current electric and gas rate plans and O&Rs electric rate plan. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, and Notes E and F to the financial statements and see Rate AgreementsCon Edison of New YorkElectric and O&RElectric in Note B to the financial statements. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2008 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $926 million and $215 million lower, respectively, than in the 2007 period. The decreases reflect primarily the July 2008 prepayment, by Con Edison of New York, of its annual New York City property taxes in the amount of $915 million. By prepaying this annual amount as opposed to paying in semi annual installments, Con Edison of New York received a 1.5 percent reduction in its New York City property taxes. Con Edisons decrease also reflects the 2008 payment of income taxes, which includes the taxes on the gain on the sale of Con Edison Developments generation projects. The decreases also reflect higher cash collateral paid due to lower commodity prices associated with the Companies derivative transactions. Con Edison and Con Edison of New Yorks decrease is offset by lower rate case amortizations and the reconciliation of Net T&D in 2008 when compared with 2007. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2007 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $201 million and $88 million higher, respectively, than in the 2006 period primarily reflecting increased net income, depreciation expense, deferred income taxes and recovery of certain other receivables, described below, offset in part by higher non cash credits for Net T&D Revenues, rate case amortizations and accruals and higher customer accounts receivable. The change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. This timing issue is reflected within changes to accounts receivablecustomers, recoverable energy costs and accounts payable balances. In 2007, the change in other deferred charges and noncurrent assets reflects 35 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED a $160 million deposit paid by Con Edison to the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the timing of deductions of certain construction related costs. See Note L to the financial statements. Con Edison of New Yorks and O&Rs portion of this deposit, also recorded as a noncurrent asset, was $147 million and $13 million, respectively. The increases in regulatory assets principally reflects increases in deferred pension costs in accordance with SFAS No. 158 and increases in future federal income taxes associated with increased removal costs. See Notes A, B and E to the financial statements. The decrease in other receivables in 2007 reflects primarily the recovery of a property tax credit associated with Con Edison of New Yorks East River Plant and lower hedging program broker margin deposits (reflecting higher commodity prices). For Con Edison, the decrease also reflects the expiration of certain wholesale load contracts, and receivables associated with other hedging activities at the competitive energy businesses. Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities in 2008 for Con Edison were $1,015 million lower than in 2007. The decrease reflects primarily the proceeds from the sale of Con Edison Developments generation projects in 2008 offset, in part, by increased utility construction expenditures. Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison of New York was $427 million higher in 2008 than in 2007, reflecting primarily increased utility construction expenditures in 2008. From time to time, Con Edison of New York lends funds to O&R for periods of not more than 12 months. Con Edison of New Yorks outstanding loans to O&R amounted to $113 million and $55 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. See Note S to the financial statements. Net cash flows used in investing activities in 2007 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $168 million and $182 million higher, respectively, than in 2006. The increases for the Companies reflect primarily increased utility construction expenditures and lower net proceeds from the sale of certain properties ($30 million in 2007, as compared with $60 million in 2006). For Con Edison, the increase also reflects $39 million of net proceeds from the completion of the sale of Con Edison Communications that offset cash flows used in investing activities in 2006. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities in 2008 for Con Edison were $341 million lower than in 2007 and for Con Edison of New York were $484 million higher in 2008 than in 2007, and increased $70 million and $182 million, respectively, in 2007 compared with 2006. Con Edisons cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, reflect the issuance through public offerings of 11 million and 9.7 million Con Edison common shares resulting in net proceeds of $558 million and $447 million, respectively. The 2007 proceeds were invested by Con Edison in Con Edison of New York ($518 million) and O&R ($40 million). The $447 million from the 2006 proceeds were invested in Con Edison of New York. For Con Edison of New York, cash flows from financing activities in 2008 also reflect a $752 million capital contribution from Con Edison. Cash flows from financing activities for 2008, 2007 and 2006 also reflect the issuance of Con Edison common shares through its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans (2008: 1.7 million shares for $42 million, 2007: 3.6 million shares for $121 million, 2006: 2.5 million shares for $63 million). In addition, as a result of the stock plan issuances, cash used to pay common stock dividends was reduced by $21 million in 2008, $38 million in 2007 and $40 million in 2006. Net cash flows from financing activities during the years ending December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 also reflect the following Con Edison of New York transactions: 2008 Issued $600 million 5.85% 10 year debentures, $600 million 6.75% 30 year debentures and $600 million 7.125% 10 year debentures, the proceeds of which were used to repay short term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes; and Redeemed at maturity $180 million 6.25% 10 year debentures and $100 million 6.15% 10 year debentures. 2007 Issued $525 million 6.30% 30 year debentures, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes; and Redeemed at maturity $330 million 6.45% 10 year debentures. 2006 Issued $400 million 5.85% 30 year debentures, $250 million 5.30% 10 year debentures and $250 million 5.70% 30 year debentures, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes; 36 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Issued $400 million 6.20% 30 year debentures, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes and to redeem in advance of maturity $100 million 7.75% debentures due 2026; and Issued $400 million 5.50% 10 year debentures, the proceeds of which were used to redeem in advance of maturity $400 million 7.50% debentures due 2041. In 2008, Con Edison issued $326 million of unsecured notes in exchange for a like amount of secured project debt (see Note Q to the financial statements) and redeemed at maturity $200 million 3.625% 5 year debentures. In 2007, Con Edison issued commercial paper and used available cash balances to redeem in advance of maturity $325 million 7.25% 40 year Public Income NotES. Con Edisons net cash flows from financing activities also include O&Rs financings. In 2008, O&R issued $50 million 6.15% 10 year debentures. The net proceeds received from the issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of short term debt. In 2007, O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary redeemed at maturity $20 million 7.125% First Mortgage Bonds. In 2006, O&R issued $75 million of 5.45% 10 year debentures. Cash flows from financing activities of the Companies also reflect commercial paper issuance (included on the consolidated balance sheets as Notes payable). The commercial paper amounts outstanding at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 and the average daily balances for 2008, 2007 and 2006 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 (Millions ofDollars, exceptWeightedAverage Yield) Out standing at Dec. 31 Dailyaverage Out standing at Dec. 31 Dailyaverage Out standingat Dec. 31 Dailyaverage Con Edison $ 363 $ 100 $ 840 $ 160 $ 117 $ 448 Con Edison of New York $ 253 $ 380 $ 555 $ 151 $ $ 305 Weighted average yield 2.4 % 3.4 % 5.5 % 5.3 % 5.4 % 5.0 % Common stock issuances and external borrowings are sources of liquidity that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital market conditions. For information about the Companies credit ratings and certain financial ratios, see Capital Resources, below. Other Changes in Assets and Liabilities The following table shows changes in certain assets and liabilities at December 31, 2008, compared with December 31, 2007. (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison2008 vs. 2007Variance Con Edison ofNew York2008 vs. 2007Variance Assets Regulatory assets $ 3,594 $ 3,416 Deferred derivative losses current 215 188 Fair value of derivative assets current 64 5 Liabilities Pension and retiree benefits 3,573 3,421 Fair value of derivative liabilities current 116 67 Regulatory Assets and Pension and Retiree Benefits Liability Regulatory assets increased $3,594 million and $3,416 million for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York, respectively, at December 31, 2008 compared with December 31, 2007, due primarily to an increase in the regulatory asset for unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs. Pension and retiree benefits liability increased $3,573 million and $3,421 million for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York, respectively, at December 31, 2008 compared with December 31, 2007, due primarily to a decrease during 2008 in the fair value of the Companies retirement plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets. See Notes B, E and F to the financial statements. Fair Value of Derivative Assets/Liabilities and Deferred Derivative Gains/Losses Fair value of derivative assets increased $64 million and $5 million for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York, respectively, at December 31, 2008 compared with December 31, 2007. The changes for Con Edison are due primarily to forward price decline for energy on the portfolio of the competitive energy businesses. In addition, fair value of derivative liabilities increased $116 million and $67 million for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York, respectively, at December 31, 2008 compared with December 31, 2007. The changes are due primarily to the impact of lower electric and gas commodity prices on the hedging portfolios of the Utilities and competitive energy businesses and the timing of entering into new positions, offset in part by the maturity of certain contract positions and cash collateral. Deferred derivative losses increased $215 million and $188 million for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York, respectively, at December 31, 2008 compared with December 31, 2007. The changes are due primarily to the impact of lower electric and gas commodity prices on the hedging portfolios of the Utilities and the timing of entering into new positions, offset in part, by the maturity of certain contract positions. 37 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED For the Utilities, mark to market activity had no effect on net income as the amounts were deferred as regulatory assets/liabilities (deferred derivative losses/gains). In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers their energy supply costs, including gains and losses on derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchases. The mark to market accounting for Con Edisons competitive energy businesses resulted in a net increase in the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities. The competitive energy businesses record mark to market gains and losses on derivative instruments in earnings in the reporting period in which such changes occur. See Note O to the financial statements. For the Companies, changes in fair value of derivative instruments may lead to collateral payments made to or received from counterparties or brokers that are reflected in the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities. Capital Resources Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through the sale of securities including the issuance in 2009 of between $300 million and $550 million of Con Edison common shares in addition to stock issuances under its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans and from dividends it receives from its subsidiaries. Con Edisons ability to make payments on its external borrowings and dividends on its common shares is also dependent on its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its interests in its subsidiaries. For information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see Note C to the financial statements. For information on the Companies commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see Note D to the financial statements. The Utilities expect to finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally generated funds, contributions of equity capital from Con Edison and external borrowings, including long term debt of between $1,100 million and $1,800 million in addition to debt issuances for maturing securities in 2009. The Companies continue to evaluate their plans to finance their capital requirements in light of the ongoing extraordinary volatility and uncertainty in capital markets and the current Con Edison of New York electric rate proceeding. See Risk Factors Global Financial Turmoil is Ongoing, above. The Companies require access to the capital markets to fund capital requirements that are substantially in excess of available internally generated funds. See Capital Requirements, below. Each of the Companies believes that it will continue to be able to access capital, although capital market instability may affect the timing of the Companies financing activities and capital costs are expected to be higher than have been experienced in recent years. The Companies monitor the availability and costs of various forms of capital, and will seek to issue Con Edison common stock and other securities when it is necessary or advantageous to do so. For information about the Companies long term debt and short term borrowing, see Notes C and D to the financial statements. In May 2005, the PSC authorized Con Edison of New York to issue up to $4.4 billion of debt securities prior to December 31, 2009, of which the company had issued $4.0 billion at December 31, 2008. In October 2008, the company filed a request with the PSC for authorization to issue additional securities prior to December 31, 2012. In January 2006, the PSC authorized O&R to issue up to $325 million of debt securities prior to December 31, 2009, of which the company had issued $125 million as of December 31, 2008. In addition, the PSC has authorized the Utilities to refund outstanding debt securities and preferred stock should the Utilities determine that it is economic to do so. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions and borrowings from Con Edison, internally generated funds and external borrowings. See Note Q to the financial statements. For each of the Companies, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges (Securities and Exchange Commission basis) for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was: Earnings to Fixed Charges(Times) 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Con Edison 3.4 3.4 3.0 3.3 2.8 Con Edison of New York 3.3 3.6 3.2 3.6 3.1 For each of the Companies, the common equity ratio at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was: Common Equity Ratio (Percent of totalcapitalization) 2008 2007 2006 Con Edison 50.7 53.7 48.5 Con Edison of New York 50.8 52.3 50.0 38 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED The commercial paper of the Companies is rated P 1, A 2 and F2, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. Con Edisons long term credit rating is A2, BBB and BBB, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. The unsecured debt of Con Edison of New York is rated A1, A and A , respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. The unsecured debt of O&R is rated A2, A and A, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Con Edison of New York has $636 million of tax exempt debt for which the interest rates are determined pursuant to periodic auctions. Of this amount, $391 million is insured by Ambac Assurance Corporation and $245 million is insured by Syncora Guarantee Inc. (formerly XL Capital Assurance Inc.). Credit rating agencies have downgraded the ratings of these insurers from AAA to lower levels. The weighted average annual interest rate on this tax exempt debt was 1.14 percent on January 31, 2009. The weighted average interest rate was 3.94 percent, 3.77 percent and 3.45 percent for the years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Con Edison of New York has $225 million of uninsured tax exempt debt and O&R has $99 million of insured tax exempt debt that currently bear interest at rates determined weekly and is subject to tender by bondholders for purchase by the company. Bondholders have tendered portions of this debt for purchase (see Note C to the financial statements). Of the $99 million of O&R debt, $55 million is insured by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company and $44 million is insured by Ambac Assurance Corporation (see Note C to the financial statements). Downgrades in the credit ratings of these insurers have resulted in interest rates on this O&R debt that are significantly higher than the interest rates borne by Con Edison of New Yorks $225 million of uninsured weekly rate tender bonds. As of January 31, 2009, the weighted average annual interest rate on the O&R insured weekly rate tender bonds outstanding with bondholders, excluding the effects of an interest rate swap agreement (see Interest Rate Swaps in Note O to the financial statements), was 9.00 percent and the rate on the Con Edison of New York weekly rate tender bonds was 0.49 percent. O&R is evaluating alternatives with respect to its weekly rate tender bonds and termination of its interest rate swap agreement. 39 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Capital Requirements The following table contains the Companies capital requirements for the years 2006 through 2008 and their current estimate of amounts for 2009 through 2011.

The Utilities have an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to meet the growth in demand for electricity and electric, gas and steam reliability needs. The balances in 2006, 2007 and 2008 reflect a higher level of expenditures for electric substations and ongoing improvements and reinforcements of the electric distribution system. The Utilities estimated construction expenditures for 2009, 2010, and 2011 are subject to change depending on the outcome of certain regulatory proceedings. See Note B to the financial statements. 40 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Companies material obligations at December 31, 2008 to make payments pursuant to contracts.

(b) Included in these amounts is the cost of minimum quantities of natural gas supply, transportation and storage that the Utilities are obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. (c) Amounts shown for other purchase obligations, which reflect capital and operations and maintenance costs incurred by the Utilities in running their day to day operations, were derived from the Utilities purchasing systems as the difference between the amounts authorized and the amounts paid (or vouchered to be paid) for each obligation. For many of these obligations, the Utilities are committed to purchase less than the amount authorized. Payments for the Other Purchase Obligations are generally assumed to be made ratably over the term of the obligations. The Utilities believe that unreasonable effort and expense would be involved to modify their purchasing systems to enable them to report their Other Purchase Obligations in a different manner. (d) Amounts represent commitments to purchase minimum quantities of electric energy and capacity, natural gas, natural gas pipeline capacity and generating plant services entered into by Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. 41 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED The Companies commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments include their other liabilities reflected in their balance sheets, any funding obligations for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans, financial hedging activities, their collective bargaining agreements and Con Edisons guarantees of certain obligations of its businesses. See Notes E, F, O and Guarantees in Note H to the financial statements. Electric Power Requirements In 2008, the Utilities purchased substantially all of the energy they sold to customers pursuant to firm contracts and through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market. Con Edison expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2009. In general, the Utilities recover prudently incurred purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks Commodity Price Risk, below and Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements. From time to time certain parties have petitioned the PSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity. To reduce the volatility of electric energy costs, the Utilities have firm contracts to purchase electric energy and enter into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of their expected purchases under these contracts and through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market, which together cover a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to customers in 2009. See Notes I and O to the financial statements. O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary entered into firm contracts to purchase electric energy for substantially all of the electric energy expected to be sold to its customers in 2009. Con Edison of New York also owns generating stations in New York City associated primarily with its steam system. As of December 31, 2008, the generating stations had a combined electric capacity of approximately 710 MW, based on 2008 summer ratings. O&R does not own any electric generating capacity. In a July 1998 order, the PSC indicated that it agree(s) generally that Con Edison of New York need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops, but considers overly broad and did not adopt Con Edison of New Yorks request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, it will no longer be required to engage in long range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of capacity. Con Edison of New York monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO. In December 2007, the PSC initiated a proceeding to consider a form of integrated resource planning, which could involve the imposition of obligations on transmission owners (such as Con Edison of New York), that may be needed for system reliability if the market does not solve a reliability need identified by the NYISO. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses sell electricity to wholesale and retail customers in the NYISO, PJM Interconnection (PJM), ISO New England (ISO NE) and other markets. Con Edison Energy sells the electric capacity and energy produced by plants owned, leased or operated by others. In 2008, Con Edison Development and its subsidiary, CED/SCS Newington, LLC, completed the sale of their ownership interests in power generating projects with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,706 MW. See Note V to the financial statements. 42 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Regulatory Matters The following table, which summarizes certain significant provisions of the Utilities principal rate plans, should be read in conjunction with, and is subject to, the more detailed discussion of these plans and prior rate plans in Note B to the financial statements.

In May 2008, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC for an electric rate increase of $654 million. O&R has pending a request with the PSC for an increase in the rates it charges for gas service rendered in New York, effective November 2009, of $17.8 million. See Note B to the financial statements. The Companies are actively participating in regulatory proceedings at the federal and state level related to advancing policies such as efforts to increase investment in infrastructure, including transmission, renewables and smart grid. The Companies also participate in other federal regulatory proceedings that affect electric capacity and energy markets in New York and PJM regions, and those that affect gas pipeline companies. 43 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Financial and Commodity Market Risks The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk. Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. The Companies estimate that at December 31, 2008, each 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks variable rate debt and commercial paper would result in a change in annual interest expense of $3 million and $2 million, respectively. In addition, from time to time, Con Edison and its businesses enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See Interest Rate Swaps in Note O to the financial statements. Commodity Price Risk Con Edisons commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note O to the financial statements. Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2008, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $126 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $91 million is for Con Edison of New York and $35 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses use a value at risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of instruments or the portfolio due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. These businesses estimate VaR across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for transactions associated with hedges on generating assets and commodity contracts, assuming a one day holding period, for the years ended December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively, was as follows: 95% Confidence Level, One Day Holding Period 2008 2007 (Millions of Dollars) Average for the period $ 2 $ 3 High 3 7 Low 1 Credit Risk The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. Credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterpartys nonperformance. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, netting provisions within agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements, credit insurance and credit default swaps. The Companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff. Con Edison of New York had $67 million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral, at December 31, 2008. The entire amount was with commodity exchange brokers. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses had $222 million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral, at December 31, 2008, of which $183 million was with investment grade counterparties, $37 million was with commodity exchange brokers or independent system operators and $2 million was with non investment grade counterparties. Investment Risk The Companies investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, above. The Companies current investment policy for pension plan assets 44 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED includes investment targets of 65 percent equities and 35 percent fixed income and other securities. At December 31, 2008, the pension plan investments consisted of 59 percent equity and 41 percent fixed income and other securities. In 2008, financial market conditions materially adversely affected the value of the plan assets. See Notes E and F to the financial statements. Environmental Matters For information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos, see Environmental Matters in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements. Impact of Inflation The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies long term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. Also, to the extent the Companies prices change by more or less than inflation, the real price of the Companies services will increase or decline. Over the past 20 years, for example, the real price of electric service has declined substantially. Material Contingencies For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies material contingencies, see Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies, above, and Notes B, G, H, J and L to the financial statements. Results of Operations Results of operations reflect, among other things, the Companies accounting policies (see Application of Critical Accounting Policies, above) and rate plans that cover the rates the Utilities can charge their customers (see Regulatory Matters, above). Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms currently applicable to Con Edison of New Yorks electric and gas businesses and O&Rs electric business in New York, the Utilities revenues will generally not be affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. Revenues for Con Edison of New Yorks steam business and O&Rs other utility businesses are affected by changes in delivery volumes resulting from weather, economic conditions and other factors. See Note B to the financial statements. Con Edisons results of operations for 2008 include the gain on the sale of Con Edison Developments generation projects in 2008, the resolution in 2008 of litigation with Northeast Utilities, the impact of discontinued operations in 2008 and 2007 (see Note V to the financial statements) and the operating results of the competitive energy businesses (including net mark to market effects). The Companies results of operations for 2008, as compared with 2007, also reflect changes in the Utilities rate plans (including lower allowed returns on equity and additional revenues designed to recover increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes, and interest charges), an additional reserve in 2008 related to the Long Island City power outage and the resolution in 2007 of a deferred tax amortization petition (see Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in Note B to the financial statements). Operations and maintenance expenses were higher in 2008 compared with 2007 reflecting primarily higher costs, which are generally reflected in rates, such as pension and other post retirement benefits, the support and maintenance of company underground facilities to accommodate municipal projects, the write off of uncollectible accounts and additional operating programs. Depreciation and property taxes were higher in 2008 compared with 2007 reflecting primarily the impact from increased capital expenditures. For additional information about major factors affecting earnings, see Results of Operations Summary, above. In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel, gas purchased for resale and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full service customers (see Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A and Regulatory Matters in Note B to the financial statements). Accordingly, such costs do not generally affect the Companies results of operations. Management uses the term net revenues (operating revenues less such costs) to identify changes in operating revenues that may affect the Companies results of operations. Management believes that, although net revenues may not be a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the measure facilitates the analysis by management and investors of the Companies results of operations. Con Edisons principal business segments are Con Edison of New Yorks regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities, O&Rs regulated electric and gas utility activities and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. Con Edison of New Yorks principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities. A discussion of the results of operations by principal business segment for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 follows. For additional business segment financial information, see Note N to the financial statements. 45 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2007 The Companies results of operations (which were discussed above under Results of Operations Summary) in 2008 compared with 2007 were: Con Edison* Con Edison of New York O&R Competitive EnergyBusinesses and Other** (Millions of Dollars) Increases(Decreases)Amount Increases(Decreases)Percent Increases(Decreases)Amount Increases(Decreases)Percent Increases(Decreases)Amount Increases(Decreases)Percent Increases(Decreases)Amount Increases(Decreases)Percent Operating revenues $ 463 3.5 % $ 539 5.5 % $ 55 5.9 % $ (131 ) (5.7 )% Purchased power 321 5.9 171 5.7 49 12.8 101 5.0 Fuel 39 6.3 72 12.2 N/A N/A (33 ) (91.7 ) Gas purchased for resale (1 ) (0.1 ) 21 2.1 (7 ) (4.2 ) (15 ) (51.7 ) Operating revenues less purchased power, fuel and gas purchasedfor resale (net revenues) 104 1.8 275 5.2 13 3.4 (184 ) (90.2 ) Other operations and maintenance 179 8.6 157 8.8 19 9.4 3 3.1 Depreciation and amortization 72 11.2 79 13.3 2 5.3 (9 ) (64.3 ) Taxes, other than income taxes 41 3.1 41 3.2 2 4.8 (2 ) (11.1 ) Income taxes 60 13.3 4 1.0 (1 ) (4.2 ) 57 Large Gain on sale of generation projects*** 261 Large N/A N/A N/A N/A 261 Large Operating income 13 0.9 (6 ) (0.5 ) (9 ) (11.4 ) 28 71.8 Other income less deductions and related federal income tax 11 23.4 (21 ) (58.3 ) 1 Large 31 Large Net interest expense 27 5.2 34 7.4 (6 ) (17.6 ) (1 ) (4.0 ) Income from continuing operations (3 ) (0.3 ) (61 ) (7.2 ) (2 ) (4.3 ) 60 Large Gain on sale of generation projects, net of tax*** 270 Large N/A N/A N/A N/A 270 Large Income from discontinued operations, net of tax *** N/A N/A N/A N/A Net income $ 267 28.7 % $ (61 ) (7.2 )% $ (2 ) (4.3 )% $ 330 Large * Represents the consolidated financial results of Con Edison and its businesses. ** Includes inter company and parent company accounting. *** See Note V to the financial statements. 46 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Con Edison of New York Electric Con Edison of New Yorks electric sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2008 compared with 2007 were: Millions of kWhs Delivered Revenues in Millions Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Description December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Variation PercentVariation December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Variation PercentVariation Residential/Religious 11,720 12,312 (592 ) (4.8 )% $ 2,834 $ 2,657 $ 177 6.7 % Commercial/Industrial 12,852 12,918 (66 ) (0.5 ) 2,720 2,486 234 9.4 Retail access customers 22,047 21,532 515 2.4 1,507 1,334 173 13.0 NYPA, Municipal Agency and other sales 11,704 11,499 205 1.8 413 342 71 20.8 Other operating revenues 404 621 (217 ) (34.9 ) Total 58,323 58,261 62 0.1 % $ 7,878 $ 7,440 $ 438 5.9 % Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating revenues increased $438 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to the electric rate plans ($201 million), increased recoverable fuel costs ($52 million) and an increase in recoverable purchased power costs ($163 million). Effective April 2008, Con Edison of New Yorks revenues from electric sales are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism, as a result of which revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. Other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the companys rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements. Electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area increased 0.1 percent in 2008 compared with 2007. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area increased 0.5 percent in 2008 compared with 2007. Con Edison of New Yorks electric fuel costs increased $52 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to an increase in unit costs ($56 million), offset by lower sendout volumes from the companys generating facilities ($4 million). Electric purchased power costs increased $163 million in 2008 compared with 2007 reflecting an increase in unit costs ($265 million), offset by a decrease in purchased volumes ($102 million). Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating income increased $4 million in 2008 compared with 2007. The increase reflects primarily higher net revenues ($223 million, due primarily to the electric rate plan), offset in part by higher operations and maintenance costs ($102 million, due primarily to a reserve associated with the Long Island City power outage ($23 million) and increased pension expenses ($67 million)), depreciation ($73 million), income taxes ($24 million) and taxes other than income taxes ($19 million, principally state and local taxes on revenue). 47 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Gas Con Edison of New Yorks gas sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2008 compared with 2007 were: Thousands of dths Delivered Revenues in Millions Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Description December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Variation PercentVariation December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Variation PercentVariation Residential 40,195 42,573 (2,378 ) (5.6 )% $ 850 $ 842 $ 8 1.0 % General 28,748 31,162 (2,414 ) (7.7 ) 482 499 (17 ) (3.4 ) Firm transportation 43,245 39,016 4,229 10.8 202 168 34 20.2 Total firm sales and transportation 112,188 112,751 (563 ) (0.5 ) 1,534 1,509 25 1.7 Interruptible sales 11,220 10,577 643 6.1 138 88 50 56.8 NYPA 44,694 42,085 2,609 6.2 4 4 Generation plants 74,082 79,942 (5,860 ) (7.3 ) 55 52 3 5.8 Other 20,004 15,318 4,686 30.6 30 24 6 25.0 Other operating revenues 78 82 (4 ) (4.9 ) Total 262,188 260,673 1,515 0.6 % $ 1,839 $ 1,759 $ 80 4.5 % Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating revenues increased $80 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to an increase in recoverable purchased gas costs ($21 million), the gas rate plans ($58 million) and sales growth ($2 million). Con Edison of New Yorks revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause and, effective October 2007, a revenue decoupling mechanism as a result of which revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. Other gas operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the companys rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements. Con Edison of New Yorks sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 0.5 percent in 2008 compared with 2007, reflecting primarily the impact of the milder winter weather in 2008 compared with 2007. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the companys service area increased 0.6 percent in 2008. Con Edison of New Yorks purchased gas cost increased $21 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due to higher unit costs ($159 million), offset by lower sendout volumes ($138 million). Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating income decreased $3 million in 2008 compared with 2007. The decrease reflects primarily higher operations and maintenance expense ($38 million, due primarily to higher transmission and distribution expenses ($22 million) and higher pension expense ($9 million)), taxes other than income taxes ($20 million, principally property taxes) and depreciation ($5 million), offset in part by higher net revenues ($59 million) and lower income taxes ($3 million). 48 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Steam Con Edison of New Yorks steam sales and deliveries in 2008 compared with 2007 were: Millions of Pounds Delivered Revenues in Millions Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Description December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Variation PercentVariation December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Variation PercentVariation General 785 589 196 33.3 % $ 23 $ 23 $ % Apartment house 6,614 7,519 (905 ) (12.0 ) 186 188 (2 ) (1.1 ) Annual power 16,577 17,696 (1,119 ) (6.3 ) 468 443 25 5.6 Other operating revenues 30 32 (2 ) (6.3 ) Total 23,976 25,804 (1,828 ) (7.1 )% $ 707 $ 686 $ 21 3.1 % Con Edison of New Yorks steam operating revenues increased $21 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to the net change in rates under the steam rate plan ($25 million). Other steam operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the companys rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements. Steam sales and delivery volumes decreased 7.1 percent in 2008 compared with 2007, reflecting primarily the impact of weather. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, steam sales and deliveries decreased 3.0 percent in 2008, reflecting primarily lower customer usage. Con Edison of New Yorks steam fuel costs increased $20 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to higher unit costs ($43 million), offset by lower sendout volumes ($23 million). Steam purchased power costs increased $8 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to higher unit costs ($17 million), offset by a decrease in purchased volumes ($9 million). Steam operating income decreased $7 million in 2008 compared with 2007. The decrease reflects primarily higher operations and maintenance expense ($15 million, due primarily to higher distribution expense ($12 million)), taxes other than income taxes ($2 million, principally property taxes) and lower net revenues ($7 million), offset by lower income taxes ($17 million). Taxes Other Than Income Taxes At over $1 billion, taxes other than income taxes remain one of Con Edison of New Yorks largest operating expenses.

Income Taxes Operating income taxes increased $4 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to higher taxable income in the 2008 period. Other Income (Deductions) Other income (deductions) decreased $21 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to lower interest income in 2008. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense increased $34 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to new debt issuances, higher interest rates on floating rate debt and lower principal amounts of commercial paper outstanding in 2008. 49 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED O&R Electric O&Rs electric sales and deliveries, excluding off system sales, in 2008 compared with 2007 were: Millions of kWhs Delivered Revenues in Millions Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Description December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Variation PercentVariation December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Variation PercentVariation Residential/Religious 1,892 1,913 (21 ) (1.1 )% $ 330 $ 298 $ 32 10.7 % Commercial/Industrial 2,082 2,191 (109 ) (5.0 ) 303 283 20 7.1 Retail access customers 1,814 1,687 127 7.5 80 73 7 9.6 Public authorities 119 120 (1 ) (0.8 ) 17 15 2 13.3 Other operating revenues 3 2 1 50.0 Total 5,907 5,911 (4 ) (0.1 )% $ 733 $ 671 $ 62 9.2 % O&Rs electric operating revenues increased $62 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to increased recoverable purchased power costs ($49 million) and the impact of the electric rate plan that went into effect July 1, 2008 ($8 million). Effective July 2008, O&Rs revenues from electric sales are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism, as a result of which, revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. Other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the companys electric rate plan. See Note B to the financial statements. Electric delivery volumes in O&Rs service area decreased 0.1 percent in 2008 compared with 2007. After adjusting for weather variations and unbilled volumes, electric delivery volumes in O&Rs service area decreased 1.0 percent in 2008 compared with 2007. Electric operating income decreased by $6 million in 2008 compared with 2007. The decrease reflects primarily higher operations and maintenance expense ($19 million, due primarily to higher maintenance costs ($6 million), pension expense ($4 million) and demand management program expenses ($3 million)), depreciation ($1 million) and taxes other than income taxes ($1 million, principally property taxes), offset by higher net revenues ($13 million) and lower income taxes ($1 million).

Sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 3.4 percent in 2008 compared with 2007, reflecting the impact of the weather in 2008. After adjusting for weather and other variations, total firm sales and transportation volumes were the same in 2008 compared with 2007. O&Rs revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. Gas operating income decreased by $3 million in 2008 compared with 2007. The decrease reflects primarily higher depreciation ($1 million), income taxes ($1 million) and taxes other than income taxes ($1 million, principally state and local taxes). Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes, other than income taxes, increased $2 million in 2008 compared with 2007.

Income Taxes Operating income taxes decreased $1 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Other Income (Deductions) Other income (deductions) increased $3 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to higher interest income in 2008. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense decreased $4 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to interest accrued for the potential repayment of tax benefits from the timing of tax deductions of certain construction related costs in 2007 (see Note L to the financial statements). Competitive Energy Businesses The competitive energy businesses earnings from continuing operations increased $15 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to a $131 million gain on the sale of Con Edison Developments generation projects, offset by lower net income from generation projects, lower gross margins from electric wholesale and retail sales and mark to market losses. Income from continuing operations reflects a pre tax gain of $261 million and income taxes of $130 million, related to the sale of Con Edison Developments generation projects. Operating revenues decreased $108 million in 2008 compared with 2007, due primarily to decreased electric generation and retail revenues. Revenue from the sale of electricity from the competitive energy businesses generation facilities decreased $87 million in 2008 as compared with 2007 due to the sale of Con Edison Developments generation projects during the second quarter of 2008. Electric retail revenues decreased $54 million in 2008 as compared with 2007, due primarily to lower sales volumes ($181 million), offset by higher unit prices ($127 million). Electric retail revenues decreased 4 percent from 2007 to 2008 and gross margins decreased primarily due to lower volumes and lower per unit margins. Electric wholesale revenues increased $76 million, due primarily to higher per unit prices ($104 million), offset by lower sales volume ($28 million). Electric wholesale revenues increased by 9 percent from 2007 to 2008 and gross margin decreased primarily due to lower volumes and lower per unit margins. Net mark to market losses increased $91 million in 2008 as compared with 2007 due primarily to lower prices on electric and natural gas contracts, which were economic hedges for retail obligations (but were not accounted for as cash flow hedges). Other revenues increased $47 million in 2008 as compared with 2007 due primarily to energy services revenue. Operating expenses excluding income taxes increased $69 million in 2008 compared with 2007, reflecting increased purchased power costs ($125 million) and other operations and maintenance costs ($3 million), offset in part by lower depreciation ($9 million), fuel costs ($33 million), gas purchased for resale costs ($14 million) and taxes other than income taxes ($3 million). Other income decreased $12 million in 2008 as compared with 2007 due primarily to an impairment charge on investments in electric generating plants ($4 million) in 2008 and a gain from the sale of Con Edison Developments interest in Everpower Wind LLC in 2007 ($6 million). Income taxes increased $56 million in 2008 as compared with 2007, due primarily to the sale of Con Edison Developments generation projects. Discontinued Operations Net income from discontinued operations was the same in 2008 compared with 2007.

Sales and transportation volumes for firm customers increased 12.7 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting the impact of the weather in 2007. After adjusting for weather and other variations, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 0.3 percent higher in 2007 compared with 2006. O&Rs revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather related changes on net income. Non firm transportation of customer owned gas to electric generating plants increased in 2007 compared with 2006 because certain facilities resumed burning gas to generate electricity. The increase in gas burned had minimal impact on earnings because most revenues from these customers result from a fixed demand charge for local transportation. Gas operating income increased by $6 million in 2007 compared with 2006. The increase reflects higher net revenues ($13 million) and lower taxes other than income taxes ($1 million, principally property taxes), offset in part by higher operations and maintenance costs ($7 million), income taxes ($1 million) and depreciation ($1 million). 57 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON AND CON EDISON OF NEW YORK) CONTINUED Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes, other than income taxes, decreased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006.
