ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the Companys results, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Equifax Inc. is a leading source of consumer and commercial credit information worldwide. The Company provides to a wide range of customers information management, consumer credit information, marketing, business information, and identity verification services to enable credit and business decisions. The Company, through its Consumer Direct business, provides credit reporting and identity theft monitoring services direct to consumers enabling them to proactively manage their credit health and safeguard against identity theft. The Company is the market leader for credit information services in North America. Equifax Inc.s 2001 financial reporting was significantly impacted by the spin off of its Payment Services business ("Certegy"), divestitures of non core businesses ("Divested Operations"), and restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. Excluding these transactions, Equifax reported record revenues, earnings and cash flow for its core business, largely attributable to performance in its North American Information Services businesses. Significant 2001 financial highlights were: Consolidated revenues increased 8% to $1.1 billion. Diluted earnings per share increased 5% to $1.15, before restructuring and other charges of $60 million (pre tax). Consolidated operating margins were 29%. North American revenues increased 13% and operating income increased 14%. U.S. consumer reporting volumes grew 20%. The Consumer Direct business more than tripled revenues. Free cash flow grew to $208 million, a 72% increase over 2000. Significant Transactions On July 7, 2001, Equifax completed the spin off of Certegy into a separate, publicly traded company. The spin off permitted both companies to focus on growth in their core businesses with dedicated resources, and the continued creation of shareholder value. As a result of the spin off, the Companys financial statements have been prepared with Certegys net assets, results of operations and cash flows classified as "discontinued operations," with all historical financial statements restated to conform to this presentation. In October 2001, the Company divested its City Directory business and, in the fourth quarter of 2000, sold its global risk management and U.K. vehicle information businesses. Combined revenues for these businesses in 2001 and 2000 were $29 million and $162 million, respectively, with a 2001 operating loss of $3.6 million and 2000 operating income of $9.0 million. The operating results of these businesses are classified in Divested Operations for segment reporting purposes. In the fourth quarter of 2001, restructuring and other charges were recorded in connection with efforts to properly size and configure our post spin business and to align our cost structure in our international operations. The charge totaled $60 million ($35 million after tax or $0.25 per diluted share) and consisted of approximately $37 million for employee severance and facilities consolidation and $23 million to write down several technology investments. 8 Financial Results The following table summarizes Equifaxs Core Business and As Reported results from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. Core Business As Reported (In millions, except per share) 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 1999 Revenue $1,109.8 $1,027.2 $917.0 $1,139.0 $1,189.2 $1,092.7 Operating income $ 317.8 $ 299.6 $267.4 $ 253.8 $ 308.6 $ 286.3 Other income (expense), net $ 4.7 $ 11.1 $ 11.0 $ (1.2) $ 3.7 $ 10.8 Interest expense $ (47.8) $ (48.3) $(32.9) $ (47.8) $ (55.8) $ (42.2) Income from continuing operations $ 159.7 $ 150.2 $140.1 $ 117.3 $ 141.1 $ 147.7 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.15 $ 1.10 $ 1.00 $ 0.84 $ 1.04 $ 1.06 Management believes the Core Business results are more useful in analyzing the underlying business by providing a consistent comparison of the Companys historical operating performance. Adjustments to reconcile the As Reported results for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 to the Core Business results and the associated impact on diluted earnings per share are as follows: Exclude the operating results and disposition gains and losses of Divested Operations Exclude the 2001 restructuring and other charges Adjust other income and interest expense to reflect the impact of the proceeds from Divested Operations Adjust the effective income tax rate, which reflects the above adjustments See Exhibit 99.8 to this report for a more detailed analysis of the reconciling adjustments for Core Business results of operations. Earnings Per Share (Diluted): 2001 2000 1999 Continuing operations, As Reported $0.84 $1.04 $ 1.06 Adjustments: Exclude the 2001 restructuring and other charges 0.25 Adjust for the impacts of Divested Operations 0.05 0.03 (0.05) Adjust income taxes 0.04 (0.01) Continuing operations, Core Business $1.15 $1.10 $ 1.00 The following discussion of revenue, operating income, and segment results is on a Core Business basis (as previously described). The discussion of other income (expense), net, interest expense, and effective tax rates is on an As Reported basis. Revenue Revenues of $1.1 billion in 2001 increased 8% over 2000, driven by our North American Information Services segments record consumer credit reporting volumes and growth in our Consumer Direct business. In 2001, North America accounted for 77% of the Companys total revenue and 90% of the operating income before corporate expense. Revenue growth in North America was 13%. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, particularly in Latin America, negatively impacted revenue $27 million or 3%. Incremental revenues from our acquisitions in 2000 positively impacted revenue growth approximately 4%. Revenues of $1.0 billion in 2000 increased 12% over 1999. Revenue growth was significantly influenced by the May 2000 acquisition of our Direct Marketing Services business, formerly the Consumer Information Solutions Group ("CIS") from R.L. Polk & Co. Excluding the impact of the CIS acquisition, revenue growth was 3%. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies during 2000, particularly the British pound and Spanish peseta, reduced 2000 revenue by approximately $15 million or 2%. 9 Operating Income Operating income in 2001 increased 6% to $317.8 million on operating margins of 29%. North Americas operating income growth of 14% and 40 basis point margin improvement driven by consumer reporting and Consumer Direct offset margin deterioration in our international operations, particularly in Europe. Operating income in 2000 grew 12% to $299.6 million with operating margins of 29%. Excluding the CIS acquisition, profit growth was 7%. Operating income growth in our traditional U.S. credit marketing services business, Canadas consumer reporting business and improved operating expenses drove 2000 performance. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net includes interest income on cash balances of $3.2 million in 2001, $7.5 million in 2000, and $5.8 million in 1999. Lower cash balances in foreign operations combined with lower interest rates accounted for the decline in 2001. Other income (expense), net in 2001 and 2000 includes losses associated with the disposition of Divested Operations. In October 2001, the Company sold its City Directory business, which generated a pre tax loss of $5.8 million. The sale of the risk management and vehicle information businesses generated pre tax losses of $4.2 million in 2000. In 1999, the Company sold three risk management offices located in the U.S. that resulted in a pre tax gain of $4.1 million. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $8.0 million in 2001 and increased $13.6 million in 2000, as compared with prior years. The decrease in 2001 from 2000 was due to lower average debt outstanding and lower effective borrowing rates. The increase in 2000 resulted from higher average debt outstanding associated with 2000 acquisition activity and 1999 treasury stock purchases. After adjusting for the $275 million debt reduction related to the spin off of Certegy, average total debt outstanding was $775.4 million in 2001, $824.8 million in 2000 and $699.0 million in 1999. Effective Tax Rates The effective tax rates from continuing operations were 42.1%, 43.4% and 40.3% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Changes in the levels of non deductible goodwill associated with divestitures and in the levels of foreign earnings accounted for the changes in effective tax rates between periods. The effective rate in 2002 is expected to decline to approximately 40%, due to the elimination of goodwill amortization and the effects of tax planning strategies. Segment Results The following table summarizes the segment results for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. The results of businesses sold in October 2001 and in the fourth quarter of 2000 are classified as Divested Operations. The Companys previous Consumer Information Services segment results are now reported in the North American Information Services segment. Revenue Operating Income (Loss) (In millions) 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 1999 North American Information Services $ 852.4 $ 755.2 $ 633.1 $327.5 $287.2 $261.0 Equifax Europe 141.1 142.9 148.7 1.8 13.7 4.7 Equifax Latin America 106.7 119.5 125.5 24.4 31.5 28.8 Other 9.6 9.6 9.6 8.9 8.9 8.9 General Corporate Expense (44.8) (41.7) (36.0) Core Business 1,109.8 1,027.2 917.0 317.8 299.6 267.4 Divested Operations 29.2 162.0 175.7 (3.6) 9.0 18.9 Restructuring and Other Charges (Note 5) (60.4) As Reported $1,139.0 $1,189.2 $1,092.7 $253.8 $308.6 $286.3 10 North American Information Services North American Information Services accounted for $852.4 million, or 77% of the Companys revenues in 2001 and $327.5 million, or 90% of the operating income, before corporate expense. This segment includes U.S. Credit Information Services, Mortgage Services, Credit Marketing Services, Direct Marketing Services, Canadian Operations and Consumer Direct. Segment revenues increased 13% in 2001 and 19% in 2000. Excluding the impact of the May 2000 CIS acquisition, North Americas revenue increased 8% in 2001 and 6% in 2000. U.S. Credit Information Services 2001 revenue increased 13% compared to 1% growth in 2000, with 2001 growth driven by a record credit reporting volume increase of 20%. The key industry growth drivers were: mortgage, telecommunications, financial services and automotive. Lower interest rates helped generate record volumes in mortgage refinancing, cellular usage increased, and automakers zero rate financing incentives drove consolidated volumes with consecutive quarterly growth in 2001. In 2000, volumes increased 11%. Volume growth was partially offset by average unit price declines of 6% in 2001 and 9% in 2000. Average pricing is impacted by mix of business, with many of our large customers driving increased volumes at lower average unit prices. U.S. Credit Information Services compounded annual volume growth since 1990 is approximately 13%. In 2002, we expect volume growth to return to levels more indicative of historical performance. Canadian revenue increased 14% in 2001 on strong consumer credit volume growth compared to almost flat growth in 2000. During 2001, increasing demand for information from mortgage industry customers, caused by a declining interest rate environment, resulted in 73% growth in Mortgage Services revenue to $44.4 million, compared with a 21% decrease in 2000. In 2002, we expect this business to decline from 2001 levels, as refinancing activity moderates. Our Credit Marketing Services and Direct Marketing Services businesses generated combined revenue of $259.3 million, or 2% growth, compared to $253.6 million in 2000. Excluding the Direct Marketing Services incremental revenues of $33.2 million from the May 2000 acquisition, 2001 revenues declined 11% largely due to the economic impact of companies reducing advertising and marketing expenditures. In Credit Marketing Services, which includes pre screening, portfolio review, database and other marketing products, 2001 revenues declined 6% versus a 2000 record year of 28% growth. Lower revenues in 2001 were principally due to product mix shifts to lower priced risk management products, some price compression due to customer consolidation, and fewer marketing campaigns. Our Direct Marketing Services business experienced a 22% sales decline in comparable sales in 2001 versus 2000, principally driven by a significant contraction in advertising and marketing expenditures by its customers due to the slowing U.S. economy. Consumer Direct more than tripled revenues to $21.9 million in 2001 largely due to $10 million of incremental sales from the new ScorePower(TM) credit score product launched in March 2001 and increased sales of the Equifax Credit Profile(R) credit report and Equifax Credit Watch(TM) credit monitoring service. Consumer Direct sales in 2000 totaled $5.5 million. Operating income for North American Information Services increased 14% in 2001 compared to 10% in 2000. Excluding the impact of the CIS acquisition, operating income growth for 2001 and 2000 was 13% and 5%, respectively. Operating margins were 38% in 2001 and 2000, compared to 41% in 1999. Lower margins in 2001 and 2000 are attributable to the Companys investment in its marketing services businesses, Consumer Direct and identity authentication services. Equifax Europe Revenue in Equifax Europe, which consists of operations in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Italy, grew 3% and 4% in 2001 and 2000, respectively, on a local currency basis. The local currency growth in 2001 is attributable to the November 2000 acquisition of SEK in Italy. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Spanish peseta reduced Equifax Europes revenue by approximately $6.0 million in 2001 and $12.5 million in 2000. Operating income in 2001 of $1.8 million declined $11.9 million from 2000 on lower revenues in the United Kingdom and Spain primarily due to slower economic growth. In 2000, operating income improved $9.0 million over 1999, substantially driven by expense reductions. We continue to focus on driving operational efficiencies in our European businesses and expect improved margins in 2002. Equifax Latin America Equifax Latin America generated revenue of $106.7 million and an operating margin of 23% in 2001. The Company has operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Uruguay and El Salvador. In local currency, revenues increased 3% in 2001 while declining 3% in 2000. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso reduced this segments revenue by approximately $17.5 million and $2.3 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. 11 Operating income in 2001 decreased $7.1 million mainly due to weak currencies and economic conditions in the region compared to a $2.7 million increase in 2000. Cost containment measures have helped stabilize and maintain attractive margins of 23% in 2001 and 26% in 2000. This segments operating results will be adversely affected in 2002 by the recent economic events in Argentina. These events have impacted both the conversion rates of the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar and also the general business conditions in Argentina. 2001 revenue and operating income for our business in Argentina totaled $26.0 million and $9.1 million, respectively, and the Companys investment in that business totaled approximately $26 million at December 31, 2001. Other Other consists solely of a subcontract, which expires at the end of May 2002, relating to the Companys lottery subsidiary. Revenue and operating income remained comparable at $9.6 million and $8.9 million, respectively, in all periods. General Corporate General corporate expense in 2001 increased $3.1 million on higher incentive plan expense and increased $5.7 million in 2000 primarily due to higher technology costs and one time expenses associated with our headquarters relocation. Financial Condition Cash provided by operations increased 32% to $255.1 million in 2001, and free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) increased 72% to $208 million. The improvement over 2000 was largely influenced by higher operating income from Core Businesses, aggressive management of receivables (days sales outstanding declined from 75 days in 2000 to 63 days in 2001), and a $24.8 million reduction in capital expenditures. Cash provided by operations in 2000 was $192.8 million. Operating cash flow has been sufficient to fund capital expenditures, dividend payments and scheduled maturities of long term debt. During 2001, the Companys cash used in investing activities totaled $106.5 million compared to $263.0 million in 2000. The Company was less acquisitive in 2001 versus 2000 as its major focus was the spin off of Certegy. Capital expenditures, exclusive of acquisitions and investments, amounted to $47.1 million in 2001 compared to $71.9 million in 2000. Total capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to approximate $50 million. Acquisitions and investments, net of cash acquired, declined from $346.8 million in 2000 to $68.7 million in 2001, largely due to the May 2000 CIS acquisition. Cash proceeds generated from the sale of businesses and other assets amounted to $12.4 million in 2001 and $157.5 million in 2000, and are principally associated with the City Directory sale in 2001 and the sales of our risk management and vehicle information businesses in 2000. In 2001, cash used by financing activities totaled $325.5 million compared to $16.4 million of cash generated in 2000. In 2001, the Company reduced its long term debt $298.9 million through the repayment of borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Debt repayments were funded through operating cash flows and the cash dividend received from Certegy in conjunction with the spin off. During the year, the Company acquired 2.15 million shares of stock at an investment of $49.5 million. Stock repurchases in 2000 amounted to $6.5 million, down from $210.2 million in 1999. The repurchases were temporarily suspended in 2000 to enable the Company to apply available cash to the repayment of debt incurred in connection with the CIS acquisition. At December 31, 2001, the Companys remaining authorization for share repurchases was approximately $45 million, and in February 2002, the Companys Board of Directors approved an additional $250 million for share repurchases. The Company continued its 89 year history of paying dividends, which totaled $32.3 million in 2001. Dividends were $20.0 million lower than 2000 as the Company reduced its quarterly dividend after the Certegy spin off from $0.093 to $0.02 per share. At December 31, 2001, $367.5 million was available to the Company under its new $465 million revolving credit facility. Should CSC exercise its option to sell its credit reporting business to the Company (Note 10), additional sources of financing would be required. However, management believes the Company has sufficiently broad access to the capital markets to enable it to arrange alternative sources of financing. Alternative sources of funding available would include the public debt markets and additional bank lines of credit. Inflation We do not believe that the rate of inflation has had a material effect on our operating results. However, inflation could adversely affect our future operating results if it were to result in a substantial weakening in economic conditions. 12 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect: the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of complexity and warrant specific description. Valuation of Long Lived Assets The Company regularly evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived assets (principally goodwill, purchased data files, systems development and other deferred costs, and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries) may be impaired or not recoverable. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include: changes in business strategy, market conditions, or the manner of use of an asset; underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. In evaluating an asset for possible impairment, management estimates that assets future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, the Company measures the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life. While the Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect these evaluations. In 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which among other things, eliminates the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets and requires that goodwill be evaluated annually for impairment by applying a fair value based test. The Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2002 for acquisitions prior to June 30, 2001, and, in accordance with the standard, will complete its first fair value based impairment tests by June 30, 2002. Deferred Tax Assets The Company estimates levels of future taxable income and utilizes prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in establishing and maintaining deferred tax assets (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). If the Company is unable to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, the Companys effective tax rate could increase. 13 CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The managements discussion and analysis, and other portions of this Form 10 K, include "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward looking statements may include, among others, statements concerning the Companys outlook for 2002, volume and pricing trends, cost control measures and their results, effective income tax rates, the Companys expectations as to funding its capital expenditures and operations, and other statements relative to future plans and strategies. These statements are based on a number of assumptions that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are beyond Equifaxs control. Important factors that either individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: a change in the growth rate of the economies within which the Company conducts business, particularly in the U.S., such that consumer spending and related consumer debt are impacted; a decline or change in the marketing techniques of credit card issuers; unexpected pricing pressures above and beyond the levels experienced in the past; U.S. and international regulatory or legislative changes which may adversely affect the businesses conducted by the Company; successful integration of acquisitions; risks associated with investments and operations in foreign countries, including regulatory environments, exchange rate fluctuations, and local political, social and economic factors; successful development and marketing of new products and services to existing and new industries; protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights; successful incorporation of technological change; control and reduction of cost and expense; interest rate fluctuations; changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions and significant interest rate fluctuations, which may impede the Companys access to, or increase the cost of, external financing; increased competitive pressures both domestically and internationally; and other risks or unforeseen factors including those described below. We depend on our customers requirements for consumer credit information. If these requirements decrease, our business might be adversely affected. Our core product is our consumer credit reports. In general, the usage of credit reports and related services is driven by consumer demand for credit via new credit cards, automobile loans, home mortgages and refinancings and other consumer loans and lenders efforts to develop new, and monitor existing, credit relationships. Consumer demand for credit tends to increase during periods of economic expansion. On the other hand, lenders efforts to monitor existing credit relationships tend to increase during periods of economic contraction. Consequently, revenue from consumer credit information products is influenced by cyclical economic trends related to consumer spending and debt. We rely on demand for consumer information services. Our business might be negatively affected by a decline in demand. We provide value added consumer information services including direct marketing products and services to our traditional customers, as well as to catalog, publishing, high tech, travel and manufacturing clients. Direct marketing products also include data capture, database management, and registration card programs for consumer durable goods manufacturers. In the event that consumers begin to buy fewer of the types of products and services that have in the past been marketed and sold through direct marketing, or if direct marketing loses effectiveness in comparison to other methods of advertising, use of our direct marketing products and services could lessen and, consequently, our revenues and profits could decline. We rely on external data sources. Loss of access to credit and other data from external sources could negatively impact our business. We rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and non proprietary databases, including data received from customers and various government and public record services. The continued availability of such data sources cannot be assured. Although we have no reason to believe that access to current data sources will become restricted, loss of access to, or the availability of, data in the future due to government regulation or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in government regulation could increase our costs or otherwise affect our profits. Our business involves collection of consumer and business data and distribution of such information to businesses making credit and marketing decisions. Consequently, certain of our activities and services are subject to regulation under various federal laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, as well as similar state laws. We are also subject to privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in foreign countries where we do business. 14 We have no reason to believe that additional regulations will be imposed that will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, further federal, state and local data use regulations may affect our operations with increased compliance requirements and potential loss of revenue or decrease in profits. Competition could hurt our business. Equifax operates in a number of geographic, product and service markets, which are highly competitive. We primarily compete with two global consumer credit reporting companies, Experian Information Solutions, Inc. and Trans Union LLC, which offer credit reporting products that are similar to those we offer. We also compete with these and other companies that offer marketing information products and services, including Acxiom Corporation and InfoUSA, Inc. In each of our markets, we compete on the basis of responsiveness to customer needs as well as the quality and range of products and services offered. Although we believe that we offer a broader range of products and services in more geographic markets than our competitors, we face strong competition in certain geographic, product and service markets which, if successful, may have adverse effects on our operations. The above factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward looking statements are illustrative and by no means exhaustive. All forward looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. 15 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. In the normal course of business, the balance sheets and results of operations of the Companys foreign subsidiaries can be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys position is to not hedge translational foreign currency exchange risks. However, the Company does hedge material transactional foreign currency exchange risks, and at December 31, 2001, the exchange risks associated with the Companys intercompany advances to its U.K. operations, as well as the intercompany balances associated with funding its Italy acquisition were hedged by having a portion of the borrowings under its revolving credit facility denominated in those respective currencies. The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by (1) maintaining an appropriate weighted average debt maturity and (2) controlling the mix of fixed and variable rate debt, in part by using interest rate swap agreements. The Companys earnings can be affected by the impact that changes in interest rates have on its variable rate obligations. At December 31, 2001, approximately $358 million (47%) of the Companys short term and long term debt was in variable rate facilities. At this level, if market interest rates increased 1%, interest expense would increase approximately $3.6 million per year (pre tax). 16
