BUSINESS OVERVIEW We are a leading global provider of information solutions, employment and income verification and human resources business process outsourcing services. We leverage one of the largest sources of consumer and commercial data, along with advanced analytics and proprietary technology, to create customized insights which enable our business customers to grow faster and more efficiently and inform and empower consumers. Businesses rely on us for consumer and business credit intelligence, portfolio management, fraud detection, decisioning technology, marketing tools, and human resources and payroll services. We also offer a portfolio of products that enable individual consumers to manage their financial affairs and protect their identity. Our revenue stream is diversified among individual consumers and businesses across a wide range of industries and international geographies. Segment and Geographic Information Segments. The U.S. Consumer Information Solutions, or USCIS, segment, the largest of our five segments, consists of four product and service lines: Online Consumer Information Solutions, Mortgage Reporting Solutions, Credit Marketing Services and Direct Marketing Services. Online Consumer Information Services and Mortgage Reporting Solutions revenue is principally transaction based and is derived from our sales of products such as consumer credit reporting and scoring, mortgage reporting, identity verification, fraud detection and modeling services, and certain of our decisioning products that facilitate and automate a variety of credit oriented decisions, a significant majority of which are delivered electronically. Credit Marketing Services and Direct Marketing Services revenue is principally transaction and subscription based and is derived from our sales of the products such as those that assist clients in acquiring new customers, cross selling to existing customers and managing portfolio risk. The TALX segment consists of The Work Number and Tax and Talent Management business units. The Work Number revenue is transaction based and derived primarily from verification of employment data reported to us by employers. Tax and Talent Management revenues derive from our provision of certain human resources business process outsourcing services that are transaction and subscription based product offerings. North America Personal Solutions revenue is both transaction and subscription based and is derived from the sale of credit monitoring and identity theft protection products, which we deliver to consumers through the mail and electronically via the Internet. North America Commercial Solutions revenue is principally transaction based and is derived from the sale of business information, credit scores and portfolio analytics (decisioning tools) that enable customers to utilize our reports to make financial, marketing and purchasing decisions related to businesses. 29 The International segment consists of Canada Consumer, Europe and Latin America. Canada Consumers products and services are similar to our USCIS offerings, while Europe and Latin America are made up of varying mixes of product lines that are in our USCIS, North America Commercial Solutions and North America Personal Solutions reportable segments. Geographic Information. We currently operate in 14 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Peru, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, Spain, the U.K., Uruguay, and the U.S. Our operations in Costa Rica and the Republic of Ireland focus on data processing and customer support activities. Of the countries we operate in, 73% of our revenue was generated in the U.S. during the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. Key Performance Indicators. Management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor operating and financial performance. These performance indicators include measurements of operating revenue, operating revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share, cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures. The key performance indicators for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, were as follows: Key Performance Indicators Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Operating revenue $ 1,843.0 $ 1,546.3 $ 1,443.4 Operating revenue growth 19 % 7 % 13 % Operating income $ 486.2 $ 436.1 $ 422.0 Operating margin 26.4 % 28.2 % 29.2 % Income from continuing operations $ 272.7 $ 274.5 $ 246.5 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.02 $ 2.12 $ 1.86 Cash provided by operating activities $ 449.9 $ 372.1 $ 337.8 Capital expenditures $ 118.5 $ 52.0 $ 46.2 Operational Highlights. On May 15, 2007, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of TALX, a leading provider of employment and income verification and human resources business process outsourcing services. The acquisition aligns with our long term growth strategy of expanding into new markets with unique data. We achieved double digit revenue growth in our International, North America Personal Solutions and North America Commercial Solutions operating segments when compared with 2006. We repurchased 17.9 million shares of our common stock on the open market for $718.7 million during 2007. On June 28, 2007, we issued $300.0 million principal amount of 6.3%, ten year senior notes and $250.0 million principal amount of 7.0%, thirty year senior notes in underwritten public offerings. Business Environment, Company Outlook and Strategy Our financial condition and operating performance are affected by the rate at which the economies of the U.S. and the other countries in which we operate grow, as well as levels of consumer spending and confidence regarding jobs, the health of the economy and the unemployment rate. Changes in overall economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate generally impact the demand for consumer credit and accordingly for our credit information, marketing services, 30 employment and income information, as well as other products and services. We do not expect meaningful improvement in revenue from our USCIS business in 2008. We do, however, expect our other operating segments to grow revenues when compared to 2007 due to new product innovation, attracting new customers and growing volumes with our existing customers. The demand for our services is influenced by price and service competition among a limited number of providers; investment in proprietary credit information databases; changes in customer requirements; continued consolidation in the lending, credit card and telecommunications industries; emerging new market segments; and technological innovation. To improve our competitive position requires that we continue to focus on developing applications to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors; efficient operational processing to offset price compression; competitive pricing; technological competence; and protection of sensitive data. Other significant factors include brand recognition, customer responsiveness and service quality, ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and regulatory compliance. We expect to be able to respond to these challenges by focusing on these strategic objectives: Increase penetration of our customers information solutions needs through new products, value based pricing, expanded services and improved sales and customer support; Deploy enabling technology systems and analytics globally; Invest in unique data sources; and Pursue new vertical markets and expand into emerging markets. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 Consolidated Financial Results Operating Revenue Change Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Consolidated Operating Revenue 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) U.S. Consumer Information Solutions $ 969.7 $ 968.1 $ 933.3 $ 1.6 0 % $ 34.8 4 % International 472.8 402.8 358.3 70.0 17 % 44.5 12 % North America Personal Solutions 153.5 126.0 114.7 27.5 22 % 11.3 10 % North America Commercial Solutions 67.6 49.4 37.1 18.2 37 % 12.3 33 % TALX 179.4 179.4 nm nm Consolidated operating revenue $ 1,843.0 $ 1,546.3 $ 1,443.4 $ 296.7 19 % $ 102.9 7 % nm not meaningful The 2007 increase in revenue is due to double digit growth in our International, North America Personal Solutions and North America Commercial Solutions segments, as discussed in greater detail in "Segment Financial Results" below, as well as the acquisition of TALX. We recorded $179.4 million in revenue from TALX since our acquisition of the company on May 15, 2007. Revenues from our USCIS segment were essentially flat due to weakness in mortgage, credit marketing and direct marketing markets. The 2006 increase in revenue was due to broad based growth across all of our segments. Foreign currency had a favorable impact of $32.5 million or 2% and $18.5 million or 1%, on 2007 and 2006 revenue growth, respectively. 31 Operating Expenses Change Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Consolidated Operating Expenses 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Consolidated cost of services $ 752.0 $ 626.4 $ 594.2 $ 125.6 20 % $ 32.2 5 % Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses 477.1 401.0 345.0 76.1 19 % 56.0 16 % Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense 127.7 82.8 82.2 44.9 54 % 0.6 1 % Consolidated operating expenses $ 1,356.8 $ 1,110.2 $ 1,021.4 $ 246.6 22 % $ 88.8 9 % nm not meaningful The 2007 increase in cost of services was significantly affected by our acquisition of TALX, which contributed $60.1 million of this increase. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to (1) higher production and related costs due to revenue growth, including costs related to converting a major customer to our enabling technologies; (2) the impact of foreign currency translation; (3) expenditures to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness and reliability of our information technology platforms, processes, and development capabilities in support of our long term growth strategy; and (4) higher salary and contractor staffing costs, partly due to increased call volume and a second outsourced call center related to North America Personal Solutions. The 2006 increases in cost of services were primarily due to operating revenue growth and increased salary expenses due to higher headcount and our annual incentive program. The 2007 increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly due to our acquisition of TALX, which contributed $51.8 million of this increase. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to (1) salary costs related to increased headcount for the expansion of corporate capabilities in key support areas, including marketing and technology; (2) the impact of foreign currency translation; and (3) expenses related to Austin Tetra (which was acquired in October 2006). This increase was partially offset by lower litigation costs. Our 2006 results included a $5.0 million provision for litigation related to our North America Personal Solutions operating segment and a $4.0 million provision for litigation related to our USCIS operating segment accrued in 2006 that did not recur in 2007. The increase was also partially offset by lower advertising expenses related to North America Personal Solutions operating segment due to the elimination of less effective advertising channels. The 2006 increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly due to (1) a $7.6 million incremental negative impact of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 123R, "Share Based Payment," or SFAS 123R, on January 1, 2006; (2) $9.0 million in loss contingencies related to certain pending legal matters noted above; (3) a $6.4 million severance charge recognized during the fourth quarter of 2006 related to our organizational realignment; (4) a $3.2 million negative impact of the retirement of several executive officers in 2006; (5) higher salary expenses due to increased headcount; and (6) increased professional fees. The 2007 increase in depreciation and amortization expense was mainly due to $38.3 million in incremental depreciation and amortization expense related to our acquisition of TALX. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to depreciation expense related to increased 2007 capital expenditures, including the purchase of the facility that houses our Atlanta, Georgia data center on July 26, 2007, and intangible amortization expense related to our acquisitions of Austin Tetra in October 2006 and of three mortgage affiliates in the first quarter of 2007. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2006 remained consistent with the previous year. 32 Operating Income and Operating Margin Change Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Consolidated Operating Income 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Consolidated operating revenue $ 1,843.0 $ 1,546.3 $ 1,443.4 $ 296.7 19 % $ 102.9 7 % Consolidated operating expenses 1,356.8 1,110.2 1,021.4 246.6 22 % 88.8 9 % Consolidated operating income $ 486.2 $ 436.1 $ 422.0 $ 50.1 11 % $ 14.1 3 % Consolidated operating margin 26.4 % 28.2 % 29.2 % nm nm nm nm nm not meaningful The 2007 decline in operating margin was primarily due to declines in the margins of our USCIS business units and the impact of acquisition related amortization expense from our acquisition of TALX. This amortization expense represented 2% of 2007 consolidated revenue. The 2006 decline in operating margin was primarily driven by the loss contingencies related to certain legal matters, the negative incremental impact of adopting SFAS 123R and the charge related to our organizational realignment. Other Expense, Net Change Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Consolidated Other Expense, Net 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Consolidated interest expense $ 58.5 $ 31.9 $ 35.6 $ 26.6 83 % $ (3.7 ) (10 )% Consolidated minority interests in earnings, net of tax 6.1 4.5 4.9 1.6 36 % (0.4 ) (8 )% Consolidated other income, net (3.0 ) (16.2 ) (9.2 ) 13.2 (81 )% (7.0 ) 76 % Consolidated other expense, net $ 61.6 $ 20.2 $ 31.3 $ 41.4 205 % $ (11.1 ) (35 )% Weighted average cost of debt 6.1 % 5.7 % 5.4 % nm nm nm nm Total consolidated debt $ 1,387.3 $ 503.9 $ 556.1 $ 883.4 175 % $ (52.2 ) (9 )% nm not meaningful The 2007 increase in other expense, net, was primarily due to increased interest expense driven by a higher level of debt during 2007 which was used to fund the acquisition of TALX and our share buy back activity in 2007. See Note 4 for additional information about debt agreements initiated or acquired during 2007. The 2006 decrease in other expense, net, was primarily due to a favorable settlement of claims against certain former shareholders of Naviant, Inc. during the third quarter of 2006. In 2004, we served a demand for arbitration, alleging, among other things, that the sellers had breached various representations and warranties concerning information furnished to us in connection with our acquisition of Naviant, Inc. in 2002. As a result of this settlement, we recognized a $14.1 million non taxable gain in other income, net, on our Consolidated Statement of Income in 2006. 33 Income Taxes Change Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Consolidated Provision for Income Taxes 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Consolidated provision for income taxes $ 151.9 $ 141.4 $ 144.2 $ 10.5 7 % $ (2.8 ) (2 )% Effective income tax rate 35.8 % 34.0 % 36.9 % nm nm nm nm nm not meaningful The 2007 increase in our effective income tax rate and the related provision for income taxes was primarily due to changes in several tax reserves in 2006, described below, that did not recur in 2007. This increase was partially offset by a lower foreign and state tax rate compared to 2006; a favorable second quarter 2007 discrete item related to our foreign tax credit utilization; and discrete items recorded during fourth quarter 2007, including a $2.9 million benefit for refunds related to our 2002 and 2003 U.S. federal income tax filings. The 2006 decrease in our effective income tax rate and the related provision for income taxes was due primarily to the reversal of $9.5 million in income tax reserves related to uncertain tax positions for which the applicable statute of limitations expired in the third quarter of 2006 and the $14.1 million non taxable gain on the litigation settlement associated with Naviant, Inc. during the second quarter of 2006, offset by an increase in foreign tax expense during 2006. Net Income Change Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Consolidated Net Income 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Consolidated net income $ 272.7 $ 274.5 $ 246.5 $ (1.8 ) (1 )% $ 28.0 11 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 2.02 $ 2.12 $ 1.86 $ (0.10 ) (5 )% $ 0.26 14 % Weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share 135.1 129.4 132.2 nm nm nm nm nm not meaningful Our 2007 decline in net income was a function of growth in operating income from our International, North America Personal Solutions and North America Commercial Solutions segments, when compared to 2006, and from the acquisition of TALX, more than offset by increased interest expense and a higher provision for income taxes. Our 2006 increase in net income was primarily due to growth in operating income from all four of our operating segments, as well as the reversal of a $9.5 million tax reserve related to uncertain tax positions for which the applicable statute of limitations expired in the third quarter of 2006. Our 2007 earnings per share was negatively impacted by the increase in our weighted average shares outstanding resulting from our issuance of common stock in connection with the TALX acquisition, partially offset by the impact of share repurchases completed after the acquisition in May 2007. Our 2006 earnings per share were positively impacted by growth in net income and share repurchases over the course of that year when compared with 2005. 34 Segment Financial Results U.S. Consumer Information Solutions Change Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 U.S. Consumer Information Services 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Operating revenue: Online Consumer Information Solutions $ 639.0 $ 619.2 $ 594.5 $ 19.8 3 % $ 24.7 4 % Mortgage Reporting Solutions 66.1 71.7 85.1 (5.6 ) (8 )% (13.4 ) (16 )% Credit Marketing Services 156.4 166.3 150.7 (9.9 ) (6 )% 15.6 10 % Direct Marketing Services 108.2 110.9 103.0 (2.7 ) (2 )% 7.9 8 % Total operating revenue $ 969.7 $ 968.1 $ 933.3 $ 1.6 0 % $ 34.8 4 % % of Consolidated Revenue 53 % 63 % 64 % nm nm nm nm Total operating income $ 383.5 $ 395.7 $ 392.2 $ (12.2 ) (3 )% $ 3.5 1 % Operating margin 39.6 % 40.9 % 42.0 % nm (1.3 )% nm (1.1 )% nm not meaningful The small increase in 2007 revenue was due to growth in Online Consumer Information Solutions being largely offset by decreased revenues in the other three business units due primarily to weakness in the U.S. credit and mortgage markets. The 2006 increase in revenue was primarily due to growth in 3 of the 4 business units, offset partially be decreased revenues in Mortgage Reporting Solutions. Online Consumer Information Solutions The 2007 increase in revenue was primarily due to volume increases from our regional customers and both volume and price increases from our smaller customers. Revenue from resellers also rose during 2007 due to price increases that became effective near the end of 2006, and we recorded higher revenue from our insurance, banking and regulatory brokerage monitoring customers. These increases were partially offset by price and volume decreases from certain large financial services institutions. The 2006 increase in revenue was primarily due to higher sales volume to our financial services customers, which offset some decline in telecommunication accounts and price compression. Online transaction volume in this business unit was approximately 690 million, 650 million and 610 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Mortgage Reporting Solutions The 2007 decline in revenue is primarily a result of weakness in the U.S. mortgage markets, which led to reduced transaction volumes from our existing customer base and caused several large mortgage brokerage customers to cease operations during 2007. This decrease was partially offset by incremental revenue from our acquisition of three mortgage affiliates in the first quarter of 2007 and increased revenue related to our recently introduced settlement services products. The 2006 decrease in revenue was primarily due to volume declines from a large customer that changed its retail mortgage business model, as well as less favorable mortgage market conditions, including higher interest rates that resulted in lower refinancing and mortgage origination activity. Credit Marketing Services The 2007 decrease in revenue was primarily due to a decline in prescreen transaction volume and analysis services from our large financial services, telecommunications and reseller customers. This decrease was partially offset by increased prescreen transaction volumes for our smaller customers. Our financial services customers increased portfolio review product volumes, which reflects a continuing 35 trend towards the enhanced management of their existing customer portfolios as opposed to new account acquisitions. The 2006 increase in revenue was primarily due to higher volume mainly from national and regional customers for certain of our products that target new customers and our account management product offerings, as well as continued demand for core prescreen products and data sales. Direct Marketing Services The 2007 decrease in revenue was mainly due to reduced mailing volumes from our existing customer base, driven in part by the increase in postage rates. This decrease was partially offset by increased revenue from new and renewed contracts to provide services related to our customers marketing databases. The 2006 increase in revenue was mainly due to higher volume from existing customers and revenue from new customers and products. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions Operating Margin The 2007 decline in operating margin was primarily a result of the fixed cost nature of the USCIS business in the midst of revenue declines in our Mortgage Reporting Solutions, Credit Marketing Services and Direct Marketing Services business units. While revenue of the entire USCIS business was essentially flat, the operating expense of maintaining the databases, products, and customer support capabilities required for the business increased by 2.4%, reflecting annual compensation increases and enhanced product, processing and support capabilities. Recognizing the low expectations for growth in this business in 2008, given current economic conditions, management has taken and is continuing to take steps to streamline operations and increase efficiency in order to protect operating margins. The 2006 decline in operating margin was primarily driven by changes in business mix which resulted in price compression; increased sales tax and legal expenses; higher technology and fulfillment related costs; and the $4.0 million, pretax, loss contingency related to litigation loss contingency recorded in the third quarter of 2006.

Local currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted our International revenue by $31.0 million, or 7%, in 2007 and $17.1 million, or 5%, in 2006. Revenue was up 10% in local currency in 2007 and 7% in 2006. 36  Europe The 2007 increase in revenue was mainly attributable to our consumer risk products, with volume increases in the U.K. and new customers and pricing management strategies in Spain and Portugal. Local currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted our European revenue by $14.6 million, or 10%, as revenue was up 10% in local currency. The 2006 increase in revenue was primarily due to higher consumer information services activity associated with new business and increased volumes from existing customers, as well as increased volumes related to our commercial services business. Local currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted our European revenue by $2.2 million, or 1%, as revenue was up 7% in local currency. Latin America The 2007 increase in revenue was driven by double digit sales growth in 6 of the 7 country markets in which we operate, primarily due to higher volumes of our online solutions, enabling technologies and marketing products. This was partially offset by weaker performance, in local currency, from Brazil due to increased competition, as volumes from small and medium sized customers declined. Local currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted our Latin America revenue by $10.2 million, or 7%, as revenue grew 12% in local currency in 2007. The 2006 increase was primarily due to broad based pricing increases in core information products, higher pricing for high value products, new product introductions and favorable foreign currency impact. Six country markets in Latin America experienced double digit revenue growth in U.S. dollars in 2006 and 5 of the 7 country markets had double digit growth in local currency. Local currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted our Latin America revenue by $8.9 million, or 7%, as revenue grew 14% in local currency in 2006. Canada Consumer The 2007 increase in revenue was primarily driven by price and volume increases for our consumer risk products, as well as increased volumes for marketing products. Local currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted our Canada Consumer revenue by $6.1 million, or 6%, as revenue grew 6% in local currency in 2007. The 2006 increase in revenue was primarily due to the impacts of favorable currency fluctuations. Local currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted our Canada Consumer revenue by $6.0 million, or 6%, as revenue growth was flat in local currency in 2006. International Operating Margin The 2007 increase in operating margin was primarily driven by revenue growth, partially offset by higher production costs and increased salary costs due to additional headcount as we invest for international growth. The increase in production costs was impacted by certain vendor price reductions received by our European business during 2006 that did not recur in 2007. We also invested in our Canada Consumer business for mainframe and data center improvements. The 2006 increase in operating margin was primarily driven by higher pricing for selected high value products in Latin America, and higher sales volume and continued focus on controlling expenses, including certain vendor price reductions received during the six months ended June 30, 2006 in Europe. These increases were partially offset by higher production costs from rising sales volumes related to our consumer and commercial businesses and increased investment in the business in Europe. 37 North America Personal Solutions Change Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 North America Personal Solutions 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Total operating revenue $ 153.5 $ 126.0 $ 114.7 $ 27.5 22 % $ 11.3 10 % % of Consolidated Revenue 8 % 8 % 8 % nm nm nm nm Total operating income $ 34.0 $ 13.6 $ 13.5 $ 20.4 150 % $ 0.1 1 % Operating margin 22.1 % 10.8 % 11.8 % nm 11.3 % nm (1.0 )% nm not meaningful The 2007 increase in revenue was primarily due to higher subscription revenue associated with our 3 in 1 Monitoring, Credit Watch and ScoreWatch products. Subscription customers grew to 1.4 million in 2007, up from 1.0 million in 2006. This increase was partially offset by declining transactional revenue associated with our Credit Profiles, Score Power and Credit Rankings products. The 2006 increase in revenue was primarily due to higher revenue related to subscription based products as we worked to transition from a transaction based product mix to subscription based products. During 2007 and 2006, we also increased revenues through targeted advertising, improvement in the conversion of inquiries to sales, and growth in services provided in third party data breaches. The 2007 increase in operating margin was mainly due to continued subscription based revenue growth, the 2006 $5.0 million operating expense impact of legal contingencies that did not recur in 2007, and decreased advertising expense due to a reduction in radio advertising when compared with 2006. This improvement was partially offset by higher personnel and training costs due to higher call center volumes and the addition of a second outsourced call center in 2007. The 2006 decrease in operating margin was mainly due to volume related costs and the recognition of $5.0 million in pretax loss contingencies related to certain legal matters, largely offset by growth from increased subscription based revenue.

Of the 37% and 33% revenue growth in 2007 and 2006, respectively, Austin Tetra contributed 14% and 8% and Canada currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted revenue by 3% and 4%, or $1.5 million in each year. The remaining 20% and 21% of revenue growth in 2007 and 2006, respectively, was due to organic growth within our legacy North America Commercial Solutions product offerings. Online transaction volume for our commercial credit information products was 4.7 million in 2007, up from 3.6 million in 2006. 38 The 2007 decrease in operating margin was primarily attributable to increased volume related costs and our investing for future growth in this segment, including higher salary costs in 2007 due to additional headcount. The 2006 increase in operating margin was primarily due to growth driven by overall volume growth and improved operating leverage. TALX Change Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2007 vs. 2006 TALX 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Operating Revenue: The Work Number $ 72.6 $ $ $ 72.6 nm nm nm Tax and Talent Management 106.8 106.8 nm nm nm Total operating revenue $ 179.4 $ $ $ 179.4 nm nm nm % of Consolidated Revenue 10 % nm nm nm nm nm nm Total operating income $ 29.3 $ $ $ 29.3 nm nm nm Operating margin 16.3 % nm nm nm nm nm nm nm not meaningful The results of TALXs operations are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on May 15, 2007. TALX generated $179.4 million in revenue from May 15, 2007 through December 31, 2007. Of this amount, The Work Number business represented $72.6 million in revenue, or 40% of total TALX revenue, while the Tax and Talent Management business generated 60%, or $106.8 million in revenue. Operating margin was 16.3% for the period. TALX acquisition related amortization expense was $34.0 million for the period, or 19% of revenue, which negatively impacted operating margin. General Corporate Expense Change Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 General Corporate Expense 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) General corporate expense $ 113.7 $ 101.2 $ 88.9 $ 12.5 12 % $ 12.3 14 % nm not meaningful Our general corporate expenses are costs that are incurred at the corporate level and are not directly associated with activities of a particular operating segment. These expenses include shared services, administrative, legal and equity compensation costs. The 2007 increase in general corporate expense was primarily driven by our acquisition of TALX; higher costs of litigation; expansion of corporate capabilities in key support areas, including marketing; and expenditures to enhance certain technology processes and development capabilities, to support continued long term growth and operating efficiency. The 2006 increase in general corporate expense was primarily driven by the $7.6 million incremental negative impact from our adoption of SFAS 123R; the $6.4 million severance charge related to the organizational realignment; the $3.2 million negative impact from the retirement of two executive officers during 2006; plus normal growth in ongoing corporate expenses due to inflation. The 2006 increase was partially offset by higher salary and incentive costs during 2005 related to our transition to a new chief executive officer. 39 LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Our ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. This allows us to fund various investment opportunities, reduce existing debt balances, and increase value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In the event additional liquidity needs arise, we may raise funds from a combination of sources, including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities. Sources and Uses of Cash Our principal sources of funds are cash provided by operating activities and various financing programs, including our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. We believe that these sources will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled debt payments, interest payments, benefit plan contributions, income tax obligations, dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases and any acquisitions, for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. Information about our cash flows, by category, is presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Change Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Net cash provided by (used in): 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Operating activities $ 449.9 $ 372.1 $ 337.8 $ 77.8 21 % $ 34.3 10 % Investing activities $ (422.3 ) $ (86.8 ) $ (157.9 ) $ (335.5 ) nm $ 71.1 nm Financing activities $ (17.6 ) $ (255.0 ) $ (193.5 ) $ 237.4 nm $ (61.5 ) nm nm not meaningful The 2007 increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to incremental income from our TALX acquisition, revenue growth in our existing businesses, and positive changes in our working capital, partially offset by increased interest payments. The 2006 increase was primarily due to the $28.0 million increase in net income. Fund Transfer Limitations. The ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited, in some cases, by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments, which do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness, meet our current obligations or pay dividends. Capital Expenditures Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Net cash used in: 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in millions) Capital expenditures $ 118.5 $ 52.0 $ 46.2 $ 66.5 $ 5.8 Our capital expenditures are used for developing, enhancing and deploying new and existing software in support of our expanding product set, replacing or adding equipment, updating systems for regulatory compliance, the licensing of software applications and investing in system reliability, security and disaster recovery enhancements. During 2007, our capital expenditures increased due to the purchase of the facility which houses our Atlanta, Georgia data center. We expect capital expenditures in 2008 to be within a range of $125.0 million to $150.0 million. 40 Acquisitions Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Net cash used in: 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in millions) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired $ 300.0 $ 34.4 $ 121.8 $ 265.6 $ (87.4 ) TALX Acquisition. On May 15, 2007, we acquired all the outstanding shares of TALX. Under the terms of the transaction, we issued 20.6 million shares of Equifax treasury stock and 1.9 million fully vested options to purchase Equifax common stock, and paid approximately $288.1 million in cash, net of cash acquired. We also assumed TALXs outstanding debt, which had a fair value totaling $177.6 million at May 15, 2007. We financed the cash portion of the acquisition and $96.6 million outstanding on the TALX revolving credit facility at the date of acquisition initially with borrowings under our $850.0 million senior unsecured credit facility, which we refer to as the Senior Credit Facility, and subsequently refinanced this debt in the second quarter of 2007 with ten and thirty year notes. Subsequent to the date of the acquisition, we paid $4.1 million to the former owners of a company purchased by TALX pursuant to an earn out agreement. Acquisition of Credit Reporting Business. On October 19, 2007, in order to continue to grow our credit data business, our Peruvian subsidiary purchased 100% of the stock of a credit reporting business located in Peru for cash consideration of approximately $8.0 million. Austin Tetra Acquisition. On October 6, 2006, we acquired Austin Consolidated Holdings, Inc., known as Austin Tetra, for $34.4 million in cash. Austin Tetra is a provider of business to business data management and enhancement services to the commercial market. 2005 Acquisitions. In March 2005, we acquired APPRO Systems, Inc. to broaden and further strengthen our enabling technologies capabilities in our USCIS business. Additionally, in August 2005, we acquired BeNow to enhance our USCIS business and add to our enabling technology capabilities. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, in order to continue to grow our credit data franchise, we also acquired the credit files, contractual rights to territories and customer relationships and related businesses of two independent credit reporting agencies in the U.S. and one in Canada that housed consumer information on our system. We acquired all of these businesses for $121.8 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and the issuance of 0.4 million shares of Equifax treasury stock. For additional information about our acquisitions, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Borrowings and Credit Facility Availability Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Net cash provided by (used in): 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in millions) Net short term borrowings (repayments) $ 139.7 $ (12.2 ) $ 92.3 $ 151.9 $ (104.5 ) Net borrowings (repayments) under long term revolving credit facilities $ 253.4 $ (40.0 ) $ 65.0 $ 293.4 $ (105.0 ) Payments on long term debt $ (250.0 ) $ $ (250.0 ) $ (250.0 ) $ 250.0 Proceeds from issuance of long term debt $ 545.7 $ $ $ 545.7 $ Net short term borrowings during 2007 represents activity under our $850.0 million commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our Senior Credit Facility, partially offset by net repayments under our trade receivables backed revolving credit facility, which expired on November 29, 2007. We elected not to renew this credit facility upon its expiration. At December 31, 2007, $219.5 million in 41 commercial paper notes was outstanding, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% per annum, all with maturities of less than 90 days. The 2006 and 2005 net short term (repayments) borrowings represent activity under our trade receivables backed revolving credit facility. Net borrowings (repayments) under long term revolving credit facilities during 2007, 2006 and 2005 relate to activity on our Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchase programs. The Senior Credit Facility expires in July 2011. During the second quarter of 2007, we amended our Senior Credit Facility to increase the borrowing limit from $500.0 million to $850.0 million. Among other provisions, the applicable interest margin for borrowings and the annual facility fee were lowered, the maximum leverage ratio (as defined in the amended credit agreement) was increased from 3.0 to 1 to 3.5 to 1, the minimum interest coverage ratio covenant was deleted, and the limit on restricted payments was amended. At December 31, 2007, interest was payable on borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility at the base rate or London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a specified margin or competitive bid option as selected by us from time to time. The annual facility fee and interest rate are subject to adjustment based on our debt ratings. As of December 31, 2007, $255.5 million was available for borrowings and there were outstanding borrowings of $375.0 million under this facility, which is included in long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. On June 28, 2007, we issued $300.0 million principal amount of 6.3%, ten year senior notes and $250.0 million principal amount of 7.0%, thirty year senior notes, which we refer to collectively as the Notes, in underwritten public offerings. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to reduce the amount outstanding in our commercial paper program. In conjunction with the sale of the Notes, we entered into cash flow hedges on $200.0 million and $250.0 million notional amount, respectively, of ten year and thirty year Treasury notes. These hedges were settled in cash on June 25 and 26, 2007, respectively, the date the Notes were sold, requiring a cash payment by us of $1.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively. We refinanced the $250.0 million principal amount relating to our 4.95% notes in November 2007 using our Senior Credit Facility. There were no material payments on long term debt during 2006. We redeemed the $250.0 million principal amount relating to our 6.3% senior unsecured notes in 2005 by utilizing borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities. We are a party to a credit agreement with a Canadian bank that provides for a 10.0 million Canadian dollar, 364 day revolving credit agreement. During the fourth quarter, we elected to reduce the borrowing amount from 25.0 million Canadian dollars to 10.0 million Canadian dollars and extend the maturity date to November 2008. At December 31, 2007, there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility. At December 31, 2007, 57% of our debt was fixed rate debt and 43% was variable rate debt. Our variable rate debt consists of the Senior Credit Facility and commercial paper program and generally bears interest based on a specified margin plus a base rate, LIBOR or commercial paper rate. The interest rates reset periodically, depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements. At December 31, 2007, interest rates on substantially all of our variable rate debt ranged from 5.1% to 5.2%. We were in compliance with all of our financial and non financial debt covenants at December 31, 2007. On February 15, 2007, Standard & Poors Corporation, or S&P, downgraded our senior unsecured long term fixed debt rating from A to BBB+ in reaction to our public announcement of the agreement to acquire TALX and an additional $400.0 million share repurchase program, due to its stated belief that the acquisition reflects a somewhat more aggressive financial policy and more leveraged financial profile. S&Ps rating outlook remained stable. On February 16, 2007, Moodys 42 Investors Service, or Moodys, changed our rating outlook to stable from positive but maintained its Baa1 rating on our senior unsecured long term fixed debt. As of December 31, 2007, our ratings with S&P and Moodys remain unchanged from those announced in February 2007. For additional information about our debt, including the terms of our financing arrangements, basis for variable interest rates and debt covenants, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Equity Transactions Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Net cash provided by (used in): 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in millions) Treasury stock repurchases $ (718.7 ) $ (215.2 ) $ (144.0 ) $ (503.5 ) $ (71.2 ) Dividends paid $ (20.7 ) $ (20.3 ) $ (20.2 ) $ (0.4 ) $ (0.1 ) Proceeds from exercise of stock options $ 31.6 $ 26.1 $ 62.8 $ 5.5 $ (36.7 ) Excess tax benefits from stock based compensation plans $ 7.0 $ 7.2 $ $ (0.2 ) $ 7.2 Sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Under share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors, we purchased 17.9 million, 6.0 million and 4.2 million common shares on the open market during the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, for $718.7 million, $212.7 million and $144.0 million, respectively, at an average price per common share of $40.12, $35.64 and $34.45, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we paid cash dividends of $20.7 million, $20.3 million and $20.2 million, respectively, at $0.16 per share, $0.16 per share and $0.15 per share, respectively. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2007. The table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time. Some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table. Payments due by Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years Thereafter (Dollars in millions) Debt(1) $ 1,384.2 $ 222.1 $ 20.1 $ 409.5 $ 732.5 Operating leases(2) 142.3 22.7 37.9 23.5 58.2 Data processing, outsourcing agreements and other purchase obligations(3) 305.5 88.5 103.3 90.2 23.5 Other long term liabilities(4)(6) 79.8 6.1 14.5 8.3 50.9 Interest payments(5) 1,020.6 82.6 142.1 119.0 676.9 $ 2,932.4 $ 422.0 $ 317.9 $ 650.5 $ 1,542.0 (1)The amounts are gross of unamortized discounts totaling $2.2 million and a purchase accounting fair value adjustment of $5.3 million at December 31, 2007. Total debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is net of the unamortized discounts and fair value adjustment. 43 (2)Our operating lease obligations principally involve office space and equipment, which includes the lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in 2010 and the ground lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in 2048. (3)These agreements primarily represent our minimum contractual obligations for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions, and certain administrative functions. These agreements expire between 2008 and 2014. (4)These long term liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension, postretirement and other compensation related plans, some of which are discounted in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. We made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments. In the table, we have not included amounts related to future pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions, as such required funding amounts have not been determined. (5)For future interest payments on related variable rate debt, which is generally based on LIBOR or commercial paper plus a specified margin, we used the variable rate in effect at December 31, 2007 to calculate these payments. The variable portion of the rate at December 31, 2007 (excluding the margin and facility fees) was between 5.1% and 5.2% for substantially all of our variable rate debt. Future interest payments related to our $850.0 million revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program are based on the borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2007 through their respective maturity dates, assuming such borrowings are outstanding until that time. Future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity under this revolving credit facility. (6)This table excludes $37.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. A potential significant future use of cash would be the payment to Computer Sciences Corporation, or CSC, if it were to exercise its option to sell its credit reporting business to us at any time prior to 2013. The option exercise price would be determined by agreement or by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option. We estimate that if the option had been exercised at December 31, 2007, the price range would have been approximately $650.0 million to $725.0 million. This estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business, current market conditions and other factors, all of which are subject to constant change. Therefore, the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than our estimate. Our agreement with CSC, which expires on July 31, 2018, also provides us with an option to purchase its credit reporting business if it does not elect to renew the agreement or if there is a change in control of CSC while the agreement is in effect. If CSC were to exercise its option, or if we were able to and decided to exercise our option, then we would have to obtain additional sources of funding. We believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the capital markets for debt and or equity financing. However, the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors, including credit market conditions, the state of the equity markets, general economic conditions, our credit ratings and our financial performance and condition. Off Balance Sheet Transactions Other than facility leasing arrangements, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. In 1998, we entered into a synthetic lease on our Atlanta corporate headquarters building in order to obtain favorable financing terms with regard to this facility. This $29.0 million lease expires in 2010. Lease payments for the remaining term totaled $4.1 million at December 31, 2007. Under this synthetic lease arrangement, we have guaranteed the residual value of the leased property to the lessor. In the event that the property were to be sold by the lessor at the end of the lease term, we would be responsible for any shortfall of the sales proceeds, up to a maximum amount of $23.2 million, which equals 80% of the value of the property at the beginning of the lease term. The liability for this shortfall, which was $1.9 million and $1.4 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, is recorded in other long term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 44  Letters of Credit and Guarantees We will from time to time issue standby letters of credit, performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business. The aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at December 31, 2007, and all have a maturity of one year or less. Guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units. In connection with the sale of our risk management collections business to RMA Holdings, LLC, or RMA, in October 2000, we guaranteed the operating lease payments of a partnership affiliated with RMA to a lender of the partnership pursuant to a term loan. The operating lease, which expires December 31, 2011, has a remaining balance of $5.3 million, based on the undiscounted value of remaining lease payments, including real estate taxes, at December 31, 2007. On September 12, 2005, RMA sold substantially all of its assets to NCO Group, Inc., or NCO. In conjunction with this sale, NCO agreed to assume the operating lease obligations discussed above, which we will continue to guarantee. We believe that the likelihood of demand for payment by us is minimal and expect no material losses to occur related to this guarantee. Accordingly, we do not have a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2007 or 2006 related to this guarantee. Other Contingencies There are other matters which we are involved in, such as legal proceedings, claims and litigation, for which the final outcome and impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements is uncertain at December 31, 2007. Pension Plans At December 31, 2007, our U.S. Retirement Income Plan, or USRIP, and the Equifax Inc. Pension Plan, or EIPP, met or exceeded ERISAs minimum funding requirements. We do not expect to have to make any minimum funding contributions under ERISA for 2008 with respect to the USRIP or the EIPP, based on applicable law. In January 2006 and 2007, we made discretionary contributions of $20.0 million and $12.0 million, respectively, to the EIPP. We also made a $2.0 million discretionary contribution in 2006 to fund certain other post retirement benefit plans. In the future, we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions, depending on certain circumstances, including market conditions and liquidity needs. For our non U.S., tax qualified retirement plans, we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations. For the non qualified supplementary retirement plans, we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants, but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with GAAP. Related Party Transactions We engage in various transactions and arrangements with related parties. We believe the terms of the transactions and arrangements do not differ from those that would have been negotiated with an independent party. Seasonality We experience seasonalities in certain of our revenue streams. Revenue generated from The Work Number and Tax and Talent Management business units within the TALX operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of Form W 2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year. Revenue from our OCIS and Mortgage Reporting Solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions, most commonly the second and third calendar quarters. 45 Inflation We do not believe that the rate of inflation has had a material effect on our operating results. However, inflation could adversely affect our future operating results. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. In addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Income. We also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results. For additional information about these policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured, the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed. If at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment. If there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. If at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. We have certain information solution offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements. To account for each of these elements separately, the delivered elements must have stand alone value to our customer, and there must exist objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for any undelivered elements. Judgments and uncertainties Each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables. These considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value; concluding when the element will be delivered; and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services. 46 In addition, the determination of certain of our marketing information services revenue requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears. In these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past. Differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported. Effects if actual results differ from assumptions For certain contracts containing multiple elements, the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their relative fair values and to the initial delivered elements using the residual method. If we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate elements for accounting or fair value is not known for any undelivered elements, arrangement consideration may only be recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer. We have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past. We monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future. If we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates, revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future, we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue. Goodwill In accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", or SFAS 142, goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Judgments and uncertainties In analyzing goodwill for potential impairment, we use projections of future discounted cash flows from our reporting units to determine whether the reporting units estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value. These projections of cash flows are based on our views of growth rates, anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values. Our estimates of fair value for each reporting unit are corroborated by market multiple comparables. The use of different estimates or assumptions within our projected discounted cash flows could result in different values and could result in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, a change in our reporting unit structure would result in the requirement to test goodwill for impairment at different reporting units. Effect if actual results differ from assumptions We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. Additionally, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets Indefinite lived intangible assets consist of contractual/territorial rights representing the estimated fair value of rights to operate in certain territories acquired through the purchase of independent credit reporting agencies in the U.S. and Canada. Our contractual/territorial rights are perpetual in nature and, therefore, the useful lives are considered indefinite. In accordance with SFAS 142, we are required 47 to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances change that would indicate the asset might be impaired. Judgments and uncertainties We perform the impairment test for our indefinite lived intangible assets by comparing the assets fair value to its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our contractual/territorial rights based on projected discounted future cash flows. The use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our contractual/territorial rights, or using a methodology other than a discounted cash flow model, could result in different values for our contractual/territorial rights and could result in an impairment charge. The most significant assumptions within our discounted cash flow model are the discount rate, growth rate and charge for contributory assets. Effect if actual results differ from assumptions We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. Additionally, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. Loss Contingencies We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," we determine whether to disclose and or accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable, reasonably possible or remote. Judgments and uncertainties We periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for the estimated settlement costs. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible, but not probable, we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency. Our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective. Effect if actual results differ from assumptions We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies. However, if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates, we may be exposed to a loss that could be material. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," and FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." We record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid. We periodically assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies. To the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable. Our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities. We record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are probable of being sustained under such examinations. Regularly, we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals. 48 Judgments and uncertainties We consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets. These judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income, mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions, and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Effect if actual results differ from assumptions Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material. Pension and Other Postretirement Plans Our pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)," for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. We consider accounting for our U.S. and Canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, which include discount rates, salary growth, expected return on plan assets, interest cost and mortality rates. Judgments and uncertainties We believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are (1) the expected return on plan assets and (2) the discount rate. The expected rate of return on plan assets is primarily based on (1) the expected equity returns based on assumptions such as dividend yield and growth rate, and (2) estimated risk premium for various asset categories. These assumptions are projected using an asset/liability forecasting model, which produces a range and distribution of values for the assumed rate of return. We determine our discount rates primarily based on high quality, fixed income investments and yield to maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments. Effect if actual results differ from assumptions We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material. Adjusting our expected long term rate of return (8.00% at December 31, 2007) by 0.5% would have changed our estimated pension expense in 2007 by approximately $2.7 million. Adjusting our weighted average discount rate (5.86% at December 31, 2007) by 0.5% would have changed our estimated pension expense in 2007 by approximately $2.6 million. Stock Based Compensation We have stock based compensation plans which provide that qualified and non qualified stock options and nonvested stock may be granted to officers and other employees. In accordance with SFAS 123R we recognize the cost of share based payment transactions over the requisite service period. That cost is measured based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. We use the binomial model to calculate the fair value of stock options granted on or after January 1, 2006. The fair value of options granted prior to 2006 was determined using the Black Scholes model. Nonvested stock is valued based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced for expected dividends during the requisite service period. We reassess all assumptions used in calculating fair value each grant date. Judgments and uncertainties The fair value of our stock options is calculated using the binomial model which incorporates assumptions regarding anticipated employee exercise behavior, expected 49 stock price volatility, dividend yield and risk free interest rate. The fair value of nonvested stock is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. However, since our nonvested stock does not pay dividends during the vesting period, the fair value on the date of grant is reduced by the present value of the expected dividends over the requisite service period. SFAS 123R requires us to estimate forfeitures at the grant date. Accordingly, compensation cost is recognized based on the number of awards expected to vest. There may be adjustments in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates. Effect if actual results differ from assumptions We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation that could be material. A 10% change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2007, would have reduced our net income by approximately $1.8 million. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of our business, we are exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, that could impact our results of operations and financial position. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities, and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge certain of these exposures. We use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk A substantial majority of our revenue, expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we do transact business in other currencies, primarily the British pound, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. For most of these foreign currencies, we are a net recipient, and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. We are required to translate, or express in U.S. dollars, the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable year end rate of exchange on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year. We record the resulting translation adjustment, and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a long term investment nature within other comprehensive income, as a component of our shareholders equity. Other immaterial foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We do not, as a matter of policy, hedge translational foreign currency exposure. We may, however, hedge transactional foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency. At December 31, 2007, a 10% weaker U.S. dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2007 would have increased our revenue by $46.1 million and our pre tax operating profit by $14.4 million. At December 31, 2006, a 10% weaker U.S. dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2006 would have increased our revenue by $42.2 million and our pre tax operating profit by $12.8 million. A 10% stronger U.S. dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pre tax operating profit for 2007 and 2006. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variable rate, long term Senior Credit Facility and commercial paper borrowings. We attempt to achieve the lowest all in 50 weighted average cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt, and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt. At December 31, 2007, our weighted average cost of debt was 6.1% and weighted average life of debt was 11.9 years. At December 31, 2007, 57% of our debt was fixed rate, and the remaining 43% was variable rate. Occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps. A 1% change in the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt would not have materially impacted our 2007 net income. Based on and the amount of outstanding variable rate debt, we have material exposure to interest rate risk. In the future, if our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing variable rate credit facilities or new variable rate debt instruments, we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk. The nature and amount of our long term and short term debt, as well as the proportionate amount of fixed rate and variable rate debt, can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. 51
