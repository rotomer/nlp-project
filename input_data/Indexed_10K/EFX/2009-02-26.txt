ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As used herein, the terms Equifax, the Company, we, our and us refer to Equifax Inc., a Georgia corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries as a combined entity, except where it is clear that the terms mean only Equifax Inc. All references to earnings per share data in Managements Discussion and Analysis, or MD&A, are to diluted earnings per share, or EPS, unless otherwise noted. Diluted EPS is calculated to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in additional common shares outstanding. BUSINESS OVERVIEW We are a leading global provider of information solutions, employment and income verification and human resources business process outsourcing services. We leverage some of the largest sources of consumer and commercial data, along with advanced analytics and proprietary technology, to create customized insights which enable our business customers to grow faster, more efficiently, more profitably and to inform and empower consumers. Businesses rely on us for consumer and business credit intelligence, credit portfolio management, fraud detection, decisioning technology, marketing tools, and human resources and payroll services. We also offer a portfolio of products that enable individual consumers to manage their financial affairs and protect their identity. Our revenue stream is diversified among individual consumers and among businesses across a wide range of industries and international geographies. Segment and Geographic Information Segments. The U.S. Consumer Information Solutions, or USCIS, segment, the largest of our five segments, consists of four product and service lines: Online Consumer Information Solutions, or OCIS; Mortgage Solutions; Credit Marketing Services; and Direct Marketing Services. OCIS and Mortgage Solutions revenue is principally transaction based and is derived from our sales of products such as consumer credit reporting and scoring, mortgage settlement services, identity verification, fraud detection and modeling services. USCIS also markets certain of our decisioning products which facilitate and automate a variety of consumer credit oriented decisions. A significant majority of USCIS products are delivered electronically. Credit Marketing Services and Direct Marketing Services revenue is principally project and subscription based and is derived from our sales of batch credit or demographic information such as those that assist clients in acquiring new customers, cross selling to existing customers and managing portfolio risk. The International segment consists of Canada Consumer, Europe and Latin America. Canada Consumers products and services are similar to our USCIS offerings, while Europe and Latin America are made up of varying mixes of product lines that are in our USCIS, North America Commercial Solutions and North America Personal Solutions reportable segments. The TALX segment consists of The Work Number&reg; and Tax and Talent Management business units. The Work Number revenue is transaction based and is derived primarily from verification of employment and income data of employees in the U.S. reported to us by employers. Tax and Talent Management revenues are derived from our provision of certain human resources business process outsourcing services that include both transaction and subscription based product offerings. These services assist our customers with the administration of unemployment claims and employer based tax credits and the assessment of new hires. North America Personal Solutions revenue is both transaction and subscription based and is derived from the sale of credit monitoring and identity theft protection products, which we deliver to consumers through the mail and electronically via the internet. North America Commercial Solutions revenue is principally transaction based and is derived from the sale of business information, credit scores and portfolio analytics that enable customers to utilize our reports to make financial, marketing and purchasing decisions related to businesses. 25 Geographic Information. We currently operate in the following countries: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Peru, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, Spain, the U.K., Uruguay, and the U.S. Our operations in Costa Rica and the Republic of Ireland focus on data processing and customer support activities. During the second quarter of 2008, we expanded into Russia by acquiring an equity interest in a consumer credit information company. Of the countries we operate in, 73% of our revenue was generated in the U.S. during the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. Key Performance Indicators. Management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor operating and financial performance. These performance indicators include measurements of operating revenue, change in operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share, cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures. The key performance indicators for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, were as follows: Key Performance Indicators Twelve Months Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions, except per share data) 2008 2007 2006 Operating revenue $ 1,935.7 $ 1,843.0 $ 1,546.3 Change in operating revenue 5 % 19 % 7 % Operating income $ 477.2 $ 486.2 $ 436.1 Operating margin 24.7 % 26.4 % 28.2 % Net income $ 272.8 $ 272.7 $ 274.5 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.09 $ 2.02 $ 2.12 Cash provided by operating activities $ 444.7 $ 449.9 $ 372.1 Capital expenditures $ 110.5 $ 118.5 $ 52.0 Operational Highlights. Revenue increased five percent to $1.9 billion. EPS for the full year 2008 was $2.09, a four percent increase over $2.02 in 2007. During the third quarter of 2008, we realigned our business to better support our strategic objectives which resulted in $16.8 million of restructuring and asset write down charges ($10.5 million, net of tax). We also recognized a tax benefit of $14.6 million related to uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitations expired. We repurchased 4.5 million shares of our common stock on the open market for $155.7 million during 2008. Our effective tax rate for the full year 2008 was 32.8 percent, down from 35.8 percent in 2007. Total debt was $1.22 billion at December 31, 2008, a decrease of $168 million from December 31, 2007. Business Environment, Company Outlook and Strategy During 2008, the financial markets experienced unprecedented volatility around the world. Many of our customers, especially financial institutions, are encountering much uncertainty, which limits our visibility into their future plans and activities. A number of our customers have reduced their level of activity as a result of continued weakening of the U.S. and U.K. economies in particular. Additionally, there has been more significant activity related to the consolidation of financial institutions, including the recent acquisitions of Wachovia by Wells Fargo, of Countywide Financial by Bank of America and Washington Mutual by JPMorgan Chase. In the past, we have been impacted by industry consolidation. While average core product unit prices tend to decline as a result of consolidation, we look to negotiate higher volumes and capitalize on opportunities to sell additional products and services to offset the decline in prices. However, given significant financial stress impacting financial markets and reduced willingness to extend credit, past experience may or may not continue in the current market. Given the slowing global economic growth and challenging business environment, we continue to focus on our initiatives to reduce and manage our expenses, while trying to preserve our operating margins, earnings performance and cash flows from operations. Also, we continue to realign our resources to pursue key strategic objectives, including new product innovation and international expansion. Based 26 on the uncertainty in the global economy, assuming exchange rates remain at levels consistent with December 31, 2008, we expect revenue in the first quarter of 2009 to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2008. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 Consolidated Financial Results Operating Revenue Operating Revenue Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % U.S. Consumer Information Solutions $ 890.8 $ 969.7 $ 968.1 $ (78.9 ) (8 )% $ 1.6 0 % International 505.7 472.8 402.8 32.9 7 % 70.0 17 % TALX 305.1 179.4 125.7 70 % 179.4 nm North America Personal Solutions 162.6 153.5 126.0 9.1 6 % 27.5 22 % North America Commercial Solutions 71.5 67.6 49.4 3.9 6 % 18.2 37 % Consolidated operating revenue $ 1,935.7 $ 1,843.0 $ 1,546.3 $ 92.7 5 % $ 296.7 19 % nm not meaningful 2008 revenue increased 5%, or $92.7 million, compared to 2007 primarily due to the full year inclusion of TALX, which was acquired on May 15, 2007. Revenue in our four other business units collectively declined by $33.0 million, or two percent, as growth in our International, North America Personal Solutions and North America Commercial Solutions segments through the first nine months of the year was able to partially, but not fully, offset an eight percent decline in our USCIS business. Although the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on 2008 full year revenue growth was minimal, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to 2007 exchange rates negatively impacted fourth quarter revenue growth. If foreign exchange rates remain at levels consistent with December 31, 2008, foreign currency translation would negatively impact expected 2009 revenue growth by approximately four percent. The 2007 increase in revenue, as compared to 2006, is primarily due to $179.4 million of incremental revenue from our acquisition of TALX. Additionally, double digit growth in our International, North America Personal Solutions and North America Commercial Solutions segments also contributed to the increase in revenue, as discussed in greater detail in "Segment Financial Results" below. Foreign currency had a favorable impact on 2007 revenue growth of $32.5 million, or 2%, when using 2006 exchange rates. Operating Expenses Operating Expenses Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Consolidated cost of services $ 778.8 $ 752.0 $ 626.4 $ 26.8 4 % $ 125.6 20 % Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses 524.3 477.1 401.0 47.2 10 % 76.1 19 % Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense 155.4 127.7 82.8 27.7 22 % 44.9 54 % Consolidated operating expenses $ 1,458.5 $ 1,356.8 $ 1,110.2 $ 101.7 8 % $ 246.6 22 % 27 Cost of Services. Cost of services in 2008 increased, as compared to 2007, mainly as a result of our acquisition of TALX, which contributed $38.3 million of incremental cost period over period, as well as increased production and salary costs related to growth in our Latin America operations. These increases were partially offset by declining costs due to decreased revenue and expense efficiency initiatives in USCIS. The 2007 increase in cost of services, as compared to 2006, was significantly affected by our acquisition of TALX, which contributed $60.1 million of this increase. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to (1) higher production and related costs due to revenue growth, including costs related to converting a major customer to our enabling technologies; (2) the impact of foreign currency translation; (3) expenditures to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness and reliability of our information technology platforms, processes, and development capabilities in support of our long term growth strategy; and (4) higher salary and contractor staffing costs, partly due to increased call volume and a second outsourced call center related to North America Personal Solutions. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expense for 2008, as compared to 2007, increased mainly as a result of our acquisition of TALX, which contributed $39.2 million of incremental cost year over year. This increase was also due to a $14.4 million charge recorded in the third quarter of 2008 related to headcount reductions and certain contractual costs. These charges were related to our business realignment to better support our strategic objectives in the current economic environment. These increases were partially offset by reduced personnel costs, incentive expenses and discretionary spending based on actions taken as a response to the deteriorating U.S. economy in 2008. The 2007 increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as compared to 2006, was mainly due to our acquisition of TALX, which contributed $51.8 million of this increase. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to (1) salary costs related to increased headcount for the expansion of corporate capabilities in key support areas, including marketing and technology; (2) the impact of foreign currency translation; and (3) expenses related to Austin Tetra (which was acquired in October 2006). This increase was partially offset by lower litigation costs. Depreciation and Amortization. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of results from our acquisition of TALX, which contributed $24.3 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense in 2008, and a $2.4 million software write down charge recorded in the third quarter of 2008 associated with our business realignment. The 2007 increase in depreciation and amortization expense, as compared to 2006, was mainly due to $38.3 million in incremental depreciation and amortization expense related to our acquisition of TALX. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to higher depreciation expense related to increased capital expenditures in 2007, including the purchase of our data center facility in Atlanta, Georgia in July 2007, and higher intangible amortization expense related to our acquisitions of Austin Tetra in October 2006 and of three mortgage affiliates in the first quarter of 2007. For additional information about the charges and fees related to our business realignment, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. 28 Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating Income and Operating Margin Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Consolidated operating revenue $ 1,935.7 $ 1,843.0 $ 1,546.3 $ 92.7 5 % $ 296.7 19 % Consolidated operating expenses (1,458.5 ) (1,356.8 ) (1,110.2 ) (101.7 ) 8 % (246.6 ) 22 % Consolidated operating income $ 477.2 $ 486.2 $ 436.1 $ (9.0 ) (2 )% $ 50.1 11 % Consolidated operating margin 24.7 % 26.4 % 28.2 % (1.7 ) pts (1.8 ) pts The decline in the operating margin for 2008, as compared to 2007, mainly reflects higher acquisition related amortization expense, which increased $20.9 million primarily due to our acquisition of TALX; the increase in general corporate expense, which includes the $16.8 million restructuring and asset write down charges related to our business realignment recorded in the third quarter of 2008; and the decrease in operating margin for our USCIS business, as described in more detail below. The 2007 decline in operating margin, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to a decline in the margins of our USCIS business unit and the impact of acquisition related amortization expense from our acquisition of TALX. This amortization expense represented 2% of 2007 consolidated revenue. Other Expense, Net Other Expense, Net Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Consolidated interest expense $ 71.3 $ 58.5 $ 31.9 $ 12.8 22 % $ 26.6 83 % Consolidated minority interests in earnings, net of tax 6.2 6.1 4.5 0.1 2 % 1.6 36 % Consolidated other income, net (6.2 ) (3.0 ) (16.2 ) (3.2 ) 106 % 13.2 (81 )% Consolidated other expense, net $ 71.3 $ 61.6 $ 20.2 $ 9.7 16 % $ 41.4 205 % Annual average cost of debt 5.3 % 6.1 % 5.7 % Total consolidated debt, net $ 1,219.3 $ 1,387.3 $ 503.9 $ (168.0 ) (12 )% $ 883.4 175 % The increases in other expense, net, for 2008 and 2007 as compared to the prior periods, were primarily due to increased interest expense driven by a higher level of debt which was used to fund the acquisition of TALX in 2007 and our share repurchase activity in both years. For additional information about our debt agreements, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Other income, net, in 2008 includes a $5.5 million gain on our repurchase of $20 million principal amount of ten year senior notes due 2017. The decrease in other income, net, in 2007 over 2006 was primarily due to the $14.1 million non taxable gain recognized during 2006 in connection with our Naviant litigation settlement. 29  Income Taxes Provision for Income Taxes Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Consolidated provision for income taxes $ 133.1 $ 151.9 $ 141.4 $ (18.8 ) (12 )% $ 10.5 7 % Effective income tax rate 32.8 % 35.8 % 34.0 % Our effective income tax rate for 2008 was down from 2007, primarily due to the recognition of a $14.6 million income tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions associated with our Brazilian operations, for which the statute of limitations expired during the third quarter of 2008. The 2007 increase in our effective income tax rate, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to changes in several tax reserves in 2006 that did not recur in 2007. This increase was partially offset by a lower foreign and state tax rate compared to 2006; a favorable second quarter 2007 discrete item related to our foreign tax credit utilization; and discrete items recorded during fourth quarter 2007, including a $2.9 million benefit for refunds related to our 2002 and 2003 U.S. federal income tax filings. Net Income Net Income Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Consolidated net income $ 272.8 $ 272.7 $ 274.5 $ 0.1 0 % $ (1.8 ) (1 )% Diluted earnings per common share $ 2.09 $ 2.02 $ 2.12 $ 0.07 4 % $ (0.10 ) (5 )% Weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share, in millions 130.4 135.1 129.4 Net income for 2008, as compared to 2007, was flat as contribution from TALX since its acquisition in May 2007, growth in operating income for International, North America Personal Solutions and North America Commercial Solutions, and lower income tax expense were offset by higher general corporate expense, which includes the aforementioned restructuring and asset write down charges recorded in 2008, lower operating income for our USCIS businesses and higher interest expense. The decline in net income for 2007, as compared to 2006, was a function of growth in operating income from our International, North America Personal Solutions and North America Commercial Solutions segments, when compared to 2006, and from the acquisition of TALX, more than offset by increased interest expense and a higher provision for income taxes. Our 2008 earnings per share, as compared to 2007, was positively impacted by the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding resulting from the repurchase of 4.5 million shares in 2008. Our 2007 earnings per share, as compared to 2006, was negatively impacted by the increase in our weighted average shares outstanding resulting from our issuance of 20.6 million shares of common stock in connection with the TALX acquisition in May 2007, partially offset by the impact of 17.9 million shares repurchased in 2007 subsequent to the acquisition. 30 Segment Financial Results U.S. Consumer Information Solutions U.S. Consumer Information Solutions Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Operating revenue: Online Consumer Information Solutions $ 594.5 $ 639.0 $ 619.2 $ (44.5 ) (7 )% $ 19.8 3 % Mortgage Solutions 70.2 66.1 71.7 4.1 6 % (5.6 ) (8 )% Credit Marketing Services 132.0 156.4 166.3 (24.4 ) (16 )% (9.9 ) (6 )% Direct Marketing Services 94.1 108.2 110.9 (14.1 ) (13 )% (2.7 ) (2 )% Total operating revenue $ 890.8 $ 969.7 $ 968.1 $ (78.9 ) (8 )% $ 1.6 0 % % of consolidated revenue 46 % 53 % 63 % Total operating income $ 337.1 $ 383.5 $ 395.7 $ (46.4 ) (12 )% $ (12.2 ) (3 )% Operating margin 37.9 % 39.6 % 40.9 % (1.7 ) pts (1.3 ) pts The decreases in revenue for 2008, as compared to 2007, were mainly due to effects of the continued weakness in the U.S. credit and retail economy, offset by growth in the Mortgage Solutions business primarily due to increased activity with our settlement services products. The slight increase in revenue in 2007, as compared to 2006, was due to growth in Online Consumer Information Solutions (OCIS), largely offset by decreased revenues in the other three service lines due primarily to weakness in the U.S. consumer credit and mortgage markets. Revenues in our OCIS and Credit Marketing Services service lines and in our USCIS segment as a whole decreased sequentially in each quarter during 2008, as a result of the weakening U.S. economy. Based on current rates of economic and credit activity in the U.S., we currently expect revenue in the OCIS and Credit Marketing Services service lines and in the overall USCIS segment in 2009 to be below levels achieved in 2008. OCIS. For 2008, as compared to 2007, revenue declined primarily due to a seven percent reduction of online credit decision transaction volume resulting from the weakness of the U.S. economy. The 2007 increase in revenue, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to volume increases from our regional customers and both volume and price increases from our smaller customers. Revenue from resellers also rose during 2007 due to price increases that became effective near the end of 2006, and we recorded higher revenue from our insurance, banking and regulatory brokerage monitoring customers. These increases were partially offset by price and volume decreases from certain large financial services institutions. Mortgage Solutions. For 2008, as compared to 2007, revenue grew due to a four fold increase in activity associated with our settlement services products and incremental revenue from our acquisition of certain assets of FIS Credit Services, Inc. in February 2008. These increases were partially offset by continued weakness in the U.S. housing market, which led to reduced transaction volumes from our existing mortgage customer base. The 2007 decline in revenue, as compared to 2006, was primarily a result of weakness in the U.S. mortgage markets, which led to reduced transaction volumes from our existing customer base and caused several large mortgage brokerage customers to cease operations during 2007. This decrease was partially offset by incremental revenue from our acquisition of three mortgage affiliates in the first quarter of 2007 and increased revenue related to new settlement services products. Credit Marketing Services. For 2008 and 2007, as compared to prior years, revenue declined due to volume decreases from our existing customer base, primarily due to lower revenue associated with new account acquisition services as financial institutions have scaled back significantly on new marketing and extension of credit. These declines were partially offset by a continued increase in revenue related to customer portfolio management services 31 used by institutions to manage and sustain existing customers. Our financial services customers began increased usage of our portfolio management services in 2007 and less usage of prescreen services, which reflects a continuing trend towards the enhanced management of their existing customer portfolios as opposed to new account acquisitions. Direct Marketing Services. For 2008, as compared to 2007, revenue declined primarily due to reduced mailing volumes for existing customers reflecting the slowdown in retail sales and the marketing campaigns of many retailers, as well as changes to a contract with a large marketing services reseller. The 2007 decrease in revenue, as compared to 2006, was mainly due to reduced mailing volumes from our existing customer base, driven in part by the increase in postage rates, partially offset by increased revenue from new and renewed contracts to provide services related to our customers marketing databases. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions Operating Margin. Operating margin decreased for 2008, as compared to 2007, mainly due to the decline in revenue described above. With a high portion of fixed costs, USCIS operating expenses generally do not decline at the same rate as our revenue. The decline in revenue was partially offset by lower production and royalty costs due to a decrease in volume, as well as the impact of cost saving initiatives. Recognizing the continuing impact in 2009 of current economic conditions, management has taken and is continuing to take steps to streamline operations and increase efficiency in order to minimize the potential negative effect on operating margins of lower annual revenue. The 2007 decline in operating margin, as compared to 2006, was primarily a result of the fixed cost nature of the USCIS business in the midst of revenue declines in our Mortgage Solutions, Credit Marketing Services and Direct Marketing Services business units. While revenue of the entire USCIS business was essentially flat, the operating expense of maintaining the databases, products, and customer support capabilities required for the business increased by 2.4%, reflecting annual compensation increases and enhanced product, processing and support capabilities. International International Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Operating revenue: Europe $ 175.0 $ 183.8 $ 153.6 $ (8.8 ) (5 )% $ 30.2 20 % Latin America 219.9 182.5 154.0 37.4 20 % 28.5 19 % Canada Consumer 110.8 106.5 95.2 4.3 4 % 11.3 12 % Total operating revenue $ 505.7 $ 472.8 $ 402.8 $ 32.9 7 % $ 70.0 17 % % of consolidated revenue 26 % 26 % 26 % Total operating income $ 149.9 $ 141.1 $ 118.1 $ 8.8 6 % $ 23.0 20 % Operating margin 29.6 % 29.8 % 29.3 % (0.2 ) pts 0.5 pts For 2008, as compared to 2007, revenue increased primarily due to growth in Latin America and Canada; offset by a decline in Europe due to weakness in the U.K. economy. Local currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar minimally impacted our International revenue in 2008 and provided a favorable impact in 2007 of $31.0 million, or 7%. In local currency, revenue was up 7% in 2008 and 10% in 2007, when compared to the prior year. The 2007 increase in revenue, as compared to 2006, is attributable to growth in all three geographical areas. As noted above regarding our consolidated operating revenue, if foreign exchange rates remain at levels consistent with December 31, 2008, foreign currency translation would negatively impact expected 2009 revenue by approximately $80 million. Europe. The decrease in revenue for 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency. Local currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted Europe revenue by $8.4 million, or 5%, for 2008, when compared to 2007. Growth in the U.K. in 32 the first half of 2008 was offset by declines in revenue, when compared to 2007, in the last six months of 2008 attributable to the weakening U.K. economy. The 2007 increase in revenue, as compared to 2006, was mainly attributable to our consumer risk products, with volume increases in the U.K. and new customers and pricing management strategies in Spain and Portugal. Local currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted 2007 Europe revenue growth by $14.6 million, or 10%, as revenue was up 10% in local currency. Latin America. For 2008, as compared to 2007, increased revenue was driven by double digit growth in all countries in which we operate. Local currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted Latin America revenue growth by $9.3 million, or 5%, for 2008, when compared to 2007, as revenue in local currency grew 15%, when comparing these periods. This broad based revenue growth was primarily due to higher volumes related to our online solutions, enabling technologies and marketing products, as well as a new contract in Brazil to provide data to a large regional consumer services data provider. The increases were also impacted by acquisitions of several small businesses in Ecuador, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and El Salvador during 2008. The 2007 increase in revenue, as compared to 2006, was driven by double digit sales growth in six of the seven country markets in which we operate, primarily due to higher volumes of our online solutions, enabling technologies and marketing products. This was partially offset by weaker performance, in local currency, from Brazil due to increased competition, as volumes from small and medium sized commercial customers declined. Local currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted our Latin America revenue growth by $10.2 million, or 7%, as revenue grew 12% in local currency in 2007. Canada Consumer. For 2008, as compared to 2007, revenue growth was driven by higher prices and volume related to our marketing services and technology products. Local currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted revenue growth by $1.2 million, or 1%, and revenue in local currency grew 3% for 2008, as compared to 2007. Although revenue increased year over year, revenue growth during the first nine months of 2008 was partially offset by weakness in the fourth quarter revenue due to the stronger U.S. dollar and deteriorating conditions in the Canadian economy. The 2007 increase in revenue, as compared to 2006, was primarily driven by price and volume increases for our consumer risk products, as well as increased volumes for marketing products. Local currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted revenue growth by $6.1 million, or 6%, as revenue grew 6% in local currency in 2007. International Operating Margin. Operating margin for 2008 was relatively flat at 29.6%, when compared to 2007 as operating expenses for the overall International business were generally managed in line with revenue. The 2007 increase in operating margin, as compared to 2006, was primarily driven by revenue growth, partially offset by higher production costs and increased salary costs due to additional headcount as we invest for international growth. The increase in production costs was impacted by certain vendor price reductions received by our European business during 2006 that did not recur in 2007. We also invested in our Canada Consumer business for mainframe and data center improvements. 33 TALX TALX Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Operating revenue: The Work Number $ 131.9 $ 72.6 $ 59.3 82 % nm nm Tax and Talent Management 173.2 106.8 66.4 62 % nm nm Total operating revenue $ 305.1 $ 179.4 $ 125.7 70 % nm nm % of consolidated revenue 16 % 10 % nm Total operating income $ 53.1 $ 29.3 $ 23.8 81 % nm nm Operating margin 17.4 % 16.3 % nm 1.1 pts nm nm not meaningful The financial results of TALXs operations are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on May 15, 2007, resulting in a partial period for 2007. This is the primary reason for the significant increase in revenue for 2008, as compared to 2007. The Work Number revenue for the third and fourth quarters of 2008, as compared to the same periods in 2007, increased 12 percent due to growth in the government and consumer collections sectors. For Tax and Talent Management Services, revenue declined two percent for the third and fourth quarters of 2008, as compared to 2007, as a result of reduced government hiring activity which impacted our Talent Management business. This decrease was partially offset by steady growth in Tax Management Services, driven by increased unemployment compensation claims activity. TALX acquisition related amortization expense was $54.5 million for 2008, compared to $34.0 million for 2007. Total employment records in The Work Number database increased during the year to 188.9 million at December 31, 2008, compared to 165.9 million at December 31, 2007. North America Personal Solutions North America Personal Solutions Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Total operating revenue $ 162.6 $ 153.5 $ 126.0 $ 9.1 6 % $ 27.5 22 % % of consolidated revenue 8 % 8 % 8 % Total operating income $ 46.3 $ 34.0 $ 13.6 $ 12.3 36 % $ 20.4 150 % Operating margin 28.4 % 22.1 % 10.8 % 6.3 pts 11.3 pts For 2008, as compared to 2007, revenue increased primarily due to higher subscription revenue associated with our 3 in 1 Monitoring, ScoreWatch, CreditWatch, ID Patrol and Credit Report Control products, partially offset by declines in transaction revenue and breach revenue. Although revenue increased year over year, revenue growth during the first nine months of 2008 was partially offset by a three percent decline in fourth quarter revenue due to lower breach, partner and transaction based revenue caused in part by the weakness in the U.S. economy. Subscription customers totaled 1.2 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in operating margin in 2008 is mainly due to continued subscription based revenue growth and reduced operating expenses driven by reduced customer support costs, when compared to 2007. The 2007 increase in revenue, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to higher subscription revenue associated with our 3 in 1 Monitoring, ScoreWatch and Credit Watch products. Subscription customers grew to 1.3 million in 2007, up from 1.0 million in 2006. This increase was partially offset by declining transactional revenue associated with our Credit Profiles, Score Power and Credit Rankings products. During 2007, we also increased revenues 34 through targeted advertising, improvement in the conversion of inquiries to sales, and growth in services provided in third party data breaches. The 2007 increase in operating margin, as compared to 2006, was mainly due to continued subscription based revenue growth, $5.0 million operating expense impact of legal contingencies in 2006 that did not recur in 2007, and decreased advertising expense due to a reduction in radio advertising. This improvement was partially offset by higher personnel and training costs due to higher call center volumes and the addition of a second outsourced call center in 2007. North America Commercial Solutions North America Commercial Solutions Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Total operating revenue $ 71.5 $ 67.6 $ 49.4 $ 3.9 6 % $ 18.2 37 % % of consolidated revenue 4 % 3 % 3 % Total operating income $ 13.6 $ 12.0 $ 9.9 $ 1.6 13 % $ 2.1 21 % Operating margin 19.0 % 17.7 % 20.2 % 1.3 pts (2.5 ) pts For 2008, as compared to 2007, revenue increased mainly due to higher sales volume for products in our U.S. Commercial business, as well as $0.3 million, or 1%, of favorable foreign currency impact. Although revenue increased year over year, revenue grew at low double digit rates during the first half of the year, but was essentially flat with the prior year in local currency due to increasing weakness in the U.S. and Canadian economies in the second half of the year. Online transaction volume for U.S. commercial credit information products increased to 4.9 million during 2008, up 4%, from 2007. For 2008, as compared to 2007, operating margin increased primarily due to revenue growth in our U.S. Commercial business partially offset by increased personnel and software costs as we continue to invest for future growth. The increase in revenue in 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to our October 2006 acquisition of Austin Tetra and volume growth in the U.S. and Canada as we continue to expand the markets for our commercial credit information and marketing products. Of the 37% revenue growth in 2007, as compared to 2006, Austin Tetra contributed 14% and Canada currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted revenue by 3%, or $1.5 million. The remaining 20% of revenue growth in 2007, as compared to 2006, was due to organic growth within our legacy North America Commercial Solutions product offerings. Online transaction volume for our U.S. commercial credit information products was 4.7 million in 2007, up from 3.6 million in 2006. The 2007 decrease in operating margin was primarily attributable to increased volume related costs and our investing for future growth in this segment, including higher salary costs in 2007 due to additional headcount. General Corporate Expense General Corporate Expense Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % General corporate expense $ 122.8 $ 113.7 $ 101.2 $ 9.1 8 % $ 12.5 12 % Our general corporate expenses are costs that are incurred at the corporate level and include those expenses impacted by corporate direction, such as shared services, administrative, legal, equity compensation costs and restructuring expenses. General corporate expenses for 2008, as compared to 2007, increased primarily as a result of a $16.8 million restructuring and asset write down charge during 2008, which consisted of a $10.3 million charge related to headcount reductions, a $4.1 million charge associated with certain contractual costs and a 35 $2.4 million software write down charge, all related to our business realignment. This increase was partially offset by reduced incentive costs, litigation and payroll tax. We expect an additional workforce reduction charge of $6 million to $8 million in the first quarter of 2009. The 2007 increase in general corporate expense, as compared to 2006, was primarily driven by our acquisition of TALX; higher litigation costs; expansion of corporate capabilities in key support areas, including marketing; and expenditures to enhance certain technology processes and development capabilities to support continued long term growth and operating efficiency. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. We continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remain in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing our capital structure to meet short and long term objectives. Sources and Uses of Cash Funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity. Despite the capital markets turmoil that emerged in September 2008, which had an adverse impact on our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of funds in the fourth quarter, we continue to have access to short term liquidity through our Senior Credit Facility. Conditions have improved and we have returned to utilization of our commercial paper program since year end; however, if conditions were to deteriorate, we are able to rely on our Senior Credit Facility, which does not mature until July 2011. At December 31, 2008, we had $427.0 million available to borrow on our Senior Credit Facility. Based on information available to us, we have no indication that the financial institutions included in our Senior Credit Facility would be unable to fulfill their commitments as of the filing date of this Form 10 K. Additionally, our Senior Credit Facility does not include a provision under which lenders could refuse to allow us to borrow under this facility in the event of a material adverse change in our financial condition as long as we are in compliance with the covenants in the agreement. We believe that funds generated from expected results of operations and available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements (such as capital expenditures, interest payments, potential pension funding contributions, dividend payments and stock repurchases, if any) for the foreseeable future. If the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and the availability of funds remains limited in 2009, we could incur increased costs associated with issuing commercial paper and or other debt instruments. In addition, it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited by these or other factors at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions. See further discussion of our borrowings and credit facility availability below. 36  Information about our cash flows, by category, is presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Net cash provided by (used in): Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Operating activities $ 444.7 $ 449.9 $ 372.1 $ (5.2 ) (1 )% $ 77.8 21 % Investing activities $ (141.6 ) $ (422.3 ) $ (86.8 ) $ 280.7 nm $ (335.5 ) nm Financing activities $ (315.7 ) $ (17.6 ) $ (255.0 ) $ (298.1 ) nm $ 237.4 nm nm not meaningful Operating Activities Cash provided by operations in 2008 of $444.7 million was one percent less than 2007. Although 2008 net income was flat when compared to 2007, higher depreciation and amortization expense and improved accounts receivable collections were offset by year to year reductions in operating liabilities. The 2007 increase in operating cash flow, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to incremental income from our TALX acquisition, revenue growth in our existing businesses and positive changes in our working capital, partially offset by increased interest payments. Fund Transfer Limitations. The ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited, in some cases, by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments; these restrictions do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness, meet our current obligations or pay dividends. Investing Activities Capital Expenditures Net cash used in: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Capital expenditures $ 110.5 $ 118.5 $ 52.0 $ (8.0 ) $ 66.5 Our capital expenditures are used for developing, enhancing and deploying new and existing software in support of our expanding product set, replacing or adding equipment, updating systems for regulatory compliance, the licensing of software applications and investing in system reliability, security and disaster recovery enhancements. During 2007, our capital expenditures increased due to the purchase of our data center facility in Atlanta, Georgia for cash consideration of approximately $30 million, as well as the assumption of the prior owners $12.5 million mortgage obligation due in 2012, and improvements made to this facility. Capital expenditures in 2008 continued to be higher than the periods prior to 2007 due to completion of improvements of our data center. We expect capital expenditures in 2009 to be less than 2008 or 2007, due to substantial completion of the Atlanta data center improvements, but still in the range of $75 million to $100 million, as we continue to invest for growth. Acquisitions and Investments Net cash used in: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired $ 27.4 $ 303.8 $ 34.8 $ (276.4 ) $ 269.0 Investment in unconsolidated affiliates $ 3.7 $ $ $ 3.7 $ 37 2008 Acquisitions and Investments. To further enhance our market share and grow our credit data business, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, we completed nine acquisitions and investments in small businesses totaling $27.4 million, net of cash acquired. Six of the transactions were in our International segment, two within our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions segment and one within our TALX segment. The acquisition within our TALX segment, completed in the fourth quarter of 2008, is subject to a contingent earn out payment not to exceed $6.0 million measured on the accomplishment of 2009 revenue targets. The results of these acquisitions are not material. On June 30, 2008, as a part of our long term growth strategy of entering new geographies, we acquired a 28 percent equity interest in Global Payments Credit Services LLC, or GPCS, a credit information company in Russia, for cash consideration of $4.4 million, which is now doing business as Equifax Credit Services, LLC in Russia. Under our shareholders agreement, we have the option to acquire up to an additional 22 percent interest in GPCS between 2011 and 2013 for cash consideration based on a formula for determining equity value of the business and the assumption of certain debt, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. 2007 Acquisitions. On May 15, 2007, we acquired all the outstanding shares of TALX. Under the terms of the transaction, we issued 20.6 million shares of Equifax treasury stock and 1.9 million fully vested options to purchase Equifax common stock, and paid approximately $288.1 million in cash, net of cash acquired. We also assumed TALXs outstanding debt, which had a fair value totaling $177.6 million at May 15, 2007. We financed the cash portion of the acquisition and $96.6 million outstanding on the TALX revolving credit facility at the date of acquisition initially with borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility, and subsequently refinanced this debt in the second quarter of 2007 with ten and thirty year notes. Subsequent to the date of the acquisition, we paid $4.1 million to the former owners of a company purchased by TALX pursuant to an earn out agreement. On October 19, 2007, in order to continue to grow our credit data business, our Peruvian subsidiary purchased 100% of the stock of a credit reporting business located in Peru for cash consideration of approximately $8.0 million. 2006 Acquisitions. On October 6, 2006, we acquired Austin Consolidated Holdings, Inc., known as Austin Tetra, for $34.4 million in cash. Austin Tetra is a provider of business to business data management and enhancement services to the commercial market. For additional information about our acquisitions, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K.

Equifaxs $850.0 million five year unsecured revolving credit facility (which we refer to as the Senior Credit Facility), with a group of banks expires in July 2011. Our $850.0 million commercial paper program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of commercial paper notes. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to 397 days. The commercial paper program is supported by our Senior 38 Credit Facility and, pursuant to our existing Board of Directors authorization, the total amount of commercial paper which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. In June 2008, we entered into a new 364 day revolving credit agreement with a Canadian financial institution that replaced a previous credit facility with the bank; the permitted borrowings were increased from C$10.0 million (denominated in Canadian dollars) to C$40.0 million and financial and other covenants were updated and conformed to those contained in our Senior Credit Facility. The new Canadian Credit Facility terminates in June 2009 and is available for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2008, $420.0 million was outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility, which is included in long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet; and $25.8 million was outstanding under our short term Canadian Credit Facility; and $3.0 million in commercial paper notes was outstanding. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings, all with maturities less than 90 days, was 2.1% per annum. At December 31, 2008, a total of $434.0 million was available under our committed credit facilities. Although outstanding commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2008 were significantly less than the $219.5 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2007, this decrease was driven by our effort to lower the effective cost of our variable rate borrowing by alternating borrowing under our Senior Credit Facility and through the commercial paper program, when available, based on the rates available to us. At December 31, 2008, approximately 63% of our debt was fixed rate debt and 37% was variable rate debt. Our variable rate debt, consisting of commercial paper notes and borrowings under our credit facilities, generally bears interest based on a specified margin plus a base rate (LIBOR) or on commercial paper rates. The interest rates reset periodically, depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements. At December 31, 2008, interest rates on our variable rate debt ranged from 1.7% to 2.4%. Borrowing and Repayment Activity. Net short term (repayments) borrowings during 2008 and 2007 primarily represent activity under our commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our Senior Credit Facility as described above, as well as activity under our Canadian Credit Facility in 2008. In 2008, the activity in this balance primarily reflects the net repayment of $216.5 million of the balance outstanding on our commercial paper notes at December 31, 2007, offset by the increase of $25.8 million in borrowings under our Canadian Credit Facility. In 2007, net borrowing activity under our commercial paper program was partially offset by net repayments under our trade receivables backed revolving credit facility, which we elected to terminate on November 29, 2007. The 2006 net short term (repayments) borrowings represent activity under our trade receivables backed revolving credit facility. Net borrowings (repayments) under long term revolving credit facilities during 2008, 2007 and 2006 relate to activity on our Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchase programs. In 2008, the net borrowing activity under long term revolving credit facilities primarily represents our pay down of $216.5 million of commercial paper notes outstanding at December 31, 2007 from cash from operations and borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility to lower the average cost of our debt and due to the adverse conditions in the commercial paper market discussed above. In 2007, the net borrowing activity under long term revolving credit facilities primarily represents our refinancing of the $250.0 million principal amount relating to our 4.95% notes in November 2007. During 2008, we purchased $20.0 million principal amount of the ten year senior notes issued in 2007 for $14.3 million. There were no material payments on long term debt during 2006. On June 28, 2007, we issued $300.0 million principal amount of 6.3%, ten year senior notes and $250.0 million principal amount of 7.0%, thirty year senior notes, which we refer to collectively as the Senior Notes, in underwritten public offerings. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes to reduce the amount outstanding in our commercial paper program. In conjunction with the sale of the Senior Notes, we entered into cash flow hedges on $200.0 million and $250.0 million notional amount, respectively, of ten year and thirty year treasury notes. These hedges were settled in cash on June 25 and 26, 2007, respectively, the date the Senior 39 Notes were sold, requiring a cash payment by us of $1.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively. There were no material proceeds from the issuance of long term debt during 2008 and 2006. Debt Covenants. Our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. In addition, our Senior Credit Facility and Canadian Credit Facility each require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 3.5 to 1.0. Our leverage ratio was 1.98 to 1.0 at December 31, 2008. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and, as of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. We do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our outstanding debt; however, our Senior Notes, discussed above, contain change in control provisions. If we experience a change of control or publicly announce our intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the Senior Notes is lowered by each of Standard & Poors, or S&P, and Moodys Investors Service, or Moodys, below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof, then we will be required to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Credit Ratings. Credit ratings reflect an independent agencys judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrowers industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a companys cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, S&P and Moodys, use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moodys, respectively. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Long term ratings of BBB and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moodys, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be "investment grade". At December 31, 2008, the long term ratings for our obligations were BBB+ and Baa1, which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at December 31, 2007. A downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our commercial paper program and credit facilities, and could limit, or in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. If our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt. In addition, the markets demand for, and thus our ability to readily issue, new debt could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment. For additional information about our debt, including the terms of our financing arrangements, basis for variable interest rates and debt covenants, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had $158.2 million remaining for stock repurchases under the existing Board authorization. As of February 20, 2009, we had acquired an additional 0.4 million shares for $9.1 million since December 31, 2008. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we paid cash dividends of $20.5 million, $20.7 million and $20.3 million, respectively, at $0.16 per share for all periods. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2008. The table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time. Some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table. Payments due by (In millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years Thereafter Debt(1) $ 1,217.3 $ 31.9 $ 458.9 $ 31.5 $ 695.0 Operating leases(2) 122.7 20.6 28.4 18.5 55.2 Data processing, outsourcing agreements and other purchase obligations(3) 305.3 91.2 125.8 81.3 7.0 Other long term liabilities(4)(6) 89.9 9.1 15.4 8.8 56.6 Interest payments(5) 941.9 60.7 117.0 93.6 670.6 $ 2,677.1 $ 213.5 $ 745.5 $ 233.7 $ 1,484.4 (1) The amounts are gross of unamortized discounts totaling $2.1 million and a purchase accounting fair value adjustment of $4.1 million at December 31, 2008. Total debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is net of the unamortized discounts and fair value adjustment. (2) Our operating lease obligations principally involve office space and equipment, which includes the lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in 2010 and the ground lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in 2048. (3) These agreements primarily represent our minimum contractual obligations for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions, and certain administrative functions. These agreements expire between 2009 and 2013. (4) These long term liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension, postretirement and other compensation related plans, some of which are discounted in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. We made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments. In the table above, we have not included amounts related to future pension plan obligations, as such required funding amounts beyond 2009 have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance. During January 2009, we made a $15.0 million contribution to fund our Equifax Inc. Pension Plan. (5) For future interest payments on related variable rate debt, which is generally based on LIBOR or commercial paper plus a specified margin, we used the variable rate in effect at December 31, 2008 to calculate these payments. The variable portion of the rate at December 31, 2008 (excluding the margin and facility fees) was between 1.7% and 2.4% for substantially all of our variable rate debt. Future interest payments related to our $850.0 million revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program are based on the borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2008 through their respective maturity dates, assuming such borrowings are outstanding until that time. Future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity under this revolving credit facility. (6) This table excludes $22.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. A potential significant future use of cash would be the payment to Computer Sciences Corporation, or CSC, if it were to exercise its option to sell its credit reporting business to us at any time prior to 2013. The option exercise price would be determined by agreement or by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option. We estimate that if the option had been exercised at December 31, 2008, the price range would have been approximately $600.0 million to 41 $675.0 million. This estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business, current market conditions and other factors, all of which are subject to constant change. Therefore, the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than our estimate. Our agreement with CSC, which expires on July 31, 2018, also provides us with an option to purchase its credit reporting business if it does not elect to renew the agreement or if there is a change in control of CSC while the agreement is in effect. If CSC were to exercise its option, or if we were able to and decided to exercise our option, then we would have to obtain additional sources of funding. We believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the capital markets for debt and or equity financing. However, the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors, including credit market conditions, the state of the equity markets, general economic conditions, our credit ratings and our financial performance and condition. Off Balance Sheet Transactions Other than facility leasing arrangements and limited foreign currency hedge activity, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. In 1998, we entered into a synthetic lease on our Atlanta corporate headquarters building in order to obtain favorable financing terms with regard to this facility. This $29.0 million lease expires in March 2010. Lease payments for the remaining term totaled $2.2 million at December 31, 2008. Under this synthetic lease arrangement, we have guaranteed the residual value of the leased property to the lessor. In the event that the property were to be sold by the lessor at the end of the lease term, we would be responsible for any shortfall of the sales proceeds, up to a maximum amount of $23.2 million, which equals 80% of the value of the property at the beginning of the lease term. The liability for this shortfall, which was $1.9 million at December 31, 2008, is recorded in other long term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Pursuant to the terms of the industrial revenue bonds, we transferred title of certain fixed assets with a cost of $28.4 million, as of December 31, 2008, to a local governmental authority in the U.S. to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development. The title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds. These fixed assets are still recognized in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as all risks and rewards remain with the Company. Letters of Credit and Guarantees We will from time to time issue standby letters of credit, performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business. The aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at December 31, 2008, and all have a maturity of two years or less. Guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units. In connection with the sale of our risk management collections business to RMA Holdings, LLC, or RMA, in October 2000, we guaranteed the operating lease payments of a partnership affiliated with RMA to a lender of the partnership pursuant to a term loan. The operating lease, which expires December 31, 2011, has a remaining balance of $4.0 million, based on the undiscounted value of remaining lease payments, including real estate taxes, at December 31, 2008. On September 12, 2005, RMA sold substantially all of its assets to NCO Group, Inc., or NCO. In conjunction with this sale, NCO agreed to assume the operating lease obligations discussed above, which we will continue to guarantee. We believe that the likelihood of demand for payment by us is minimal and expect no material losses to occur related to this guarantee. Accordingly, we do not have a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2008 or 2007 related to this guarantee. Benefit Plans At December 31, 2008, our U.S. Retirement Income Plan, or USRIP, and the Equifax Inc. Pension Plan, or EIPP, met or exceeded ERISAs minimum funding requirements. In January 2009, 2007 and 2006, we made contributions of $15.0 million, $12.0 million and $20.0 million, respectively, to the EIPP. We also made a $2.0 million discretionary contribution in 2006 to fund certain other post retirement benefit plans. In the future, we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions, depending on certain circumstances, including market conditions and liquidity needs. We believe additional funding contributions, if any, would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs, which are primarily 42 funded from cash flows generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and our credit facilities. For our non U.S., tax qualified retirement plans, we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations. For the non qualified supplementary retirement plans, we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants, but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with GAAP. For additional information about our benefit plans, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Seasonality We experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams. Revenue generated from The Work Number and Tax and Talent Management business units within the TALX operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of Form W 2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year. Revenue from our OCIS and Mortgage Solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions, most commonly the second and third calendar quarters. Effects of Inflation and Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Equifaxs operating results are not materially affected by inflation, although inflation may result in increases in the Companys expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments, it may adversely affect the Companys financial position and profitability. A significant portion of the Companys business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of non U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored. Although the Company historically has not adopted strategies designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on the Companys financial performance, where cost justified the Company may elect to do so in the future. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. This requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. In addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Income. We also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results. For additional information about these policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured, the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed. 43  If at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment. If there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. If at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. We have certain information solution offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements. To account for each of these elements separately, the delivered elements must have stand alone value to our customer, and there must exist objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for any undelivered elements. Judgments and uncertainties Each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables. These considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value; concluding when the element will be delivered; and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services. For certain contracts containing multiple elements, the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their relative fair values and to the initial delivered elements using the residual method. If we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate elements for accounting or fair value is not known for any undelivered elements, arrangement consideration may only be recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer. In addition, the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears. In these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past. Differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported. Effects if actual results differ from assumptions We have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past. We monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future. If we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates, revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future, we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets We review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually (as of September 30) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", or SFAS 142. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, or competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Judgments and uncertainties The provisions of SFAS 142 require that we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Our reporting units are one level below our operating segments and represent our various business lines. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on 44 market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. SFAS 142 also requires that the fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives be estimated and compared to the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using an income approach. We recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite lived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk adjusted discount rates, foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value. Effect if actual results differ from assumptions We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. Additionally, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. Loss Contingencies We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," we determine whether to disclose and or accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable, reasonably possible or remote. Judgments and uncertainties We periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for the estimated settlement costs. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible, but not probable, we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency. Our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective. Effect if actual results differ from assumptions We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies. However, if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates, we may be exposed to a loss that could be material. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," and FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." We record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid. We periodically assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies. To the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable. Our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities. We record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations. Regularly, we assess the 45 potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals. Judgments and uncertainties We consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets. These judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income, mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions, and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. We regularly review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. These adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense. Settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash. At December 31, 2008, we have $22.3 million recorded for uncertain tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of which it is reasonably possible that up to $6.0 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months. Effect if actual results differ from assumptions Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material. Pension and Other Postretirement Plans Our pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)." Actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost as required by SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pension," or SFAS 87, and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions". We consider accounting for our U.S. and Canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, which include discount rates, salary growth, expected return on plan assets, interest cost and mortality rates. Judgments and uncertainties We believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are (1) the discount rate and (2) the expected return on plan assets. We determine our discount rates primarily based on high quality, fixed income investments and yield to maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date. Discount rates are reset annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions. We use a publicly published yield curve updated monthly to develop our discount rates. The yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated high quality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period, from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class, as provided by our external investment advisor. Prior to 2008, the U.S. Pension Plans investment returns were 10.9%, 13.0% and 7.5% over three, five and ten years, respectively. The returns exceeded the S&P 500 returns for similar periods of time primarily due to an asset allocation strategy where large allocations to alternative asset classes (hedge fund of funds, private equity, real estate and real assets) provided consistently higher returns with a low correlation to equity market returns. These returns historically demonstrate a long term record of producing returns at or above the expected rate of return. In 2008, the investment returns were approximately negative 20%, exceeding the S&P 500 index returns (over negative 38%), and again reflecting the asset allocation benefit. We feel 2008 investment market returns were abnormal and are not reflective of our expected future investment returns. Our external investment advisor has 46 provided projected ten year investment returns by asset class and, based on our asset allocation strategy, the expected return assumes a return to pre 2008 historical trends. Under SFAS 87, the expected long term rate of return is calculated on the market related value of assets. SFAS 87 allows for the use of an asset value that smoothes actual investment gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets over a period up to five years. We have elected to smooth asset gains and losses on our pension plans over the five year period. Annual differences, if any, between the expected and actual returns are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount. We generally amortize any unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss, in accordance with SFAS 87, in net periodic pension expense over the average future service of active employees or over the remaining lifespan for retired participants. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. Effect if actual results differ from assumptions We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material. Adjusting our expected long term rate of return (8.00% at December 31, 2008) by 0.5% would change our estimated pension expense in 2009 by approximately $2.9 million. Adjusting our weighted average discount rate (6.23% at December 31, 2008) by 0.5% would change our estimated pension expense in 2009 by approximately $2.0 million. 47  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of our business, we are exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, that could impact our results of operations and financial position. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities, and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge certain of these exposures. We use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk A substantial majority of our revenue, expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we do transact business in other currencies, primarily the British pound, the Chilean peso, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. For most of these foreign currencies, we are a net recipient, and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. We are required to translate, or express in U.S. dollars, the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable year end rate of exchange on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year. We record the resulting translation adjustment, and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a long term investment nature within other comprehensive income, as a component of our shareholders equity. Other immaterial foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates, although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency. For the year ended December 31, 2008, a 10% weaker U.S. dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2008 would have increased our revenue by $52.3 million and our pre tax operating profit by $16.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007, a 10% weaker U.S. dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2007 would have increased our revenue by $46.1 million and our pre tax operating profit by $14.4 million. A 10% stronger U.S. dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pre tax operating profit for 2008 and 2007. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variable rate, long term Senior Credit Facility and commercial paper borrowings. We attempt to achieve the lowest all in weighted average cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt, and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt. At December 31, 2008, our weighted average cost of debt was 4.9% and weighted average life of debt was 11.5 years. At December 31, 2008, 63% of our debt was fixed rate, and the remaining 37% was variable rate. Occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps. A 1% change in the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt would have reduced our 2008 net income by approximately $5 million. Based on the amount of outstanding variable rate debt, we have material exposure to interest rate risk. In the future, if our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variable rate debt, we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk. The nature and amount of our long term and short term debt, as well as the proportionate amount of fixed rate and variable rate debt, can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. 48
