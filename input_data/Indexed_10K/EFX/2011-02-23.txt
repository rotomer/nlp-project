ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As used herein, the terms Equifax, the Company, we, our and us refer to Equifax Inc., a Georgia corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries as a combined entity, except where it is clear that the terms mean only Equifax Inc. All references to earnings per share data in Managements Discussion and Analysis, or MD&A, are to diluted earnings per share, or EPS, unless otherwise noted. Diluted EPS is calculated to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in additional common shares outstanding. BUSINESS OVERVIEW We are a leading global provider of information solutions, employment, income and identity verifications and human resources business process outsourcing services. We leverage some of the largest sources of consumer and commercial data, along with advanced analytics and proprietary technology, to create customized insights which enable our business customers to grow faster, more efficiently, and more profitably, and to inform and empower consumers. Businesses rely on us for consumer and business credit intelligence, credit portfolio management, fraud detection, decisioning technology, marketing tools, and human resources and payroll services. We also offer a portfolio of products that enable individual consumers to manage their financial affairs and protect their identity. Our revenue stream is diversified among individual consumers and among businesses across a wide range of industries and international geographies. Segment and Geographic Information Segments. The U.S. Consumer Information Solutions, or USCIS, segment, the largest of our five segments, consists of three product and service lines: Online Consumer Information Solutions, or OCIS; Mortgage Solutions; and Consumer Financial Marketing Services. OCIS and Mortgage Solutions revenue is principally transaction based and is derived from our sales of products such as consumer credit reporting and scoring, mortgage settlement services, identity verification, fraud detection and modeling services. USCIS also markets certain of our decisioning products which facilitate and automate a variety of consumer credit oriented decisions. Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue is principally project and subscription based and is derived from our sales of batch credit, consumer wealth or demographic information such as those that assist clients in acquiring new customers, cross selling to existing customers and managing portfolio risk. The International segment consists of Latin America, Europe and Canada Consumer. Canada Consumers products and services are similar to our USCIS offerings, while Europe and Latin America are made up of varying mixes of product lines that are in our USCIS, North America Commercial Solutions and North America Personal Solutions reportable segments. The TALX segment consists of The Work Number and Tax and Talent Management business units. The Work Number revenue is transaction based and is derived primarily from employment, income and social security number verifications. Tax and Talent Management revenues are derived from our provision of certain human resources business process outsourcing services that include both transaction and subscription based product offerings. These services assist our customers with the administration of unemployment claims and employer based tax credits and the assessment of new hires. North America Personal Solutions revenue is both transaction and subscription based and is derived from the sale of credit monitoring, debt management and identity theft protection products, which we deliver to consumers through the mail and electronically via the internet. North America Commercial Solutions revenue is principally transaction based, with the remainder project based, and is derived from the sale of business information, credit scores and portfolio analytics that enable customers to utilize our reports to make financial, marketing and purchasing decisions related to businesses. 27 Geographic Information. We currently operate in the following countries: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, Spain, the U.K., Uruguay, and the U.S. Our operations in Costa Rica and the Republic of Ireland focus on data handling and customer support activities. We own an equity interest in a consumer credit information company in Russia. During 2009, we formed a joint venture to provide a broad range of credit data and information solutions in India. Of the countries we operate in, 73% of our revenue was generated in the U.S. during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. Key Performance Indicators. Management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor operating and financial performance. These performance indicators include measurements of operating revenue, change in operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share, cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures. The key performance indicators for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, include the following: Key Performance Indicators Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Operating revenue $ 1,859.5 $ 1,716.0 $ 1,813.6 Operating revenue change 8 % 5 % 6 % Operating income $ 430.0 $ 381.8 $ 439.0 Operating margin 23.1 % 22.2 % 24.2 % Net income attributable to Equifax $ 266.7 $ 233.9 $ 272.8 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.86 $ 1.70 $ 1.91 Cash provided by operating activities $ 352.6 $ 418.4 $ 448.1 Capital expenditures $ 99.8 $ 70.7 $ 110.5 Operational and Financial Highlights. On April 23, 2010, we sold our APPRO loan origination software business (APPRO) for approximately $72 million. On July 1, 2010, we sold the assets of our Direct Marketing Services division (DMS) for approximately $117 million. On October 1, 2010, we acquired Anakam, Inc., a provider of large scale, software based, multi factor authentication solutions for $64.3 million. Anakam is part of our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions segment. We repurchased 5.2 million shares of our common stock on the open market for $167.5 million during 2010. Total debt was $1.0 billion at December 31, 2010, a decrease of $174.5 million from December 31, 2009. Business Environment, Company Outlook and Strategy Consumer and small business lending activity, which is one of the drivers of demand for our services, has stabilized in most markets around the world, but in most cases is not yet showing significant growth. We expect growth in consumer lending to continue to lag the general economic recovery, particularly in the more mature markets. In addition, new financial regulations are increasing the compliance requirements for many of our customers, introducing new challenges and opportunities in the marketing of our product and service offerings to financial institutions. In an effort to respond to these challenges, we have focused on the following initiatives and activities: We are further diversifying our revenues by pursuing and investing in key strategic initiatives including new product innovation, differentiated decisioning solutions and analytics leveraging our diverse data assets and technology. 28 We have reorganized our sales force and have key customer teams dedicated to our largest accounts. We have divested two product lines that were considered non strategic, APPRO loan origination software and Direct Marketing Services. We continue to acquire new data assets and technologies and pursue international expansion. We continue to focus on managing our expenses through the use of LEAN, Work Out and other process improvement initiatives. For 2011, the operating environment will continue to create challenges for the marketing and growth of our traditional products and services, but will also create new opportunities for our more recently developed products which leverage our diverse data assets, analytical capabilities and technology to improve customers decisioning capabilities and risk management activities. In 2011, we expect improvements in the credit economy to be modest and therefore not contribute measurably to organic growth. However, we do expect to derive organic growth through our new product offerings and from the momentum we achieved as a result of our performance in 2010. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008 Consolidated Financial Results Operating Revenue Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Operating Revenue 2010 2009 2008 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) U.S. Consumer Information Solutions $ 743.0 $ 712.2 $ 768.7 $ 30.8 4 % $ (56.5 ) 7 % International 482.8 438.6 505.7 44.2 10 % (67.1 ) 13 % TALX 395.6 346.4 305.1 49.2 14 % 41.3 14 % North America Personal Solutions 157.6 149.0 162.6 8.6 6 % (13.6 ) 8 % North America Commercial Solutions 80.5 69.8 71.5 10.7 15 % (1.7 ) 2 % Consolidated operating revenue $ 1,859.5 $ 1,716.0 $ 1,813.6 $ 143.5 8 % $ (97.6 ) 5 % Revenue from continuing operations increased by 8% compared to 2009. The favorable effect of foreign exchange rates increased revenue by $24.1 million, or 1.4%, in 2010 compared to the prior year period. Revenue grew over the prior year in each of our operating segments, primarily driven by strong execution of key strategic initiatives as well as growth contributed by 2009 acquisitions in USCIS and TALX. For additional information about revenue fluctuations and operating income by segment, see Segment Financial Results below. The decrease in revenue from continuing operations for 2009, as compared to 2008, was primarily due to continued global economic weakness, which significantly impacted demand for our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions, International and North America Personal Solutions business units when compared to 2008, as well as the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange rates. Foreign currency negatively impacted 2009 revenue by $48.9 million, or 3%. This decrease was partially offset by strength in our TALX segment and Mortgage Solutions business within U.S. Consumer Information Solutions. 29 Operating Expenses Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Operating Expenses 2010 2009 2008 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Consolidated cost of services $ 759.9 $ 718.8 $ 741.8 $ 41.1 6 % $ (23.0 ) 3 % Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses 507.4 470.2 490.6 37.2 8 % (20.4 ) 4 % Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense 162.2 145.2 142.2 17.0 12 % 3.0 2 % Consolidated operating expenses $ 1,429.5 $ 1,334.2 $ 1,374.6 $ 95.3 7 % $ (40.4 ) 3 % Cost of Services. The increase in cost of services from continuing operations, when compared to 2009, was due primarily to the impact of increased salary and incentives expense of $6.3 million; the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which increased our cost of services by $11.4 million; and the impact of our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions of IXI Corporation and Rapid Reporting Verification Company. The decrease in cost of services from continuing operations for 2009, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased our cost of services by $19.2 million during 2009. The remaining decrease was due to lower technology outsourcing costs resulting from a renegotiated contract with a large service provider and lower personnel costs resulting from our third quarter 2008 and 2009 headcount reductions. This decrease was partially offset by increased production costs related to growth in demand for our settlement services products within our Mortgage Solutions business and increased postretirement employee benefit costs. We reclassified $13.2 million of selling, general and administrative expense during the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 to cost of services to conform to the current period presentation. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations of $37.2 million in 2010 when compared to 2009, was due to changes in foreign exchange rates, which increased 2010 expense by $5.2 million, and increased salary, incentive and benefits expenses of $32.3 million, offset by $24.8 million in restructuring charges that were incurred during 2009 that did not recur in 2010. The remaining increase was primarily due to the impact of the inclusion of businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations for 2009 decreased $20.4 million when compared to 2008. Of this decline, $12.7 million resulted from foreign currency translation. The remaining decrease was primarily due to reduced legal expenses, lower technology and occupancy costs and reduced personnel and incentive costs due to the 2008 and 2009 headcount reductions, partially offset by a $10.4 million increase in restructuring charges in 2009, increased advertising and insurance costs and higher postretirement employee benefits cost. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations in 2010 increased $17.0 million as compared to 2009 primarily due to our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions which contributed $9.0 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense, as well as the effect of recent investments in new products and technology infrastructure. Depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations increased $3.0 million in 2009 over 2008. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation impact of $2.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense increased $5.6 million over the prior year. The increase is primarily due to our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions of IXI Corporation and Rapid Reporting Verification Company which contributed $1.8 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense and the inclusion of a full year of depreciation and amortization expense for our 2008 acquisitions, partially offset by the absence of a $2.4 million software write down charge recognized in 2008. For additional information about our restructuring charges, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. 30 Operating Income and Operating Margin Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Operating Income and Operating Margin 2010 2009 2008 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Consolidated operating revenue $ 1,859.5 $ 1,716.0 $ 1,813.6 $ 143.5 8 % $ (97.6 ) 5 % Consolidated operating expenses (1,429.5 ) (1,334.2 ) (1,374.6 ) (95.3 ) 7 % 40.4 3 % Consolidated operating income $ 430.0 $ 381.8 $ 439.0 $ 48.2 13 % $ (57.2 ) 13 % Consolidated operating margin 23.1 % 22.2 % 24.2 % 0.9 pts 2.0 pts The increase in operating income from continuing operations and operating margin for 2010, as compared to 2009, is primarily attributed to the 8% increase in revenue and $24.8 million of restructuring charges in 2009 that did not recur in 2010. The decline in operating margin for 2009, as compared to 2008, was primarily due to lower operating income in our USCIS, International and North America Personal Solutions segments and $8.0 million of additional restructuring charges in 2009, partially offset by growth in our TALX operating income. The operating income declines for the aforementioned segments are attributed to reductions in revenue resulting from global economic weakness, partially offset by lower operating expenses due to headcount reductions, reduced incentive costs and lower technology outsourcing costs. Other Expense, Net Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Other Expense, Net 2010 2009 2008 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Consolidated interest expense $ 56.1 $ 57.0 $ 71.3 $ (0.9 ) 2 % $ (14.3 ) 20 % Consolidated other income, net (1.3 ) (6.2 ) (6.2 ) 4.9 79 % 0 % Consolidated other expense, net $ 54.8 $ 50.8 $ 65.1 $ 4.0 8 % $ (14.3 ) 22 % Average cost of debt 5.2 % 4.8 % 5.3 % Total consolidated debt, net, at year end $ 999.6 $ 1,174.1 $ 1,219.3 $ (174.5 ) 15 % $ (45.2 ) 4 % The increase in other expense, net, from continuing operations for 2010, as compared to 2009, was primarily due to a decline in other income, net. Other income, net, for 2009 included a $2.2 million mark to market adjustment on certain insurance policies, a $1.1 million gain on our repurchase of $7.5 million principal amount of our ten year senior notes due 2017 and a $1.3 million gain related to a litigation settlement. Interest expense decreased slightly for 2010, when compared to 2009, as a decrease in our average debt balance from $1.18 billion to $1.07 billion more than offset an increase in the average interest rate on our total debt from 4.8% in 2009 to 5.2% in 2010. The increase in our average interest rate paid was caused by a reduction in short term, floating rate commercial paper, while longer term fixed rate debt outstanding remained essentially unchanged. The decrease in other expense, net, for 2009, as compared to 2008, was primarily due to lower interest rates on our floating rate debt, which drove the average cost of our total debt from 5.3% in 2008 to 4.8% in 2009, as well as a reduced level of debt outstanding during 2009. Our average debt balance fell to $1.18 billion in 2009 from $1.34 billion in 2008. For additional information about our debt agreements, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Other income, net, for 2009 primarily includes a $2.2 million mark to market adjustment on certain insurance policies, a $1.1 million gain on our repurchase of $7.5 million principal amount of our ten year senior notes due 2017 and a $1.3 million gain related to a litigation settlement. Other income, net in 2008 includes a $5.5 million gain on our repurchase of $20 million principal amount of ten year senior notes due 2017. 31 Income Taxes Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Provision for Income Taxes 2010 2009 2008 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Consolidated provision for income taxes $ 131.9 $ 106.6 $ 119.0 $ 25.3 24 % $ (12.4 ) 10 % Effective income tax rate 35.1 % 32.2 % 31.8 % Our effective tax rate was 35.1% for 2010, up from 32.2% for the same period in 2009. The 2010 rate was higher due primarily to the prior year recognition of a $7.3 million income tax benefit related to our ability to utilize foreign tax credits beyond 2009, more favorable discrete items in 2009 related to foreign and state taxes and a 2009 investment loss in subsidiary, partially offset by a permanent federal deduction realized in 2010. We expect our effective tax rate in 2011 to increase to a range of 36% to 38%. Our effective income tax rate for 2009 was up slightly compared to 2008. The 2009 rate reflects the recognition of a $7.3 million income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to our ability to utilize foreign tax credits beyond 2009. Additionally, we recorded favorable discrete items in 2009 related to foreign and state taxes and an investment loss in a subsidiary. With the fourth quarter 2009 adjustments, we have recognized the benefit of foreign tax credit carryforwards that would have reduced future tax expense. The 2008 rate reflects $14.6 million in income tax benefits that we recorded related to uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitations had expired which resulted in a lower effective income tax rate in 2008 as compared to 2009. Net Income Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Net Income 2010 2009 2008 $ % $ % (In millions, except per share amounts) Consolidated operating income $ 430.0 $ 381.8 $ 439.0 $ 48.2 13 % $ (57.2 ) 13 % Consolidated other expense, net (54.8 ) (50.8 ) (65.1 ) (4.0 ) 8 % 14.3 22 % Consolidated provision for income taxes (131.9 ) (106.6 ) (119.0 ) (25.3 ) 24 % 12.4 10 % Consolidated net income from continuing operations $ 243.3 $ 224.4 $ 254.9 $ 18.9 8 % $ (30.5 ) 12 % Discontinued operations, net of tax $ 31.5 $ 16.1 $ 24.1 $ 15.4 94 % $ (8.0 ) 33 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (8.1 ) (6.6 ) (6.2 ) (1.5 ) 22 % (0.4 ) 6 % Net income attributable to Equifax $ 266.7 $ 233.9 $ 272.8 $ 32.8 14 % $ (38.9 ) 14 % Diluted earnings per common share Net income from continuing operations attributable to Equifax $ 1.86 $ 1.70 $ 1.91 $ 0.16 9 % $ (0.21 ) 11 % Discontinued operations attributable to Equifax 0.25 0.13 0.18 $ 0.12 92 % $ (0.05 ) 28 % Net income attributable to Equifax $ 2.11 $ 1.83 $ 2.09 $ 0.28 15 % $ (0.26 ) 12 % Weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share 126.5 127.9 130.4 The increase in net income attributable to Equifax for 2010, as compared to 2009, was primarily due to increased income from discontinued operations, driven by a $14.9 million gain, net of tax, on the sale of DMS recorded in the third quarter of 2010 and a $12.3 million gain, net of tax, on the sale of the APPRO product line recorded in the second quarter of 2010. Net income attributed to Equifax for 2010 also benefited from higher operating income, which grew generally in line with higher revenue. The decrease in net income for 2009, as compared to 2008, was a function of lower operating income in three of our five businesses and $8.0 million of additional restructuring charges in 2009, partially offset by increased income from our TALX and North America Commercial Solutions segments and lower interest expense. 32 Segment Financial Results U.S. Consumer Information Solutions Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 U.S. Consumer Information Solutions 2010 2009 2008 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Operating revenue: Online Consumer Information Solutions $ 485.2 $ 501.4 $ 566.5 $ (16.2 ) 3 % $ (65.1 ) 11 % Mortgage Solutions 113.5 99.5 70.2 14.0 14 % 29.3 42 % Consumer Financial Marketing Services 144.3 111.3 132.0 33.0 30 % (20.7 ) 16 % Total operating revenue $ 743.0 $ 712.2 $ 768.7 $ 30.8 4 % $ (56.5 ) 7 % % of consolidated revenue 40 % 41 % 42 % Total operating income $ 269.8 $ 259.4 $ 298.9 $ 10.4 4 % $ (39.5 ) 13 % Operating margin 36.3 % 36.4 % 38.9 % 0.1 pts 2.5 pts U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue increased 4% in 2010 as compared to 2009 as growth in Mortgage Solutions along with growth due to our acquisition of IXI Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2009 was partially offset by a small decline in online credit reporting revenue. The decrease in revenue for 2009, as compared to 2008, was mainly due to continued weakness in the U.S. credit and retail economy, offset by growth in the Mortgage Solutions business due to increased activity associated with our settlement services products and increased mortgage refinancing activity in 2009 and 2010. OCIS. Revenue for 2010, as compared to 2009, declined primarily due to a reduction of online credit decision transaction volume of 5% caused by weakness in the U.S. consumer credit markets while pricing remained relatively flat year over year. Revenue for 2009, as compared to the prior year, declined primarily due to a reduction of online credit decision transaction volume as consumer lending activity was lower than in 2008. The 18% decline in volume for 2009, from the prior year, was partially offset by a 4% increase in average revenue per transaction. This increase was attributable to a disproportionate decline in volume from large national accounts which are generally billed at a lower average price per transaction. Mortgage Solutions. Revenue for 2010 has increased, as compared to the prior year, due to favorable long term interest rates that have resulted in higher consumer refinancing activity and increased home sales activity attributable to U.S. government incentives for housing purchases which expired on May 31, 2010. The 2009 increase in revenue, as compared to 2008, is due to increased activity associated with growth in demand for our settlement services products which resulted in increased revenue of $16.5 million over 2008, higher volumes of mortgage credit reporting related to increased refinance activity and incremental revenue from our acquisition of certain assets of a small mortgage credit reporting reseller. Consumer Financial Marketing Services. The increase in revenue in 2010, as compared to 2009, was primarily due to our acquisition of IXI Corporation during the fourth quarter of 2009. Revenue decreased in 2009 as compared to 2008 as banks and other market participants reduced prescreen marketing volumes and negotiated lower prices for portfolio management services at a time of significant uncertainty in the consumer credit market. This decline was partially offset by approximately $6 million of incremental revenue from our acquisition of IXI Corporation in October 2009. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions Operating Margin. Operating margin remained relatively consistent in 2010, as compared to 2009. The margin impact of amortization expense associated with the IXI acquisition was offset by expense leveraging resulting from revenue growth and expense reductions due to certain process streamlining activities. Operating margin decreased for 2009, as compared to 2008, mainly due to revenue declines described above in our OCIS and Consumer Financial Marketing Services businesses. Our operating expenses generally do not decline at the same rate as our revenue due to a high portion of costs that are fixed rather than variable in the short term. The overall decline in revenue was partially offset by lower personnel costs due to headcount reductions, process efficiencies and lower technology outsourcing costs. The increases in revenue from our core mortgage and settlement services products also contributed to the USCIS margin decline as these products have higher variable costs and lower margins than traditional online database products. 33 International Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 International 2010 2009 2008 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Operating revenue: Latin America $ 231.3 $ 200.4 $ 219.9 $ 30.9 15 % $ (19.5 ) 9 % Europe 137.6 138.4 175.0 (0.8 ) 1 % (36.6 ) 21 % Canada Consumer 113.9 99.8 110.8 14.1 14 % (11.0 ) 10 % Total operating revenue $ 482.8 $ 438.6 $ 505.7 $ 44.2 10 % $ (67.1 ) 13 % % of consolidated revenue 26 % 26 % 28 % Total operating income $ 119.4 $ 118.9 $ 149.9 $ 0.5 0 % $ (31.0 ) 21 % Operating margin 24.7 % 27.1 % 29.6 % 2.4 pts 2.5 pts International revenue increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily due to strong growth in Latin America and the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Local currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted our International revenue by $21.8 million, or 5%. In local currency, International revenue was up 5% in 2010. For 2009, as compared to 2008, revenue decreased primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation and secondarily due to global economic weakness affecting several of our larger international country operations. Local currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our 2009 International revenue by $47.2 million, or 9%. In local currency, 2009 revenue was down 4%, as compared to the same period a year ago. Latin America. Revenue increased for 2010, as compared to the prior year by $30.9 million, or 15%, partially due to the favorable foreign currency impact of $14.3 million, or 7%. In local currency, revenue increased 8% from 2009. Local currency revenue increased in most of our Latin American geographies, resulting from broad based growth across all product segments, partially offset by a modest decline in Brazil. Revenue declined for 2009, as compared to the prior year, due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $18.9 million, or 9%. In local currency, 2009 revenue was approximately flat when compared to 2008. Local currency revenue declines in Brazil and Chile were offset by increased revenue in our other Latin American geographies resulting from increased volumes for our collection services and decisioning technology products. The revenue declines in Brazil and Chile were mainly due to lower volumes related to our online solutions, marketing products and decisioning technologies, resulting primarily from competitive factors in these geographies. Europe. The slight decrease in revenue for 2010, as compared to 2009, was due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $3.2 million, or 3%. In local currency, revenue increased 2%, as compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was due to growth in online transactions and a higher volume of subscriptions in the U.K. as well as higher registries usage in Spain and Portugal offset by declines in some of our other product segments. The decline in revenue for 2009, as compared to the prior year, was partially due to the unfavorable foreign currency impact of $21.3 million, or 12%. In local currency, revenue declined 9% for 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008. The local currency declines were due to decreased volume in the U.K. caused by weakness in the U.K. economy affecting customer demand, which was partially offset by higher volumes and new customers for our online services and new collections products in Spain and Portugal. Canada Consumer. The $14.1 million increase in revenue for 2010, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to favorable foreign currency impact of $10.6 million, or 11%. In local currency, revenue increased 3% when compared to 2009. The increase in local currency was due to increased volumes for our technology and analytical services products primarily due to growth in the customer base for a new fraud mitigation product. The decline in revenue for 2009, as compared to the prior year, was partially due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $7.0 million, or 6%. In local currency, revenue declined 4% for 2009, as compared to 2008. The decline in local currency was due to lower volumes related to our online solutions and marketing products resulting from weakness in the economy, partially offset by increased volumes for our analytical and decisioning technology products. 34 International Operating Margin. Operating margin decreased for 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily due to a shift in product mix and increased operating expenses. Operating expenses increased 8% for 2010, in local currency, when compared to 2009, due to increased revenue and expense investments in new product development and increased sales force, particularly in Brazil. Operating margin decreased for 2009, as compared to 2008, due to the revenue declines discussed above. Operating expenses decreased 1% for 2009, in local currency, when compared to 2008, compared to a 4% decline in revenue in local currency. TALX Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 TALX 2010 2009 2008 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Operating Revenue: The Work Number $ 209.1 $ 158.2 $ 131.9 $ 50.9 32 % $ 26.3 20 % Tax and Talent Management 186.5 188.2 173.2 (1.7 ) 1 % 15.0 9 % Total operating revenue $ 395.6 $ 346.4 $ 305.1 $ 49.2 14 % $ 41.3 14 % % of consolidated revenue 21 % 20 % 16 % Total operating income $ 92.1 $ 75.4 $ 53.1 $ 16.7 22 % $ 22.3 42 % Operating margin 23.3 % 21.8 % 17.4 % 1.5 pts 4.4 pts The Work Number. Revenue from The Work Number increased $50.9 million, or 32%, in 2010 compared to 2009 due to mid double digit growth from traditional employment based verification and complementary services, with strong demand across each of the mortgage, pre employment screening, social services and collections sectors; and due to the impact of our acquisition of Rapid Reporting Verification Company in the fourth quarter of 2009. Revenue increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due to the increased volumes of verifications of consumer employment from government service agencies, who use our services to approve benefits to consumers under certain government programs, and verifications of employment and income by financial institutions, who confirm consumer data for use in underwriting decisions. Our acquisition of Rapid Reporting Verification Company in November 2009 provided approximately $5 million of incremental revenue. Tax and Talent Management Services. The decrease in revenue during 2010, as compared to the prior year, resulted primarily from expected declines in our Tax Management Services business driven primarily by decreases in unemployment compensation claims activity, partially offset by revenue growth in our Talent Management Services business due to increased government hiring activity at the U.S. Transportation and Security Administration and other large government customers. The increase in revenue during 2009, as compared to 2008, resulted from growth in our Tax Management Services business driven primarily by increased unemployment compensation claims activity due to the high levels of unemployment in the U.S., partially offset by declines in volume from our Talent Management Services business during the first half of the year, as demand was negatively impacted by reduced hiring activity by employers, particularly governmental agencies who are key clients, caused by the weakened economy and budgetary pressures. TALX Operating Margin. Operating margin increased 150 basis points for 2010, as compared to 2009, and 440 basis points in 2009, as compared to 2008, due to continued revenue growth, while operating expenses grew at a slower rate due to the leveraging of certain fixed operational and overhead costs and certain operating process efficiencies for both periods. North America Personal Solutions Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 North America Personal Solutions 2010 2009 2008 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Total operating revenue $ 157.6 $ 149.0 $ 162.6 $ 8.6 6 % $ (13.6 ) 8 % % of consolidated revenue 9 % 9 % 9 % Total operating income $ 44.6 $ 34.3 $ 46.3 $ 10.3 30 % $ (12.0 ) 26 % Operating margin 28.3 % 23.0 % 28.4 % 5.3 pts 5.4 pts 35 The increase in revenue for 2010, as compared to 2009, was primarily due to increased direct to customer, Equifax branded subscription service revenue, which was up 11% from 2009, driven by higher average revenue per subscriber due to new product offerings and better market segmentation. The increase in subscription revenue was partially offset by lower transaction sales and lower corporate breach revenues. The operating margin increase was primarily due to the revenue growth and operating efficiencies. Revenue declined for 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to lower transaction sales, as a result of lower levels of new consumer credit activity, and lower corporate data breach revenues. These declines were partially offset by direct to consumer, Equifax branded subscription service revenue, which was up 4% for 2009, as compared to the prior year, driven by higher new sales and higher average revenue per subscription, reflecting additional features in the Equifax offering. Total subscription customers, including direct to consumer Equifax branded services and subscriptions related to data breach offers, were 1.0 million at December 31, 2009. The operating margin decline in 2009, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to the revenue decline discussed above, as well as increased advertising expenses, as the Company introduced a 2009 television advertising program in order to increase direct subscription sales.

The favorable impact of changes in the U.S. Canadian foreign exchange rate increased revenue by $2.3 million, or 3%. In local currency, revenue increased 12% in 2010 compared to the prior year. The local currency increase was primarily due to increases in U.S. risk and marketing service revenue and revenue from our data management products. Online transaction volume for U.S. commercial credit information products for 2010 increased when compared to the prior year. Operating margin increased for 2010, as compared to 2009, as the rapid rate in revenue growth exceeded growth in operating expenses. Revenue declined for 2009, as compared to the prior year, due to the unfavorable impact of changes in the U.S. Canadian foreign exchange rate of $1.7 million, or 2%. In local currency, 2009 revenue was flat when compared to 2008. Revenue declines in the U.S. and Canadian risk and marketing service revenues attributed to weakness in the U.S. and Canadian economies were offset by increased revenue from our data management products. Online transaction volume for U.S. commercial credit information products decreased 21% for 2009, as compared to the prior year, due to a slowdown in loan origination to small businesses. Operating margin increased for 2009, as compared to 2008, mainly due to reduced operating expenses resulting from lower personnel costs and discretionary expenses. General Corporate Expense Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 General Corporate Expense 2010 2009 2008 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) General corporate expense $ 115.4 $ 121.3 $ 122.8 $ (5.9 ) 5 % $ (1.5 ) 1 % Our general corporate expenses are costs that are incurred at the corporate level and include those expenses impacted by corporate direction, such as shared services, administrative, legal, equity compensation costs and restructuring expenses. General corporate expenses decreased for 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily as a result of $24.8 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2009 that did not recur in 2010. This was partially offset by increased salary, benefit and incentive costs, upgrades in shared corporate technology, and acquisition related expenses. General corporate expenses decreased slightly for 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily as a result of reduced incentive costs, lower legal and professional fees and reduced occupancy costs. This was partially offset by $8.0 million of additional restructuring charges recorded during 2009, as well as increased insurance costs. Total 2009 restructuring charges of $24.8 million related primarily to headcount reductions. 36 LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. We continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remain in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing our capital structure to meet short and long term objectives. Sources and Uses of Cash Funds generated by operating activities and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity. We believe that funds generated from expected results of operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements (such as capital expenditures, interest payments, potential pension funding contributions, dividend payments and stock repurchases, if any) for the foreseeable future. Since the beginning of 2009, credit market conditions have improved and we have primarily shifted our short term borrowings to our commercial paper program. In the event that credit market conditions were to deteriorate, we would rely more heavily on borrowings as needed under our Senior Credit Facility described below. At December 31, 2010, $848.3 million was available to borrow under our Senior Credit Facility. Our Senior Credit Facility does not include a provision under which lenders could refuse to allow us to borrow under this facility in the event of a material adverse change in our financial condition, as long as we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the lending agreement. On February 18, 2011, we extended the maturity date and reduced the borrowing limits of our existing unsecured revolving credit facility dated as of July 24, 2006, as amended (the Senior Credit Facility) with a group of lenders by entering into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of February 18, 2011 (the Amended Agreement). The Senior Credit Facility had been scheduled to expire on July 24, 2011, and provided $850 million of borrowing capacity. The Amended Agreement provides for a maturity date of February 18, 2015. We elected to reduce the size of the facility to $500 million in line with our liquidity needs and reflecting credit market conditions, including higher upfront fees and fees for unused borrowing availability. The Amended Agreement also provides an accordion feature that allows us to request an increase in the total commitment amount to $750 million should we so choose. We added certain of our subsidiaries in Canada and Luxembourg as co borrowers in addition to the Company and our U.K. subsidiary to provide additional flexibility as to the place of borrowing. The Amended Agreement revises certain other terms of the existing credit agreement, including pricing, to reflect current market conditions. The pricing grid for the Senior Credit Facility, which is based on our applicable credit ratings at the time of any borrowing, was increased. Based on our current credit ratings, the unused facility fee as of the closing date increased from 8 to 20 basis points, and the margin for base rate or LIBOR rate loans and letters of credit as of the closing date increased from 32 to 150 basis points. The Amended Agreement did not change the existing financial covenant which requires us to maintain, on a rolling four quarter basis, a maximum leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA as defined in the Amended Agreement) not to exceed 3.5 to 1.0. On February 18, 2011, we correspondingly reduced the size of our commercial paper program (the CP Program), which is supported by the Senior Credit Facility, from $850 million to $500 million. Fund Transfer Limitations. The ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited, in some cases, by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments; these restrictions do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness, meet our current obligations or pay dividends. Information about our cash flows, by category, is presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: 37 Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Net cash provided by (used in): 2010 2009 2008 $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Operating activities $ 352.6 $ 418.4 $ 448.1 $ (65.8 ) 16 % $ (29.7 ) 7 % Investing activities $ 1.0 $ (270.1 ) $ (141.6 ) $ 271.1 nm $ (128.5 ) nm Financing activities $ (335.3 ) $ (108.3 ) $ (319.1 ) $ (227.0 ) nm $ 210.8 nm nm not meaningful Operating Activities The decrease in operating cash flow for 2010 was primarily driven by $35.0 million of additional pension contributions; a $16.4 million net impact on use of funds as accounts receivable, which had been reduced in 2009, grew in 2010 as revenue grew; and $42.0 million in taxes paid on the sale of DMS and the APPRO product line. These, and other lesser changes in assets and liabilities, more than offset increased net income and the contribution from higher depreciation and amortization. The decrease in operating cash flow for 2009 was primarily driven by $38.5 million of lower consolidated net income described above and $29.3 million of pension contributions in 2009 with no similar payments made in 2008. These items were partially offset by year to year reduction in days sales outstanding in trade receivables and increases in operating liabilities as reduced levels of accruals in 2008 did not recur. Fund Transfer Limitations. The ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited, in some cases, by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments; these restrictions do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness, meet our current obligations or pay dividends. Investing Activities Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Net cash used in: 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (Dollars in millions) Capital expenditures $ 99.8 $ 70.7 $ 110.5 $ 29.1 $ (39.8 ) Our capital expenditures are used for developing, enhancing and deploying new and existing software in support of our expanding product set, replacing or adding equipment, updating systems for regulatory compliance, the licensing of software applications and investing in system reliability, security and disaster recovery enhancements. Capital expenditures in 2010 were higher than 2009 due to the purchase of our headquarters building in Atlanta, GA. On February 27, 2009, we notified the lessor of our headquarters building that we intended to exercise our purchase option in accordance with the lease terms. We purchased the building for $29.0 million on February 26, 2010. The notice of our intent to exercise our purchase option caused us to account for this lease obligation as a capital lease. We recorded the building and the related obligation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2009. For additional information regarding our headquarters building lease, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Capital expenditures in 2009 were less than 2008, due to significant data center infrastructure improvements that were substantially completed in 2008. We expect capital expenditures in 2011 to be in the range of $75 million to $95 million, as we continue to invest for growth. 38 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Investments Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Net cash used in: 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (Dollars in millions) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired $ (82.6 ) $ (196.0 ) $ (27.4 ) $ 113.4 $ (168.6 ) Proceeds received from divestitures $ 181.7 $ $ $ 181.7 $ Investment in unconsolidated affiliates, net $ 1.7 $ (3.4 ) $ (3.7 ) $ 5.1 $ 0.3 2010 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Investments. On October 1, 2010, we acquired Anakam, Inc., a provider of large scale, software based, multi factor authentication solutions for $64.3 million. The results of this acquisition are included in our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions segment. To further enhance our market share, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, we completed four acquisitions totaling $12.3 million, net of cash acquired. These transactions were in our International segment and the results of these acquisitions are not material. During 2010, we resolved a contingent earn out associated with a 2008 acquisition included in our TALX segment. The earn out of $6 million was measured on the completion of 2009 revenue targets and was accrued at December 31, 2009. On April 23, 2010, we sold our Equifax Enabling Technologies LLC legal entity, consisting of our APPRO loan origination software business (APPRO) for approximately $72 million. On July 1, 2010, we sold the assets of our Direct Marketing Services division (DMS) for approximately $117 million. Both of these were previously reported in our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions segment. We have presented the APPRO and DMS operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The discontinued operations are further described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. 2009 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Investments. On December 23, 2009, as a part of our long term growth strategy of expanding into emerging markets, we formed a joint venture, Equifax Credit Information Services Private Limited, or ECIS, to provide a broad range of credit data and information solutions in India. We paid cash consideration of $5.2 million for our 49 percent equity interest in ECIS. On November 2, 2009, to further enhance our income and identity verification service offerings, we acquired Rapid Reporting Verification Company, a provider of IRS tax transcript information and social security number authentication services, for $72.5 million. The results of this acquisition have been included in our TALX operating segment subsequent to the acquisition. On October 27, 2009, we acquired IXI Corporation, a provider of consumer wealth and asset data, for $124.0 million. This acquisition enables us to offer more differentiated and in depth consumer income, wealth and other data to help our clients improve their marketing, collections, portfolio management and customer management efforts across different product segments. The results of this acquisition have been included in our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions operating segment subsequent to the acquisition date. We financed these purchases through borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility, which were subsequently refinanced through the issuance in November 2009 of our 4.45%, five year unsecured Senior Notes. The 4.45% Senior Notes are further described in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. On August 12, 2009, in order to enhance our Mortgage Solutions business market share, we acquired certain assets and specified liabilities of a small mortgage credit reporting reseller for cash consideration of $3.8 million. The results of this acquisition have been included in our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions segment subsequent to the acquisition date. 39 2008 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Investments. To further enhance our market share and grow our credit data business, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, we completed nine acquisitions and investments in a number of small businesses totaling $27.4 million, net of cash acquired. Six of the transactions were in our International segment, two within our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions segment and one within our TALX segment. We recorded a $6.0 million liability at December 31, 2009, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, for the contingent earn out payment associated with the acquired company within the TALX segment. The earn out payment was measured on the completion of 2009 revenue targets and will be paid in 2010. On June 30, 2008, as a part of our long term growth strategy of entering new geographies, we acquired a 28 percent equity interest in Global Payments Credit Services LLC, or GPCS, a credit information company in Russia, for cash consideration of $4.4 million, which is now doing business as Equifax Credit Services, LLC in Russia. Under our shareholders agreement, we have the option to acquire up to an additional 22 percent interest in GPCS between 2011 and 2013 for cash consideration based on a formula for determining equity value of the business and the assumption of certain debt, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. For additional information about our acquisitions, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Financing Activities Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Net cash provided by (used in): 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (Dollars in millions) Net short term (repayments) borrowings $ (134.0 ) $ 101.8 $ (184.8 ) $ (235.8 ) $ 286.6 Net borrowings (repayments) under long term revolving credit facilities $ (5.0 ) $ (415.2 ) $ 45.0 $ 410.2 $ (460.2 ) Payments on long term debt $ (20.8 ) $ (31.8 ) $ (17.8 ) $ 11.0 $ (14.0 ) Proceeds from issuance of long term debt $ $ 274.4 $ 2.3 $ (274.4 ) $ 272.1 Credit Facility Availability. Our principal unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks, which we refer to as the Senior Credit Facility, permitted us to borrow up to $850.0 million through July 2011. The Senior Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes. Availability of the Senior Credit Facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and, pursuant to our existing Board of Directors authorization, by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper notes, or CP. The Senior Credit Facility was scheduled to expire in July 2011. As noted above, on February 18, 2011, we extended the maturity date to February 18, 2015 and reduced the borrowing limits of the Senior Credit Facility from $850.0 million to $500.0 million pursuant to the Amended Agreement. Our $850.0 million CP program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of CP with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days. We may use the proceeds of CP for general corporate purposes. On February 18, 2011, under the terms of the Amended Agreement, we correspondingly reduced the size of the CP Program, which is supported by the Senior Credit Facility, from $850 million to $500 million. In June 2010, we amended our 364 day revolving credit agreement with a Canadian bank (our Canadian Credit Facility), to reduce the borrowing limit from C$20.0 million to C$10.0 million (denominated in Canadian dollars) and extending its maturity through June 2011. Borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2010, no amounts were outstanding under our Senior Credit Facility, CP program or Canadian Credit Facility. At December 31, 2010, a total of $858.3 million was available under our committed credit facilities. At December 31, 2010, approximately 72% of our debt was fixed rate debt and 28% was effectively variable rate debt. Our variable rate debt, consisting of our five year senior notes due 2014 (against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates), generally bears interest based on a specified margin plus a base rate (LIBOR) or on CP rates for investment grade issuers. The interest rates reset periodically, depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements. At December 31, 2010, interest rates on our variable rate debt were 2.1%. Borrowing and Repayment Activity. Net short term borrowings (repayments) primarily represent activity under our CP program, as well as activity under our Canadian short term revolving credit agreement. Net (repayments) borrowings under long term revolving credit facilities relates to activity on our Senior Credit Facility. We primarily borrow under our CP program, when available. 40 The change in net short term (repayments) borrowings in 2010 primarily reflects the net repayment of $134.0 million of CP notes since December 31, 2009. Net short term borrowings in 2009 primarily reflects the net issuance of $132.0 million of CP notes, offset by the repayment of $25.8 million under our Canadian Credit Facility in 2009. Net short term (repayments) in 2008 reflects the net repayment of $216.5 million of the balance outstanding on our CP notes, offset by the increase of $25.8 million in borrowings under our Canadian Credit Facility. The change in net (repayments) borrowings for 2010 under long term revolving credit facilities represents the 2009 repayment of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2008, under our Senior Credit Facility as we decreased our use of CP to fund our capital needs in 2009 and 2010. The 2009 repayment of these borrowing drove the increase in net (repayments) borrowings for 2009. In 2008, the net borrowing activity under long term revolving credit facilities primarily represents our pay down of $216.5 million of CP outstanding at December 31, 2007 from cash from operations and borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility to lower the average cost of our debt and due to the adverse conditions in the CP market. In 2009, we purchased $7.5 million principal amount of our outstanding ten year senior notes due 2017 for $6.3 million and $25.0 million principal amount of our outstanding debentures due 2028 for $25.1 million. During 2008, we purchased $20.0 million principal amount of the ten year senior notes due 2017 for $14.3 million. On November 4, 2009, we issued $275.0 million principal amount of 4.45%, five year senior notes in an underwritten public offering. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes to repay amounts outstanding under our CP program, a portion of which was used to finance our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions. In conjunction with our 2009 sale of five year senior notes, we entered into five year interest rate swaps, designated as fair value hedges, which convert the debts fixed interest rate to a variable rate. Debt Covenants. Our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. In addition, our Senior Credit Facility and Canadian Credit Facility each require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 3.5 to 1.0, and limit the amount of subsidiary debt. Our leverage ratio was 1.71 at December 31, 2010. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and, as of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. We do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our outstanding debt; however, our senior notes, discussed above, contain change in control provisions. If we experience a change of control or publicly announce our intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by Standard & Poors, or S&P, and Moodys Investors Service, or Moodys, below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof, then we will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Credit Ratings. Credit ratings reflect an independent agencys judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrowers industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a companys cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, S&P and Moodys, use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moodys, respectively. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Long term ratings of BBB and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moodys, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. At December 31, 2010, the long term ratings for our obligations were BBB+ and Baa1, which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at December 31, 2009. A downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our CP program and credit facilities, and could limit, or in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude our ability to issue CP. If our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt. In addition, the markets demand for, and thus our ability to readily issue, new debt could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment. 41 For additional information about our debt, including the terms of our financing arrangements, basis for variable interest rates and debt covenants, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Equity Transactions Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Net cash provided by (used in): 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (Dollars in millions) Treasury stock purchases $ (167.5 ) $ (23.8 ) $ (155.7 ) $ (143.7 ) $ 131.9 Dividends paid to Equifax shareholders $ (35.2 ) $ (20.2 ) $ (20.5 ) $ (15.0 ) $ 0.3 Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests $ (5.1 ) $ (4.0 ) $ (3.4 ) $ (1.1 ) $ (0.6 ) Proceeds from exercise of stock options $ 29.3 $ 10.2 $ 14.7 $ 19.1 $ (4.5 ) Excess tax benefits from stock based compensation plans $ 3.5 $ 1.3 $ 2.1 $ 2.2 $ (0.8 ) Sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Under share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors, we purchased 5.2 million, 0.9 million, and 4.5 million common shares on the open market during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for $167.5 million, $23.8 million and $155.7 million, respectively, at an average price per common share of $32.28, $26.41 and $34.41, respectively. At December 31, 2010, the Company had $104.5 million remaining for stock repurchases under the existing Board authorization. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we paid cash dividends to Equifax shareholders of $35.2 million, $20.2 million and $20.5 million, respectively, at $0.28 per share for 2010 and $0.16 per share for 2009 and 2008. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010. The table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time. Some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table. Payments due by Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years Thereafter (In millions) Debt (including capitalized lease obligation) (1) $ 990.2 $ 19.9 $ 32.8 $ 290.0 $ 647.5 Operating leases (2) 95.3 17.9 26.3 13.1 38.0 Data processing, outsourcing agreements and other purchase obligations (3) 236.8 88.5 129.8 9.9 8.6 Other long term liabilities (4) (6) 98.1 7.3 13.2 8.8 68.8 Interest payments (5) 761.3 54.0 104.2 93.2 509.9 $ 2,181.7 $ 187.6 $ 306.3 $ 415.0 $ 1,272.8 (1) The amounts are gross of unamortized discounts totaling $2.1 million and fair value adjustments of $11.5 million at December 31, 2010. Total debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is net of the unamortized discounts and fair value adjustments. (2) Our operating lease obligations principally involve office space and equipment, which include the ground lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in 2048. (3) These agreements primarily represent our minimum contractual obligations for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions, and certain administrative functions. These agreements expire between 2011 and 2014. 42 (4) These long term liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension, postretirement and other compensation related plans, some of which are discounted in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. We made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments. In the table above, we have not included amounts related to future pension plan obligations, as such required funding amounts beyond 2010 have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance. During January 2011, we made a $10.0 million discretionary contribution to fund our U.S. Retirement Income Plan. (5) For future interest payments on variable rate debt, which are generally based on a specified margin plus a base rate (LIBOR) or on CP rates for investment grade issuers, we used the variable rate in effect at December 31, 2010 to calculate these payments. Our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010, consisted of CP, borrowings under our credit facilities and our five year senior notes due 2014 (against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates). Future interest payments related to our Senior Credit Facility and our CP program are based on the borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2010 through their respective maturity dates, assuming such borrowings are outstanding until that time. The variable portion of the rate at December 31, 2010 was 2.1% for all of our variable rate debt. Future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates. (6) This table excludes $27.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. A potential significant future use of cash would be the payment to Computer Sciences Corporation, or CSC, if it were to exercise its option to sell its credit reporting business to us at any time prior to 2013. The option exercise price would be determined by agreement or by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option. We estimate that if the option had been exercised at December 31, 2010, the price range would have been approximately $625 million to $700 million. This estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business, current market conditions and other factors, all of which are subject to constant change. Therefore, the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than our estimate. Our agreement with CSC, which expires on July 31, 2018, also provides us with an option to purchase its credit reporting business if it does not elect to renew the agreement or if there is a change in control of CSC while the agreement is in effect. If CSC were to exercise its option, or if we were able to and decided to exercise our option, then we would have to obtain additional sources of funding. We believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the capital markets for debt and or equity financing. However, the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors, including credit market conditions, the state of the equity markets, general economic conditions, our credit ratings and our financial performance and condition. 43 Off Balance Sheet Transactions We do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds, we transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with costs of $47.9 million and $35.7 million, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, to a local governmental authority in the U.S. to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development. The title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds. These fixed assets are still recognized in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the Company. Letters of Credit and Guarantees We will from time to time issue standby letters of credit, performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business. The aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at December 31, 2010, and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less. Guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units. The maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at December 31, 2010. Benefit Plans Prior to December 31, 2009, we had one non contributory qualified retirement plan covering most U.S. salaried employees (the Equifax Inc. Pension Plan, or EIPP), a qualified retirement plan that covered U.S. salaried employees (the U.S. Retirement Income Plan, or USRIP) who terminated or retired before January 1, 2005 and a defined benefit plan for most salaried and hourly employees in Canada (the Canadian Retirement Income Plan, or CRIP). On December 31, 2009, the plan assets and obligations of the EIPP were merged with the USRIP. The USRIP remained as the sole U.S. qualified retirement plan. At December 31, 2010, the USRIP met or exceeded ERISAs minimum funding requirements. In January 2011, we made a contribution of $10.0 million to the USRIP. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, we made contributions of $50.0 million to the USRIP. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, we made contributions of $15.0 million to the EIPP. We also contributed $1.6 and $1.8 million to the CRIP during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Equifax Employee Benefits Trust contributed $12.5 million to the EIPP upon dissolution of the Trust in 2009. In the future, we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions, depending on certain circumstances, including market conditions and liquidity needs. We believe additional funding contributions, if any, would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs, which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and our credit facilities. For our non U.S., tax qualified retirement plans, we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations. For the non qualified supplementary retirement plans, we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants, but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with GAAP. For additional information about our benefit plans, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Seasonality We experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams. Revenue generated from The Work Number business unit within the TALX operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of Form W 2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year. Revenue from our OCIS and Mortgage Solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions, most commonly the second and third calendar quarters. 44 Effects of Inflation and Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Equifaxs operating results are not materially affected by inflation, although inflation may result in increases in the Companys expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments, it may adversely affect the Companys financial position and profitability. A significant portion of the Companys business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of non U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored. We generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates, although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. This requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. In addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Income. We also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results. For additional information about these policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured, the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our processing of transactions related to the provision of information services to our customers, in which case revenue is recognized, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, when the services are provided. A smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscription based contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period, generally one year. Revenue related to subscription based contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided, using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed. Any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contracts subscription period. Revenue related to subscription based contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term. Revenue is recorded net of sales taxes. If at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment. If there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. If at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. 45 The determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears. In these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual reported volumes reported in the past. Differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported. We have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past. We monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future. If we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates, revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained. Also within our TALX operating segment, the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients. Revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones, upon calculation of the credit, or when the credit is utilized by our client, depending on the provisions of the client contract. We have certain information solution offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements. The multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information, file updates for certain solutions, services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel, training services, statistical models and other services. To account for each of these elements separately, the delivered elements must have stand alone value to our customer, and there must exist objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for any undelivered elements. If we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting, we apply one of the accounting policies described above. This may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer. Many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments. No individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or, in most cases, purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement. Some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases. These development services do not meet the requirement for having stand alone value, thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service. Revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We have some multiple element arrangements that include software. We recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery, in accordance with the applicable guidance. We record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction. The direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract. Deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales of our information services relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having stand alone value discussed above. Deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies. Judgments and uncertainties Each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables. These considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value; concluding when the element will be delivered; and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services. 46 In addition, the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears. In these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past. Differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported. Effects if actual results differ from assumptions We have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past. We monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future. If we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates, revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future, we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets We review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually (as of September 30) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance or trends, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. We have nine reporting units comprised of Consumer Information Solutions (which includes Mortgage Solutions and Consumer Financial Marketing Services), Europe, Latin America, Canada Consumer, North America Personal Solutions, North America Commercial Solutions, The Work Number, Tax Management Services and Talent Management Services. The goodwill balance at December 31, 2010, for our nine reporting units was as follows: December 31, 2010 (In millions) Consumer Information Solutions (including Mortgage Solutions and Consumer Financial Marketing Services) $ 628.5 Europe 96.2 Latin America 219.8 Canada Consumer 30.9 North America Personal Solutions 1.8 North America Commercial Solutions 37.6 The Work Number 752.2 Tax Management Services 121.6 Talent Management Services 26.1 Total goodwill $ 1,914.7 Judgments and Uncertainties In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting units business enterprise value. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and long term revenue growth rates, operating margins for each reporting unit, discount rates, foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges. The assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, for benchmark companies. We believe the benchmark companies used for each of the reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks, participate in similar markets, provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly. The companies we use as benchmarks are outlined in our Competition discussion in Item I of this report. Data for the benchmark companies was obtained from publicly available information. Latin America has benchmark companies that conduct operations of businesses of a similar type and scope, such as Experian Group Limited and The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. The Work Number, Tax Management Services and Talent Management Services share a different set of benchmark companies, notably ADP and Paychex Inc., as the markets they serve are different than those served by our other reporting units. Valuation multiples were selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting units operating result with the comparable companies information. In addition to these financial considerations, qualitative factors such as variations in growth opportunities and overall risk among the benchmark companies were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple. 47 The values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting units fair value. We use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units. This approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach, with 70% of the value coming from the income approach. We believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations. The selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value. Judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value. We have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of the last annual impairment test. Growth Assumptions The assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance, the details of which are described in our Managements Discussion & Analysis of operating performance. Additionally, we consider the impact that known economic, industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts, as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives, client service and retention standards, and cost management programs. At the end of the forecast period, the long term growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of each reporting unit was generally 3% to 5% based on managements assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit, as well as broader economic considerations such as Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve. As a result of the economic downturn experienced in 2008 and 2009, and the resultant decline in revenue experienced in certain of our business units, in completing our 2010 impairment testing at September 30, 2010, we projected only modest revenue growth in 2011 for our reporting units based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these units. The anticipated revenue growth is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for a majority of our reporting units which reflect the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth. Our 2010 long term forecast anticipated slow but steady recovery of the global economy in 2011 which combined with our own strategic initiatives is expected to result in moderate revenue and cash flow growth. We also plan on continuing to take cost containment actions to help maintain operating margins for our reporting units. 48 Discount Rate Assumptions We utilize a weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. We believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed. To calculate the WACC, the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures. The cost of equity was computed using the Capital Asset Pricing Model which considers the risk free interest rate, beta, equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit. The cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the Companys tax rate. For the 2010 annual goodwill impairment evaluation, the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the reporting units ranged from 10% to 16%. Because of assigned market premiums, discount rates are lowest for reporting units, whose cash flows are expected to be less volatile due to such factors as the maturity of the market they serve, their position in that market or other macroeconomic factors. Where there is the greatest volatility of cash flows due to the degree of maturity or predictability of a business, competition, or participation in less stable geographic markets, such as our Latin America reporting unit, the discount rate selected is in the higher portion of the range as there is more inherent risk in the expected cash flows of that reporting unit. Estimated Fair Value and Sensitivities The estimated fair value of the reporting units whose fair value was calculated for purposes of the 2010 impairment testing is derived from the valuation techniques described above, incorporating the related projections and assumptions. An indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity. The estimated fair value for all reporting units exceeded the carrying value of these units as of September 30, 2010. As a result, no goodwill impairment was recorded. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions; therefore, in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. For example, an increase in the discount rate and decline in the cumulative cash flow projections of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below their carrying value. We perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. Ultimately, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. The excess of fair value over carrying value for the Companys reporting units that were valued as of September 30, 2010, ranged from approximately 15% to 76%. The Work Number revenues have been strong historically, having grown at a double digit compound annual growth rate since our acquisition of the reporting unit on May 17, 2007, therefore revenue growth is expected to continue for each of the years used in the preparation of the discounted cash flows. The actual growth rate for The Work Number would have to decline to a compounded rate of 5% growth, with all other factors held constant, for the reporting units fair value to drop below its carrying value. However, in the event that the revenue growth rate was to decline, management would take action to preserve operating margins. If the fair value dropped below carrying value, we would compare the carrying value of the goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill to determine if a goodwill impairment charge would become necessary. The calculated percentage excess in the Latin America reporting unit, at approximately 15%, reflects in part the effect of the uncertain economic and competitive conditions in Latin America on our actual and projected financial performance. The projections used in the calculation of fair value reflect our assumption of moderate economic growth in most of these countries, increases in revenue from the addition of sales staff and from new product and new customer segment initiatives, and our planned spending on operating improvement initiatives in 2011 to drive improving growth and profitability, particularly in Brazil, followed by growth for all of Latin America in 2012. If our operating improvement initiatives are not successful, there could be a change in the valuation of our goodwill in future periods and may possibly result in the recognition of an impairment loss. 49 The reporting unit having the lowest absolute dollar excess of fair value over carrying value is our Talent Management Services business which has a goodwill balance of $26.1 million as of September 30, 2010. This reporting unit has been impacted by uncertainty in government hiring activity and, as a result, we have lowered our revenue growth projections. While no impairment was noted in our impairment test as of September 30, 2010, if customer hiring activity does not increase in the near to medium term as forecast or if other events adversely impact the business drivers and corresponding assumptions used to value this reporting unit, there could be a change in the valuation of our goodwill in future periods and may possibly result in the recognition of an impairment loss. No new indications of impairment existed during the fourth quarter of 2010, thus no impairment testing was updated as of December 31, 2010. Effect if actual results differ from assumptions We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. Loss Contingencies We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business. We determine whether to disclose and or accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable, reasonably possible or remote. Judgments and uncertainties We periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for the estimated settlement costs. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible, but not probable, we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency. Our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective. Effect if actual results differ from assumptions We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies. However, if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates, we may be exposed to a loss that could be material. Income Taxes We record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid. We assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies. To the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable. Our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities. We record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations. We assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals. Judgments and uncertainties We consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets. These judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income, mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions, and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. We review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. These adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense. Settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash. At December 31, 2010, $27.9 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of which it is reasonably possible that up to $7.1 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months. 50 Effect if actual results differ from assumptions Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material. Pension and Other Postretirement Plans We consider accounting for our U.S. and Canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, which include discount rates, salary growth, expected return on plan assets, interest cost and mortality and retirement rates. Actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost. Judgments and uncertainties We believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are (1) the discount rate and (2) the expected return on plan assets. We determine our discount rates primarily based on high quality, fixed income investments and yield to maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date. Discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions. We use a publicly published yield curve to develop our discount rates. The yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated high quality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period, from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class, as provided by our external investment advisor. In setting the long term expected rate of return, management considers capital markets future expectations and the asset mix of the plan investments. Prior to 2008, the U.S. Pension Plans investment returns were 10.9%, 13.0% and 7.5% over three, five and ten years, respectively. The returns exceeded the S&P 500 returns for similar periods of time primarily due to an asset allocation strategy where large allocations to alternative asset classes (hedge fund of funds, private equity, real estate and real assets) provided consistently higher returns with a low correlation to equity market returns. These returns historically demonstrate a long term record of producing returns at or above the expected rate of return. However, the dramatic adverse market conditions in 2008 skewed the traditional measures of long term performance, such as the ten year average return. The severity of the 2008 losses, approximately negative 20%, makes the historical ten year average return a less accurate predictor of future return expectations. Our weighted average expected rate of return for 2011 is 7.75% which is the same as the 2010 expected rate. In 2009, the investment returns were approximately 16%, reflecting a partial recovery of the 2008 losses. Our weighted average expected rate of return declined from 8.02% in 2009 to approximately 7.75% for 2010 primarily related to the U.S. Retirement Income Plan which experienced lower growth due to our migration to a lower risk investment strategy, with increased allocation to lower risk/lower return asset classes, as well as the current forecast of expected future returns for our asset classes, which is lower than the prior year. Annual differences, if any, between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain. In calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss, we use a market related value of assets that smoothes actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years. The resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive. The market related value of our assets was $632.3 million at December 31, 2010. We do not expect our 2011 net periodic benefit cost, which includes the effect of the market related value of assets, to be materially different than our 2010 cost. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. Effect if actual results differ from assumptions We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material. Adjusting our expected long term rate of return (7.73% at December 31, 2010) by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2011 by approximately $3.1 million. Adjusting our weighted average discount rate (5.77% at December 31, 2010) by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2011 by approximately $1.1 million. 51 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of our business, we are exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, that could impact our results of operations and financial position. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities, and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge certain of these exposures. We use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk A substantial majority of our revenue, expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we do transact business in other currencies, primarily the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso and the Euro. For most of these foreign currencies, we are a net recipient, and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. We are required to translate, or express in U.S. dollars, the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable year end rate of exchange on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year. We record the resulting translation adjustment, and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a long term investment nature within other comprehensive income, as a component of our shareholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, which have historically been immaterial, are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates, although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency. For the year ended December 31, 2010, a 10% weaker U.S. dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2010 would have increased our revenue by $49.6 million and our pre tax operating profit by $13.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, a 10% weaker U.S. dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2009 would have increased our revenue by $45.2 million and our pre tax operating profit by $13.3 million. A 10% stronger U.S. dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pre tax operating profit for 2010 and 2009. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variable rate, long term Senior Credit Facility and commercial paper borrowings, as well as our interest rate swaps which economically convert our 2014 fixed rate bonds from a fixed rate of interest to a floating rate. We attempt to achieve the lowest all in weighted average cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt, and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt. At December 31, 2010, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.4% and weighted average life of debt was 11.9 years. At December 31, 2010, 72% of our debt was fixed rate, and the remaining 28% was variable rate. Occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps. A 100 basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt would have increased our 2010 interest expense by approximately $2.8 million. Based on the amount of outstanding variable rate debt, we have material exposure to interest rate risk. In the future, if our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variable rate debt, we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk. The nature and amount of our long term and short term debt, as well as the proportionate amount of fixed rate and variable rate debt, can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. 52
